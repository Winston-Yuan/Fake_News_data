My son<U+2019>s wanted to go there forever, and I feel really good about the amount of cash I sent them, so hopefully I have a decent shot. Fingers crossed.<U+201D> At press time, sources reported that Fring had become excited after receiving an envelope from Vanderbilt, only to quickly grow dejected upon opening it and finding a simple form letter thanking him for his gift.

VA Backlog Means Thousands Of Veterans Owed Money In NC By Arnaldo Rodgers on November 2, 2016 VA \nBy Faith Abubey \nRoughly 7,400 veterans who use the Kernersville, Charlotte and Salisbury Veterans Affairs health care and medical centers are waiting on travel reimbursements, some of which were supposed to have been processed back in July. \nUPDATE: As of November 1st, the Salisbury VA offices now say they have begun processing travel vouchers for October. The vouchers will be processed in sequential date order. \nThe backlog is affecting veterans like Lee, who is reluctant to use his full name because he fears there might be backlash against him for speaking out about the delays. \n<U+201C>I don<U+2019>t know what kind of adverse action might be taken against me,<U+201D> the Air Force veteran said. <U+201C>[The VA employees] have a good job.

Public School 9, Teunis G. Bergen, located at 80 Underhill experienced a 2-hour delay. Many New Yorkers were enraged with polling-site corruption, as they stood on long lines to no avail.

This produced a 2-hour delay for voters. Yorkville Community School located at 412 E. 88th Street, only had one of six ballot scanners working, producing a 2-block line. New Yorkers throughout the city are enraged about the polling site corruption they have experienced.

        "content": " posted by Eddie This remarkable photo is the last thing Japan<U+2019>s lost satellite, Hitomi, captured. Black holes with their ability to consume an entire galaxy, are perhaps the most feared object in the heavens due to the voracious appetite which they hold. It has now been discovered that black holes also have the ability to also feed the growth of galaxies. Black holes effectively affect and control the growth and expansion of galaxies, acting as a kind of regulator. It appears from recent discoveries that the universe has a life and death cycle for its heavenly bodies. Black holes appear to be at the center of this life cycle, a kind of grim reaper and giver of life all rapped up into one clever little package. The discovery of this process was noted by a Japanese satellite shortly before its unfortunate demise. The satellite had been focused on the Perseus Cluster which has at its center a super massive black hole. Data from the satellite demonstrated that black holes provide energy for the growth of galaxies. Remember that energy is never lost but instead changed and transformed as time moves on so it makes sense that black holes both absorb and expel energy. Energy is transformed and never destroyed, not even by black holes. Black holes are formed when a star of enormous magnitude ultimately burns out, and the core collapses into a black hole. The process of a star dying out is a kin to what happens when a nuclear reactor melts down which is both an awesome and terrifying event. Once formed, the black hole absorbs anything which winds up in its path, which includes entire galaxies. The magnitude of such destruction of mass is overwhelming and difficult for the human mind process. \nsource:",

McCaskill 10/03/16 04:40 PM EDT Hillary Clinton has regained a national lead over Donald Trump, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Monday. Clinton tops Trump with 47 percent to his 42 percent among likely voters, transforming what had been a narrow deficit before the first presidential debate last week to a 5-point advantage. Story Continued Below Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein round out the four-way matchup with 7 percent and 2 percent support, respectively. The survey was conducted entirely after the Clinton-Trump faceoff Monday night at Hofstra University in New York, which the Democratic presidential nominee went into trailing her rival by 2 percentage points, 43 percent to 45 percent. While Clinton<U+2019>s debate performance may have bolstered her standing, it also may have improved her favorability, if only ever so slightly. Clinton and Trump still have high negatives, but Clinton<U+2019>s standing has improved since the last CNN/ORC survey (minus 14 percent to minus 11 percent), while Trump<U+2019>s has worsened (minus 9 percent to minus 20 percent). The survey of 1,213 likely voters was conducted Sept. 28 <U+2013> Oct. 2 via landlines and cellphones. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.

Other firefighters were spotted waving at the plane as it passed. The tradition of a water cannon salute is typically reserved for ceremonial purposes. Historically, it has been used at airports to mark important occasions like the retirement of senior pilots and air traffic controllers. It is an immense display of respect.

The warrant comes two days after FBI Director James Comey announced a review of the emails in connection with Clinton's private email server, which she used during her tenure as secretary of state. Comey indicated it was unclear how significant the newly located emails were, if at all. Story Continued Below Several TV networks reported the issuance of the warrant Sunday night. The search warrant was apparently necessary because the warrant used to seize the laptop and other devices from Weiner earlier this month was focused on evidence that he allegedly exchanged sexually explicit messages with an underage girl. The new warrant would broaden that search. Abedin is said to be cooperating with officials, but it<U+2019>s unclear whether she was officially asked for consent to search the laptop. 2016 By Gabriel Debenedetti Since the announcement, several lawmakers have lashed out at Comey for the timing of his announcement. Most recently, Sen. Harry Reid wrote a letter to Comey saying he might have broken the law by unfairly interfering in the election. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sunday morning, 63 percent of likely voters said the newly disclosed FBI review makes no difference in how they will vote, with 34 percent of likely voters saying they are less likely to vote for Clinton.

Now, a series of polls prove that he is onto something. For weeks, the media has been trying to make it look like the race is over for Trump, claiming that he has virtually no chance of beating Clinton in the election. This is a dangerous claim because it could discourage Republican voters from taking the time to vote. According to a recent poll from LA Times-USC Dornsife, Trump has a 5.4 lead over Hillary right before the election. The latest numbers show Trump at 48% and Clinton at 42%. Clinton took a massive hit last week after the FBI announced they would be reopening the investigation into her use of a private email server as Secretary of State. Don<U+2019>t be fooled<U+2014>Trump has a very real chance of winning this election, especially in light of the fact that the investigation against Clinton has just been reopened. What do you think?

Veterans, Feeling Abandoned, Stand by Donald Trump By Arnaldo Rodgers on November 3, 2016 Veterans \nBY NICHOLAS CONFESSORE The roster of retired military officers endorsing Hillary Clinton in September glittered with decoration and rank. One former general led the American surge in Anbar, one of the most violent provinces in Iraq. Another commanded American-led allied forces battling the Taliban in Afghanistan. Yet another trained the first Iraqis to combat Islamic insurgents in their own country. But as Election Day approaches, many veterans are instead turning to Donald J. Trump, a businessman who avoided the Vietnam draft and has boasted of gathering foreign policy wisdom by watching television shows. Even as other voters abandon Mr. Trump, veterans remain among his most loyal supporters, an unlikely connection forged by the widening gulf they feel from other Americans. \nRead the Full Article at www.nytimes.com >>>> Related Posts: No Related Posts The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VNN, VNN authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.

This of course closely mirrors recent Pentagon talk of wars in the decades to come. \nThe timing of his calls for extreme US bellicosity are centered on trying to influence the upcoming US election in favor of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who has campaigned heavily on picking fights in Syria and against Russia.
