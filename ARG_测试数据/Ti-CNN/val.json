I think it's a symbol for all of us against sexual assault.<U+201D> \nHe said his intention was to sell pieces of the star to raise money for the women who have accused Trump of sexual wrongdoing. None of the women have provided concrete proof of their claims. \nThe man, a self-proclaimed activist, admitted in an exclusive TMZ interview that this isn't his first rodeo: \n<U+201C>I'm a non violent activist. I've been arrested 24, 25 times. I'd love to go to court with Mr. Trump, it would be a great honor.<U+201D> \nWithout irony, the man claimed that Trump is <U+201C>a bully<U+201D> and that he needs to <U+201C>ease up.<U+201D> \nThis isn't the first time Trump's star has been the target of vandals. Recently, the star was surrounded by a cement box: \nImage Credit: Screengrab/ YouTube \nUnfortunately for Mr. Otis, police are currently looking for him, with the possibility that he'll be charged with a felony. Additionally, the star he destroyed in the name of justice is worth $30,000.",

The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, was down 0.5% to 91.21. The dollar had risen for 10 consecutive trading sessions, its longest winning streak since May 2012. The greenback has surged since the Nov. 8 presidential election, as investors bet President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s plans to boost fiscal spending and cut taxes will support U.S. growth. Investors have also grown more confident that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest-rates next month, a move expected to support the dollar by making the currency more attractive to yield-seeking investors. Fed-funds futures, a popular tool for traders to bet on U.S. interest rate policy, shows a 95% probability that the Fed lifts rates at its December meeting, according to data from CME Group . Still, analysts have warned that the dollar<U+2019>s rapid rise has left the currency vulnerable to a selloff. Thin trading around the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S. this week could also exacerbate moves, analysts say. <U+201C>The rally has run too far, too fast,<U+201D> wrote analysts at TD Securities in a research note. <U+201C>Thin holiday trading could be one trigger for a squeeze given the scope for profit-taking.<U+201D> Meanwhile, emerging-market currencies rebounded against the dollar Monday after a sharp selloff. The dollar was down 0.9% against the Brazilian real, 1% against the Mexican peso and 0.2% against the Singapore dollar. A stronger dollar pressures emerging markets by making their dollar-denominated debt more expensive to pay back, while higher U.S. interest-rates make assets in countries like Mexico and Brazil less attractive to investors searching for yield.

Spoiler alert: they are good for your second amendment rights. According to recent reports, rap artist Steven Henry recently asked Clinton if she had seen his music video, <U+201C>Gone Hunting,<U+201D> which shows his family on a hunting trip. Clinton responded by commenting that hunting in general needs to change in this country. She argued that there aren<U+2019>t enough laws in place to protect animals, and essentially deemed hunting evil. The reports indicate Clinton confirmed she would endorse the confiscation of firearms for this purpose. What do you think? Does Clinton need to be kept far away from the White House?",

Last, the good news. It comes from Cleveland, where the Indians, a team that has not won a series since 1948, played against the Chicago Cubs, which has not won since 1908. In a blast of poesy, Mr. Rosenthal, quoting his wife, Mary Beth, reflects on the contest of underdogs that is this year<U+2019>s World Series, and pronounces baseball a game that is <U+201C>all about heart.<U+201D> Plus, says Mr. Rosenthal, <U+201C>it<U+2019>s an American game, a great series, and it is not about the election.<U+201D> Susan Lehman is host.",

Clinton never addressed her audience, which emptied out throughout the evening, and never made any public appearances on Tuesday, the apparent culmination of a turbulent campaign. \"Well, folks, I know you've been here a long time, and it's been a long night, and it's been a long campaign,<U+201D> said Podesta. \"But I can say: we can wait a little longer, can't we?\" Brent Griffiths contributed to this report.

McCaskill 11/07/16 09:34 AM EST Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump nationally by 4 percentage points, according to a pair of polls released on the last day before the presidential election. ABC News/Washington Post and CBS News surveys out Monday show Clinton heading into Election Day with a moderate lead over Trump in a four-person race among likely voters that includes Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Story Continued Below In the ABC/News Washington tracking poll, Clinton garners 47 percent support, followed by Trump at 43 percent, Johnson at 4 percent and Stein at 1 percent. Clinton leads by 10 points among the 36 percent of respondents who said they have cast early votes, 53 percent to 43 percent. Clinton's lead is by the same margin in the CBS News poll, in which she tops Trump, 45 percent to 41 percent. Johnson registers at 5 percent, and Stein sits at 2 percent. Four percent are undecided, and only 5 percent said they could change their minds. Nearly two-thirds of the respondents said they knew who they were voting for before September. Eleven percent decided in September, 10 percent earlier in October, 7 percent in the past two weeks, and 5 percent in the last week. And a majority of likely voters (55 percent) think Clinton will win the election. The ABC News/Washington Post poll of 2,220 likely voters was conducted Nov. 3-6 via landlines and cellphones.

Stewart spent the majority of the election season calling Trump and his supporters racists, sexists, and bigots. <U+201C>I would consider getting in a rocket and going to another planet because clearly this planet<U+2019>s gone bonkers,<U+201D> he said in an interview with People magazine. \nThe list also includes the ever-peachy Lena Dunham, who promised to stand by her threat no matter what. \n<U+201C>I know a lot of people have been threatening to do this, but I really will,<U+201D> Dunham said in April at an awards ceremony. <U+201C>I know a lovely place in Vancouver, and I can get my work done from there.<U+201D> \nBelow is a list of at least 23 celebrities who promised to leave if Trump won the election: \n<U+2022> Comedian Jon Stewart",

Huge civilian death tolls in recent Saudi attacks have added up to make the US a bit more gunshy than usual about supporting the Saudi war publicly. \nAt the same time, the US <U+201C>opposition<U+201D> to the air war is slim indeed, with the US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, insisting even in the announcement of their opposition to further strikes that the US supports Saudi Arabia<U+2019>s right to <U+201C>self-defense,<U+201D> which in this case included an outright invasion of a neighboring country. \nThe US has insisted Saudi aid is <U+201C>under review<U+201D> since a recent attack on a funeral. That said, there is no sign that any real changes in US policy were made, and the expectation is that, as always, US interest in growing arms exports will win out.",

In an op-ed and video published on CNN, Ryan said that the election offered a \"fundamental choice\" between \"the current path of decline\" and a \"better way that offers more freedom for every single American.\" Story Continued Below Pledging a \"unified Republican government,\" Ryan offered a six-point plan for governing that outlined how Republicans will fight poverty, secure the border, grow the economy, and repeal Obamacare. Ryan said Hillary Clinton \"feels no such obligation\" to address the country's problems, slamming the Democratic nominee on her ongoing email controversies and her labeling of a portion of Trump fans as \"deplorables.\" He also hit the Clintons for \"using the system to enrich themselves.\" \"If Republicans do not turn out -- if we sit this one out -- we will open the door not just to Hillary Clinton but also a Democratic Congress eager to give her a blank check,\" he warned. Ryan joined Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence on the campaign trail Saturday in the speaker's home state of Wisconsin. The speaker had previously backed off from campaigning with Trump following the release of a 2005 tape in which Trump talked about sexually assaulting women.

What it says is the same thing that the F.B.I. concluded after a long investigation into her use of a private email server: There is no basis to prosecute Mrs. Clinton. What it presumes is that it is the president<U+2019>s prerogative to decide whether prosecutions go forward or not. In a constitutional republic, decisions about whom to prosecute are the purview of law enforcement, not of elected officials generally, and certainly not of political opponents. Expressions of relief over Mr. Trump<U+2019>s decision that do not also take him to task for arrogating this power to himself tacitly affirm a form of government at odds with the principles of our constitutional republic.

When that's the case, the same usually also goes for rabbits, chickens, birds, and any other animal creature that could possibly live alongside people! However, there are lots of dogs who absolutely love and adore having other pet companions around. They thrive off the constant company and enjoy always having someone else to play around or cuddle up with. That's exactly how the dog in this funny video clip feels, but out of all the possible pets his owner could get him, he only has eyes for one. He has his heart set on an adorable fuzzy kitten and a sweet little tabby cat sister would be the absolute perfect addition to his life! The hilarious clip of the black and white dog talking excitedly about finally getting a new cat has already captured the hearts of over six million people and it's easy to see why. The dog was given a voice courtesy of his owner and it's spot on in terms of his actions, words, and mouth movement! The pair hold a quite an interesting conversation and if you've ever talked to your pet, all this may look and sound familiar to you. The silly voice works great and you just have to see and hear it for yourself so check it out and enjoy! Related:",

        "content": " by Yves Smith \nYves here. This is a very important video from the Real News Network , and I wish there were a transcript, so do take the trouble to listen to it. \nOne of the reasons for the ferocity of the howling from the Democratic Party hackocracy in the wake of the unexpected Trump vicory is that they are effectively cornered animals. As political scientist Tom Ferguson explains, the Democrats can<U+2019>t get the number of voters they need with their traditional coalition of Big Finance money plus identity politics without delivering tangible benefits to workers, which they have abjectly failed to do. But the power of mone in the Democratic party makes it well nigh impossible for them to devise the sort of populist policies that would appeal to voters that Trump has successfully peeled off. \nFerguson also has some important exit poll and early, granular data that debunks some cherished Democratic party myths. For instance, playing the gender card wasn<U+2019>t as successful as the media would lead you to believe. \nFerguson, who has been a consistent critic of the Democrats from the left, does not rule out the idea that Trump could deliver on policies that would make him popular, most important, ones that would create more jobs and improve wages. One expert close to the Sanders camp came to the same view separately months ago. So while Trump may be stymied, or may never have been sincere about his battle call to downtrodden workers, it<U+2019>s a mistake to rule out the possibility that he will continue to succeed despite the odds and his glaring character defects. 0 0 0 0 0 1",
