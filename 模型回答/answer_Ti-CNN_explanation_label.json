        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: truthdig.com \n text: <U+201C>Invisible Nation: Homeless Families in America<U+201D> A book by Richard Schweid \nAbout a quarter century ago, I taught a film course at UC San Diego. I drove from my home in Los Angeles once a week, returning the same day after my evening class. After one class session, some students requested to see me the next morning because they were unable to make my late afternoon office hours before class. I consented and stayed in San Diego that night. \nFailing to find any local friends at that hour, I looked for an inexpensive motel. The clerk at a relatively nearby dump stood behind a glass partition and handed me the room key after I paid the cash-only daily rate. He sternly informed me that no visitors were allowed. The room smelled of cigarettes and looked extremely unappealing. The carpet was filthy and deeply stained. I never removed my socks the entire night. The foul smelling bathroom sink was also stained. I slept fitfully on the threadbare, unwashed sheets and kept the bathroom light on all night. At 6 a.m., I rose and left, feeling as though I had been released from jail. \nRichard Schweid<U+2019>s remarkable and disconcerting new book, <U+201C>Invisible Nation: Homeless Families in America,<U+201D> brought back my unpleasant San Diego motel memory. This exceptional work of journalism chronicles the lives of America<U+2019>s homeless families, focusing dramatically on the plight of the thousands of homeless children, many living for protracted periods in motels eerily similar to my dreadful San Diego <U+201C>fleabag.<U+201D> Schweid traveled through a nation that privileged Americans generally try to avoid and deny. These more fortunate Americans are embarrassed, indifferent and sometimes actively hostile to the desperate plight of their hidden neighbors. Schweid<U+2019>s book is a compelling account of his findings. \nThroughout much of the 20th century, the homeless in America consisted primarily of men, often wandering from location to location. As late as 1980, families comprised only 1 percent of the homeless population. That number is now 37 percent, not only a huge increase, but a national catastrophe. Entire families now live in the streets, in cars, in temporary shelters, and often in one miserable motel room, waiting for some permanent relief in the form of a stable apartment. Schweid examined family homelessness in five U.S. cities: Nashville, Tennessee; Boston; Fairfax, Virginia; Portland, Oregon; and Trenton, New Jersey. He lived in the motels he described and listened carefully to the families<U+2019> stories, the basis for his grim observations and conclusions. \nThe accounts of family motel stays are the most dramatic feature of the book. Single mothers (and sometimes fathers) with one or more children are greeted by mildewed shower curtains, cigarette stains and lingering odors, cracked mirrors, stained rugs and sheets (often with holes) and other physical indignities, including roaches. Young boys and girls eat only what can be cooked in motel room microwaves and hot plates, often subsisting on the unhealthy fast food options from nearby restaurants and convenience stores. A lack of refrigerator space ensures that sugary beverages and precooked lunchmeats are common; fresh fruits and vegetables are rare or nonexistent in most of these motel settings. \nEspecially in cold weather states, children can play only in motel corridors, often encountering unsavory residents and visitors with criminal and drug histories and involvements. The children usually wait in these corridors for buses to transport them to schools, which they change with devastating regularity as their families move from motels to shelters and other temporary housing facilities. \nAll too regularly, families are evicted from these barely habitable motel rooms, invariably for not paying the (exorbitant) rent. Typically, they are locked out and lose their meager possessions. Schweid makes the point with heartbreaking poignancy: <U+201C>Children<U+2019>s toys and favorite things were gone forever. Anyone who has ever watched a young child form an attachment to some beat-up raggedy doll, some scrap of material ... will understand that its sudden overnight loss may generate terrible anxiety.<U+201D> \nThe results are distressingly predictable. Children residing in these motels (and shelters) frequently act out in school and perform poorly. Physically, they suffer from a multitude of ailments, including ear infections, asthma, skin disorders, dental decay, obesity, depression and many others. Some of these are serious and chronic, and can have lifelong detrimental effects. Failure to address childhood dental problems, for example, often leads to massive tooth loss, gastrointestinal disorders and emotional trauma, among other consequences. \n<U+201C>Invisible Nation<U+201D> also addresses the plight of homeless families in shelters, many run by local governments and sometimes assisted by churches and other charitable organizations. With minor variations, these shelters are the same in all five cities where Schweid conducted his investigations. The chief difference between shelters and motel rooms is that shelter food is generally better, and sanitary facilities like showers and toilets are generally superior. But privacy is conspicuously lacking, causing even greater stress to homeless parents and children. \nA debilitating feature of many of these shelters, moreover, is that their temporary inhabitants must exit the premises early in the morning, forcing them out to the mean urban streets. In Boston, Fairfax, Trenton and Nashville, they can face freezing winter temperatures, while in Portland, they can encounter relentless winter rains. The shelters also impose strict, even punitive rules and regulations, further oppressing the temporary residents. These settings are understandably places of last resort for homeless families, who often have no relatives or friends with whom they can stay.",

It<U+2019>s important to acknowledge and thank our veterans not only on this day, but whenever the opportunity arises for their willingness to put their lives on the line for the common good. \nWhile our veterans may have fought in different battles throughout different eras, they all share the common experience of training, combating, and a life that is ever changing once they return from war with more than their duffle bags and dog tags. According to the National Association of Mental Health, nearly one in four veterans showed signs of mental illness conditions, such as PTSD, TBI or depression. For other veterans, learning how to live with the loss of a limb or immobility can be a long journey. \nHere are a few simple ways you can help make a difference on Veterans Day for our 23 million veterans Volunteer with DAV <U+2013> Disabled American Veterans is a non-profit charity organization dedicated to providing support to American veterans and their families. Volunteer with DAV and make a difference in the lives of our nation<U+2019>s heroes by driving veterans to appointments, participating in recreational programs or simply providing companionship to VA hospital patients. Understand Veteran Mental Health Issues <U+2013> According to a recent study by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, on average 22 veterans take their own lives each day. In addition, 1 in 5 people who commit suicide daily are veterans. Depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are the two most common challenges faced by veterans after returning to civilian life. Many of our veterans are suffering in silence, which is why they need our support. Connect with Veterans in Your Community- Social support for veterans from organizations such as VFW, American Legion and others in your local community can be strong factors against suicide. Reach out to these and other veterans organizations in your community to find out how you can help. When veterans feel connected to a community or has people to turn to, they are less likely to commit suicide. Know the Warning Signs of Depression <U+2013> Signs of depression include prolonged sadness or irritability, changes in sleep, appetite, energy, problems with memory and concentration, and increased alcohol consumption or substance abuse. One resource that is available 24/7 is the National Veterans Crisis Line (1-800-273-8255) Sponsor a Companion Dog <U+2013> More than a third of our veterans have or will experience PTSD from their time in the service. Puppies Behind Bars is a unique program which utilizes prisoners to train companion dogs for veterans suffering from PTSD. By sponsoring a dog or donating, you can help improve the life of a veteran.

Simply Say Thank You- The simplest gesture you can do to make an impact in the lives of a veteran is simply say <U+201C>thank you for your service.<U+201D> While it hardly takes any effort, many veterans have never heard the words. If you know a veteran or pass by someone in uniform, say <U+201C>Thanks!<U+201D> It may make his or her day. \nIt<U+2019>s important to find ways to get involved and show your appreciation to our veterans not just on November 11th but every day.

It is not clear where the restaurant is located. \n<U+201C>Were you smuggled in?<U+201D> Wang asks me. \n<U+201C>No,<U+201D> I say. \nI was born and raised in Maryland. My Mandarin has a noticeable American accent. I later realize it was a mistake to admit my legal status. Wang asks me a few questions about what type of restaurant jobs I want. She says she<U+2019>ll call me if anything comes up. \nShe doesn<U+2019>t call. Wang isn<U+2019>t alone. Other employment agencies in Flushing I contact also do not return my calls after hearing my Mandarin. \nChinese restaurants hire undocumented Chinese and Latino workers, pay them well below minimum wage, make them work 12-hour shifts six days a week but offer free housing and food. These workers are packed at night into roach-infested apartments and houses. Sometimes they are forced to sleep on cardboard in the basements of restaurants. They make $800 to $2,000 a month<U+2014>regardless of how many hours they work. \nMuch of their pay goes to fees charged by traffickers and smugglers<U+2014>known in Chinese as <U+201C>snakeheads<U+201D><U+2014>and to private employment agencies such as the one run by Wang that charges clients for finding them a job. The smugglers, like the agencies, do not advertise. Snakeheads charge $60,000 to $80,000 to smuggle someone into the United States. They have networks of enforcers, which means that, if you do not pay, you or your family members in China will be subject, until the money is paid, to beatings or even death. \nRestaurant jobs in big cities fill up fast. There are more immigrants looking for work in cities, where wealthier customers tip generously. Most employment agencies in Flushing specialize in sending immigrants to jobs in remote towns where Chinese restaurants are often short of staff. Once offered a job, an immigrant often has to be on a bus within hours and can find him- or herself halfway across the country. \nMy legal status and my American-accented Mandarin are impediments. Labor trafficking, which can take place before the immigrant is smuggled into the country, is dependent on the powerlessness of the worker. Snakeheads routinely lie about jobs, wages and employment conditions, knowing that once workers are in the United States they are unable to appeal to law enforcement. It is also common for snakeheads and employers to confiscate passports and identity documents in order to hold workers hostage. \nThese snakeheads do not only traffic in Chinese workers. They routinely <U+201C>buy<U+201D> undocumented Latino workers who have crossed into the United States from Mexico and drive them to Chinese restaurants around the country where they, too, are held in bondage. Those who traffic human beings also often traffic drugs, carrying narcotics along with their human cargo across state lines. \n<U+201C>Employment agencies buy Mexicans at the border from smugglers and sell them to Chinese employers,<U+201D> said a former snakehead I<U+2019>ll call Edward, whom I interviewed in Atlanta. For one year, the First Street Employment Agency paid Edward $2 per mile to pick up undocumented Latino immigrants from Fort Myers, Fla., and drive them to the agency in Chamblee, Ga. The employment agency owner would pack the Latino migrants into crowded rooms in a nearby apartment complex called the Don Juan Duplexes while he waited for Chinese restaurant owners to purchase the immigrants like indentured servants. \n<U+201C>Chinese restaurant owners don<U+2019>t pay Mexicans for the first two months of work. They pay the smugglers instead,<U+201D> Edward told me. <U+201C>They pay $1,000 per person, maybe $1,200 per person, to the smuggler.<U+201D> \nAfter two months, restaurant owners typically begin to pay new Latino workers $800 a month. They tend to work in the kitchen, so they don<U+2019>t receive tips. In busy restaurants, experienced kitchen workers might eventually make up to $2,000 a month. \nThe employment agencies, Chinese restaurants and human smugglers have informal ties to one another, which makes it efficient to supply cheap labor but difficult to prosecute. Most of these labor agencies are never charged with trafficking. \nI change my tactics when I enter Min Du Employment Agency on Eldridge Street in Manhattan<U+2019>s Chinatown. The agency<U+2019>s office is not much larger than a walk-in closet. A poster plastered on the wall advertises a $30 bus ride to Indiana. \n<U+201C>Hello, little sister,<U+201D> an elderly woman greets me in Mandarin from behind the counter. The small space behind her counter is stuffed with notebooks, instant-noodle packs and an electric kettle. \nI speak haltingly. I give vague answers about my ability to speak English. She doesn<U+2019>t ask about my immigration status. \nI tell her I<U+2019>m looking for a busgirl job. I decide on busgirl because I have limited Chinese writing skills and would struggle to write orders down in Chinese. \n<U+201C>The closest job is four hours away,<U+201D> she says. \n<U+201C>That<U+2019>s fine,<U+201D> I say. \nShe begins calling restaurant employers across North America and mumbles a few words to them before handing me the receiver. I get on the phone with a Chinese restaurant owner in Indiana.",

With results in all but two of the Senate races declared, the GOP emerged with 30 seats, with a Democrat, Sen. Simcha Felder, who caucuses with Republicans, giving them the 31. GOP Sen. Carl Marcellino of Long Island appeared poised to retain his seat, which would give the Republicans control of 32 seats. A Massapequa-area face-off between Democrat John Brooks and Republican Sen. Michael Venditto remained uncalled on Wednesday. On Long Island, Republican Elaine Phillips beat Democrat Adam Haber, 52% to 48%. But Democrats held on to another Nassau County seat: Sen. Todd Kaminsky, a former federal prosecutor, defeated GOP challenger Chris McGrath, 52% to 47%. <U+201C>We have grown our majority,<U+201D> Senate GOP spokesman Scott Reif said. Still, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats, Mike Murphy, said on Wednesday that the conference expected Mr. Venditto to win his race and for Democrat James Gaughran to pick up a seat in a race against Mr. Marcellino. The GOP <U+201C>took a premature victory lap and at the end of the counting we will have more Democrats in the chamber than Republicans,<U+201D> Mr. Murphy said. For the first time in several years, Democrats were within reach of taking the reins of the 63-person Senate from the GOP, but an 11th-hour addition to a breakaway faction of Democrats hurt those chances. And the coattails of a surprising presidential victory by Republican Donald Trump perhaps spelled a disappointing evening for down-ballot Democrats in New York. It remained unclear how the so-called Independent Democratic Conference, a five-member group that has aligned itself in a power-sharing agreement with Republicans, would position itself in the next legislative session, though chances that the group would realign itself with Democrats are slim. Earlier in the week, the group picked up another member, Sen. Jesse Hamilton, a Brooklyn Democrat. The group is also expected to pick up a seventh addition, Marisol Alcantara, a Democrat who won her race to succeed outgoing Sen. Adriano Espaillat. Mr. Felder, the Brooklyn Democrat who caucuses with the GOP, declined to comment on Tuesday<U+2019>s election results. Asked if he would continue to caucus with the Republicans next year, he said: <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t want to answer.<U+201D> The control of the Senate has significant consequences for Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who prides himself on bipartisanship and has at times used the GOP<U+2019>s leadership position in the Senate to shield himself from complaints about the lack of progress on some liberal agenda items. This year, sensing Democrats could end up in command of the chamber, Mr. Cuomo endorsed and held events for several candidates, including Messrs. Kaminsky and Haber.

Following Judgment? page: 1 Jesus to St Faustina: You will prepare the world for My final coming. (Diary 429) Speak to the world about My mercy ... It is a sign for the end times. After it will come the Day of Justice. While there is still time, let them have recourse to the fountain of My mercy. (Diary 848) Tell souls about this great mercy of Mine, because the awful day, the day of My justice, is near. (Diary 965). I am prolonging the time of mercy for the sake of sinners. But woe to them if they do not recognize this time of My visitation. (Diary 1160) Before the Day of Justice, I am sending the Day of Mercy. (Diary 1588) He who refuses to pass through the door of My mercy must pass through the door of My justice. (Diary 1146). The Jubilee Year of Mercy proclaimed by pope Francis, ends on November 20th the feast of Christ the King the end of the liturgical year. Every jubilee year is destined to end of course, that's why it is a year and not a decade.But...isn't it too much prophecy gathered in that last year? First of all, the Catholics expect earnestly the 100th anniversary of Fatima. The 100th year started on October 13 and would end on October 13, 2017. As pope Benedict said during his pontificate on his trip to Fatima, the 100th year will see the Fatima secrets fulfilled. Then, we had all kinds of predictions recently. Let only remember the once at the time Jewish rabbis predictions of the year 5776, encoded in Bible codes according to some of them, that also appeared to be the 49th jubilee year since the retaking of Jerusalem. \"Nothing happened, again\" would say many. Much happened in terms that might be the last quiet year before the events. Then we have the enigmatic wishes on the last Christmas of both pope and queen as if that would be our last Christmas? The wordings were vague enough to draw firm conclusion, anyway they were said and stirred public interest. There are more predictions, such as of major Solar kill shot, that even president Obama signed orders in case it happens. The French foreign minister said of 500 days before climate chaos, days that expired last Fall. How much more mercy is envisioned by God, in what time frames? If the sequence given in Garabandal of Great Warning- Miracle - Chastisement is to be accomplished before the 100th anniversary of Fatima, it seems God's mercy towards the entire world would end in less than a year time. The only possible date for the Miracle in 2017 would fall on April 13, Holy Thursday. Let make a distinction, mercy to individuals who accepted God's loving call, NEVER ENDS! But God is a just judge at the same time. The Chastisement is predicted by too many prophecies and cannot be disregarded as nonsense. Moreover,t he world today is in a worse shape than during the end of the Cold War. I don't know what exactly will follow, there are variety of scenarios each of them having its own justification and logic to exist. May be a combination of them will happen in reality. What is exactly Great Warning, is it only what is said to be by numerous seers, far not only those in Garabandal? For me it should include ET-angelic component. Time will tell. Time that runs out, according to Anguera and other apparitions of Virgin Mary. That doesn't mean it has all to happen on December 1st. Every next week draws us closer to the two doors, one of which is the Door of Mercy and the other the Door of Justice. Your take on recent catholic prophecy?

Story Continued Below In an interview on MSNBC on Saturday afternoon, Hughes said both candidates are flawed, but that undecided voters should look at the trajectory for the future, using the Supreme Court as an example. \"I think you can't really say one is worse than the other,\" she said of both Hillary Clinton and Trump. \"For me as a conservative, I look at who Trump has surrounded himself with, Mike Pence, really smart people.\" Trump has appeared in Playboy magazine and made a cameo appearance in a porn video, and has recently come under fire for comments he made in a recovered 2005 video where he makes light of sexual assault.

Take Katie McGinty, the Pennsylvania Democrat attempting to unseat Senator Pat Toomey. Ms. McGinty is an old Clinton hand, starting as an aide to Al Gore and rising in the 1990s to chair the White House Council on Environmental Quality for nearly six years. From 2003 to 2008 she was the secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) under Governor Ed Rendell. At DEP Ms. McGinty led the successful push for the 2008 Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard Act, which requires utilities to generate 18% of Pennsylvania<U+2019>s electricity from wind, solar and other renewables by 2020. She also steered $2.7 million in grants from the Growing Greener Watershed Protection Program to an environmental nonprofit that employed her husband as a consultant. The state ethics board ruled that the arrangement violated financial conflict-of-interest laws. For Ms. McGinty, this was merely a down payment. After she left the Rendell administration, she moved seamlessly into lucrative positions at companies she used to regulate or had subsidized, or both, all of which operated under her green-energy mandate and most of which received more DEP subsidies. In 2009 she took a seat on the board of Iberdrola USA, the U.S. subsidiary of a Spanish utility. At DEP Ms. McGinty had made nearly $20 million in grants and loan guarantees to Gamesa , in which Iberdrola owned a controlling investment stake, to locate two windmill-making factories in Cambria and Bucks counties. The plants were built but have since shut down. In 2005 Ms. McGinty gave Community Energy, another Iberdrola subsidiary, $1 million to build a wind farm using Gamesa turbines. Also at DEP, Ms. McGinty lobbied Mr. Rendell to serve as a character witness for Iberdrola<U+2019>s <U+201C>good corporate citizenship,<U+201D> according to a 2008 letter she wrote. He followed through and urged then-New York Governor David Paterson to approve a merger of Iberdrola and Energy East, a utility in New York and New England that had nothing to do with Pennsylvania. After hiring Ms. McGinty, Iberdrola received a $10 million stimulus grant, as selected by her DEP successor, to build a wind farm in Fayette County. Her campaign-finance disclosures show she earned $100,000 a year as a director. From 2008 to 2013, Ms. McGinty made $1.1 million on the board of NRG Energy , a Pennsylvania utility. She resigned to become chief of staff to Democratic Governor Tom Wolf and emailed her old pals at NRG in 2015: <U+201C>Miss all you guys and look forward to a big NRG solar push in PA. Please let me know if I can help in any way.<U+201D> The feeling is mutual. Finance disclosures show that the political-action committees of both Iberdrola USA and NRG Energy are donors to Ms. McGinty<U+2019>s Senate campaign. There<U+2019>s so much more similar material<U+2014>her pre- and post-DEP involvement with Plextronics, a Pittsburgh solar company; Weston Solutions, a green consulting firm; Thar Energy, a corn ethanol maker<U+2014>but we<U+2019>ll leave it there for now. We<U+2019>ve argued that the euphemism <U+201C>public service<U+201D> has become a form of deferred compensation, and the Clintons aren<U+2019>t the only well-connected political operators profiting where big government and big business meet. Pennsylvania voters should wonder whether Ms. McGinty wants to be a Senator to defend their interests and the public trust or merely enhance her influence-trading resume.",

No criminal charges were filed, but MF Global paid $132 million earlier this year in a civil settlement with MF Global customers.\nTeneo<U+2019>s seemingly seedy behavior has long been a problem for the Clintons, and its alleged involvement in the MF Global scandal rippled across Clinton world. As revealed by an email chain published by Wikileaks, the Teneo-MF Global story was emailed to Chelsea Clinton the same days as publication, December 5, 2011.\nResponding a day later , Chelsea told those in the email chain, which apparently included John Podesta, that this was not the first time Teneo had been a problem:\nJohn, Bruce, Terry, Victoria, Jennifer <U+2013> fyi re: below. I<U+2019>ve asked that it make my father<U+2019>s clips (it wld historically not as I understand it).\nOn another note, I was in London Sunday and did a Foundation event Sunday evening and two people separately voiced concerns directly to me about Teneo , neither of whom I know well (one of whom is a friend of one of Marc<U+2019>s old colleagues, ie we know only tangentially) and Sara Latham (whom Victoria and Jennifer, I do know well <U+2013> she worked for my Dad in the WH and lives in London) voiced serious concerns to Bari <U+2013> including telling her Ilya has called Members of the House and Members of Parliament, <U+201C>on behalf of President Clinton,<U+201D> for Teneo clients (eg for Andrew Liveris and Dow who<U+2019>s coming this month to London), without my father<U+2019>s knowledge and inelegantly and ineffectually at best and at worse has now precipitating people in London making comparisons between my father and Tony Blair<U+2019>s profit motivations. Which would horrify my father.\nSara also told Bari she started working for Teneo, as Teneo, more than a year ago and then recently stopped because she was so upset, partly because of what Doug and Declan asked her to do/ pretend was happening for their clients at Davos- that<U+2019>s all I know. I am hoping to connect directly with Sara this week, if only to connect her belatedly into Victoria and Jennifer. I<U+2019>m speaking at an innovations in governance conference today here in Oxford and flying back later this afternoon. I will raise all of this and more with my father this evening. Wanted to update you all in the meanwhile about my augmented concerns post London and the below.\n<U+201C>Doug and Declan<U+201D> are Doug Band and Declan Kelly, founding members of Teneo and longtime associates of the Clinton family.\nChelsea Clinton is telling those on the thread in response to a press clip of the Human Events piece that she has been told by other people that Teneo is trading on her father<U+2019>s name for dubious purposes.\nIn response to Chelsea<U+2019>s email, John Podesta emailed Clinton lawyer Cheryl Mills saying <U+201C>We need to move to a resolution of this quickly.<U+201D>\nMills responded with a document that restructured Teneo, which Mills explained, <U+201C>essentially creates a full-time Personal office of the President headed by a new CEO/COS. That person <U+2014> who is unaffiliated with any of the entities or Teneo <U+2014> b/cs the decisionmaker on the allocation of the President<U+2019>s time and management and implementation of the President<U+2019>s desires with respect to each activity. Doug and Justin advise that person but do not make final decisions or have final implementation authority on any matters <U+2013> which is consistent with what Doug has said he seeks <U+2013> the ability to recommend but for others to be accountable for making the ultimate decisions.<U+201D>\nWhile Chelsea was concerned with Teneo using Bill Clinton, other evidence demonstrates it was a two-way street. Teneo helped Bill Clinton make millions of dollars from speeches with corporations. They also helped raised large amounts of money for the Clinton Foundation and employed other associates of the Clintons.\nLike most Clinton operations, it<U+2019>s never quite clear where the public service ends and the private gains begin.\nThe post Clinton Network Concerned About Teneo<U+2019>s Consulting Behavior appeared first on Shadowproof .\n",

It<U+2019>s that simple.<U+201D><U+2014>Michael K. Smith \nAs millions prepare to do just what Smith warns against, including hundreds of thousands who think themselves dedicated to ending such control, it<U+2019>s time we understand American mind management<U+2019>s great success at reducing voters to herds of human cattle whether from a conservative right, a liberal left, or trapped in the middle of the political desert called the two party system under one class control. \nReducing otherwise thoughtful Americans to sinking intellectually lower than those they are taught to disrespect as uneducated and worse, we find an allegedly liberal population that might make Germans during the Nazi era seem civil libertarians by comparison. The all consuming state of the mind managed and consciousness controlled<U+2014>the greater the conflict, the tighter the control<U+2014>finds supposedly educated groups reacting with all the critical thoughtfulness of a dog leaving its droppings on the pavement. And a likeness to excrement might be raising the level of debate, given the atrocities of persuasion used to reduce America<U+2019>s political arena to a giant national toilet. Consider only a few of the glaring contradictions hardly given a thought by innocents who exercise more choice while shopping for clothes, pet food, weapons or drugs than in the political marketplace where they, instead of the products, are branded. And let<U+2019>s remember the origin of this ugly overused term which originally meant burning into the flesh of an animal or human slave the <U+201C>brand<U+201D> of its owner. Whose <U+201C>brand<U+201D> are you? \nPeople taught that freedom of speech and thought are cherished ideals are programmed into vilifying those who dare to speak or think differently than they. While the all too easy examples of religious fundamentalists suppressing the freedom of one or another minority or the right to openly speak about beliefs that contradict the accepted code are cited by a purportedly secular liberal sector as narrow minded bigotry, it is as guilty, often proudly so, of the same behavior. \nFor example, when a rich, silicon valley techmeister dared to contradict the hypothetically free thinking libertarian mindset of the market fundamentalist community who make up the majority of the rich IT class, the reaction was swift and as tolerant as any Nazi embargo on thought. Previously lauded by a gay liberal publication for being rich and homosexual as well, he became a villain and un-gay for being a supporter of Donald Trump. And liberals too young to remember or too ignorant to know about the anti-Soviet frenzy of the Cold War are aroused to react to Putin and Russia the way the people they treat with utter contempt might react to an abortion being performed at the altar during their church service. A supposed community of gay rights advocates doesn<U+2019>t accept gays who don<U+2019>t toe the party line of such supporters, while alleged anti-war oriented people operate in a controlled mental state lusting for war as the country moves closer to a military confrontation with Russia, provoked by sources of propaganda they formerly opposed moving them to think<U+2014>if at all<U+2014>from their lower anatomy, in the fashion of the candidate they are programmed to hate. \nA rapidly diminishing economic system that still rewards a substantial minority with comfort and privilege while giving the class above them that brands their professions measures of wealth beyond belief, is made to feel superior to the majority who carry the burden of social costs to finance their personal benefits. This results in great numbers of people looking down on those below them in the economic stratification of 21 st century capitalism, approaching that of its centuries old origins in comfort for some and squalor for most. Thus, those able to afford education, a shrinking minority and <U+201D>diverse<U+201D> in the divide and conquer modes of identitarian affirmation, are taught to disrespect those with less ability to pay the educational premiums or qualify for the massive debt required. The majority of Americans, without college degrees and forced to accept even more limited work than those who make it through the paper mills and become lawyers, teachers or as often, baristas, are seen as less able to think or perform in the capitalist marketplace and become subjects of blame for all the worst aspects of the game. \nInequality, racism, sexism, problems of immigration, gentrification and many other aspects of what passes for normal political economics are seen as the fault or responsibility of <U+201C>others.<U+201D> And the majority group, carefully splintered into as many ethnic, religious and ugliest and most ignorant of all, racial minorities<U+2014>thus with less chance to perform as the majority we truly are<U+2014>are driven to reactionary minority political organization which seems the only answer to other reactionary minority opposition given that action of a majority is treated as a work of fiction or desire of folly. Meanwhile, imperial warfare, Wall Street, Corporate America, the richest 1%, its well paid servants and Israeli interests continue to take up the lion<U+2019>s share of the nation<U+2019>s wealth as alleged market competition becomes the anti-social reality of the most while a perverted form of wealthy socialism exists with benefits for only the least. \nWith established billionaires, through their banks and lobbies like NRAIPAC, maintaining control whichever of the deadly duo is elected by well meaning lesser evilites, the need for a radical politics of truly revolutionary and not simply social democratic change will become more pressing. The identity group of those with enough money to matter no matter what their skin tone, religion or ethnicity, needs to join with masses whose lives matter much less because they haven<U+2019>t enough money to matter, no matter what their skin tone, ethnicity or religion. The most democratic, humane and efficient system will not happen until it<U+2019>s created by people who understand that with all the horrid treatment of people of different caste and color, the primary division and barrier among all of humanity is that of economic class. With all the nonsense about an alleged problem of growing population, no one goes without food, shelter, education or healthcare because there isn<U+2019>t enough of those things, but only because they haven<U+2019>t enough money to pay for them and return a profit to the marketeers who sell them. \nWe now have capital<U+2019>s representatives from all supposed minorities in Congress, on Wall street, in the military, as CEOs of major corporations and just about everything else. Whether the private profits accrue to heterosexuals, homosexuals, people of light skin tone, dark skin tone, or with accents that identify them as from Mexico, Brooklyn or Serbo-Croatia, they come at public expense. Instead of seeking other mind management created minorities to blame or see as enemies, we need to direct our focus at the rigged system of human inequality which allows some to thrive only at others<U+2019> failure. The only minority to deal with on a confrontational basis is the billionaire gang formerly confronted by some dedicated followers of the Bernie Sanders campaign, before they became sheep led to a voting booth to make sure that billionaire minority retains its domination. If only 5% of them vote for Jill Stein, the Greens will receive millions of public dollars to continue building a real alternative of hope for the future. When slavish obedience to mind managed lesser evil ends, we will begin building a better nation and world, but not until then. On the eighth, vote, inhale deeply and try to relax, if you can. And on the ninth, begin working for that change, if you haven<U+2019>t already. \nFrank Scott<U+2018>s political commentary and satire is online at legalienate.blogspot.com . Email:",

First of all, not all jeepneys you encounter are as colorful, shiny and clean as the one pictured here. If you are bothered by smoke or the smell of gasoline, remember to always carry and wear a disposable surgical mask. It also helps with, you know, body odor. In most cases, there are no jeepney stops like there are bus stops. Wherever you are, be rest assured that so long as there is room for one more passsenger, the jeepney will stop for you. Speaking of room, when the driver says the capacity of his jeepney is 10 passengers on either side, you can<U+2019>t argue. Ten means ten, even if only half your butt sits comfortably on the padded seat. Only cash payment is accepted, but you probably already know that. Exact fare is appreciated but Mr. Driver is happy to provide change except very early in the day. <U+201C>Barya lang po sa umaga!<U+201D> No five hundred peso bills in the morning, please. Jeepney fare is passed on from one passenger to another until it reaches the driver. The same is true for any change back due the passenger. It takes a village to ride the jeepney you know. If you don<U+2019>t want to be bothered by other passengers asking you to pass on the fare to the driver, sit as far as possible from the driver, assuming that premium spot is vacant. The jeepney driver would appreciate it so much if you pay your fare before you start texting on your mobile phone. <U+201C>God knows who doesn<U+2019>t pay,<U+201D> says one jeepney sign. There are two phrases you need to learn when riding the jeepney: <U+201C>Bayad po<U+201D> (here<U+2019>s my fare) and <U+201C>Para po<U+201D> (this is my stop). If you don<U+2019>t speak the language, no worries. Just pass on your fare to the passenger next to you and he or she will know what to do. And if you need to disembark, just knock on the jeepney<U+2019>s roof. It also means <U+201C>please stop.<U+201D> There are discounted fares for students and seniors. Be sure to say <U+201C>one senior<U+201D> or <U+201C>one student<U+201D> when paying your fare. Otherwise, you pay full fare. Filipinos have learned to respect seniors and people with disabilities. The spot closest to the jeepney entrance (farthest from the driver) is reserved for them. Isn<U+2019>t that nice? As always, hold on to the hand rails. It can be a very bumpy ride. Rate this:",

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/meltdown-at-justice-1477956287 \n text: Fewer than three of 10 Americans trust government to do the right thing always or most of the time, Gallup reports, and the years since 2007 are <U+201C>the longest period of low trust in government in more than 50 years.<U+201D> The details emerging about the multiple investigations into Hillary Clinton explain a lot about this ebbing public confidence in institutions such as the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation. Start with Attorney General Loretta Lynch. A cavalcade of former Justice heavyweights are now assailing FBI director James Comey for reopening the Clinton email file, and Justice sources are leaking that the director went rogue despite Ms. Lynch<U+2019>s counsel not to alert Congress so close to an election. But Mr. Comey works for the Attorney General. If she thinks Mr. Comey was breaking Justice rules by sending Friday<U+2019>s letter to Congress, then she had every right to order him not do so. If Mr. Comey sent the letter anyway, and he didn<U+2019>t resign, Ms. Lynch could then ask President Obama to fire him. Our guess is that she didn<U+2019>t order Mr. Comey not to send the letter precisely because she feared Mr. Comey would resign<U+2014>and cause an even bigger political storm. But the worst approach is to let a subordinate do something you believe is wrong and then whisper afterwards that you told him not to. The phrase for that is political cowardice. Ms. Lynch<U+2019>s abdication began when she and her prosecutors declined to empanel a grand jury. It continued in June after her supposedly coincidental rendezvous with Bill Clinton on a Phoenix airport tarmac. She could have told Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s husband that the appointment was inappropriate, or refused to let him board her plane. She says the conversation was <U+201C>social,<U+201D> but she allowed the ex-President to create the appearance of a conflict of interest. <U+201C>The fact that the meeting that I had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that I take seriously, and deeply and painfully,<U+201D> Ms. Lynch conceded at an Aspen forum in July. The Clinton campaign compounded the problem by gossiping to the press that Mrs. Clinton would keep Ms. Lynch on as AG if she wins. Ms. Lynch also abandoned her post when Mr. Comey staged his July media event dissecting the evidence in the Clinton email case and exonerating the Democratic nominee. The FBI<U+2019>s job is to build a case, not make prosecutorial decisions. Yet Ms. Lynch later told Congress that rather than make up her own mind on the evidence she would merely <U+201C>accept the recommendation of that team<U+201D> at the FBI <U+201C>and there was no basis not to accept it.<U+201D> Meanwhile, the Journal<U+2019>s Devlin Barrett broke the news Sunday that senior Justice officials and FBI officials disagreed over how aggressively to pursue the Clinton Foundation for financial fraud and influence peddling. FBI field agents<U+2014>in New York, Los Angeles, Washington and Little Rock, Arkansas<U+2014>wanted to pursue subpoenas and empanel a grand jury. Senior officials at Justice, likely political appointees, refused to give the FBI agents permission. But the agents continued to investigate under their current authorities, even after Justice denied their request to read the Clinton-related emails that the national-security team had uncovered. In August a <U+201C>very pissed off<U+201D> Justice official dressed down Andrew McCabe, the bureau<U+2019>s second-in-command who oversaw the Clinton email investigation, for looking at the Clinton Foundation in an election year. According to the Journal story, Mr. McCabe replied, <U+201C>Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?<U+201D> The official said no, but the message down the FBI chain of command was to <U+201C>stand down.<U+201D> This follows Mr. Barrett<U+2019>s previous scoop that Mr. McCabe<U+2019>s wife received $675,000 in campaign donations from Clinton comrade Terry McAuliffe for a Virginia legislature race. The FBI says there was no actual conflict of interest because Mr. McCabe detached himself from his wife<U+2019>s campaign, but the appearance of a conflict is egregious. Mr. McCabe should have been removed from the FBI probe. Democrats and their media allies are now in attack-and-deflect mode, assailing the FBI agents on the Clinton cases as <U+201C>conservative.<U+201D> But considering that the Journal story is the first public confirmation in the heat of election season that the Clinton Foundation is under investigation, the agents were handling the matter professionally and discreetly despite Washington interference. All of this reveals a Justice Department and FBI in turmoil, with some agents in semi-open revolt against their political leadership. This is terrible for those institutions, for confidence in government, and for Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s ability to govern if she does win next Tuesday<U+2019>s election. These events mean she could enter the Oval Office under criminal investigation, with her right-hand aide Huma Abedin suspected of concealing evidence, and Congress investigating these compromised investigations. The Clinton penchant for deception and secrecy bears much of the blame for this mess, but then so does the President who is currently responsible for the Justice Department. Mr. Obama sent his own bad political message when he twice suggested in interviews, in October 2015 and April 2016, that Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s unsecured email setup did not endanger national security and that she had no ill intent. The norm is for the chief U.S. law-enforcement officer not to comment on ongoing investigations, and Mr. Obama<U+2019>s prejudgment of the legal questions may have seeped down to the rank and file. In Mr. Obama<U+2019>s April 2016 absolution of Mrs. Clinton, the President said repeatedly that <U+201C>I guarantee that there is no political influence in any investigation conducted by the Justice Department, or the FBI, not just in this case, but in any case.<U+201D> He added that <U+201C>Guaranteed. Full stop. Nobody gets treated differently when it comes to the Justice Department, because nobody is above the law.<U+201D> If Donald Trump wins next Tuesday, one major reason will be that the meltdown at Justice has shown how manifestly false Mr. Obama<U+2019>s statements were.",

Marco Rubio. | AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais By Marc Caputo 10/20/16 08:33 PM EDT MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. <U+2014> President Barack Obama came to Sen. Marco Rubio<U+2019>s home turf Thursday to taunt him for supporting Donald Trump, who the senator trashed when he ran against his fellow Republican during the GOP primary campaign for president. <U+201C>How can you call him a <U+2018>con artist<U+2019> and <U+2018>dangerous<U+2019> and object to all the controversial things he says and then say, 'But I'm still gonna vote for him?' C'mon, man!\" Obama said as the crowd in Miami Gardens laughed. Story Continued Below <U+201C>It is the height of cynicism. That's the sign of somebody who will say anything, do anything, pretend to be anybody, just to get elected. And you know what? If you're willing to be anybody just to be somebody, then you don't have the leadership that Florida needs in the United States<U+2019> Senate,\" Obama said before urging the crowd to vote for Rubio<U+2019>s opponent, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy. Murphy desperately needs the help of the president. About two dozen Florida polls show Rubio beating Murphy while Hillary Clinton is leading Trump. Rubio, according to a recent Bendixen & Amandi International poll , is also tied with Murphy in Miami-Dade, Florida<U+2019>s most-populous county that<U+2019>s a stronghold for Democrats. If a Republican comes close to winning Miami-Dade, he generally wins statewide. Rubio<U+2019>s side is also overpowering Murphy<U+2019>s campaign on Florida<U+2019>s TV airwaves. Yet, despite Rubio's dominance over Murphy, a Quinnipiac University poll released this week found the U.S. Senate race too close to call. It found Murphy had closed a large gap and was only trailing Rubio by two percentage points. One of Murphy<U+2019>s biggest disadvantages is that he<U+2019>s not as well-known as Rubio, who has drawn national attention since joining the Senate in 2011 and running for president. Murphy was counting on the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Senate Majority super PAC to make good on their pledge to spend $20.8 million in TV ads for him. But Democrats withdrew more than $15 million in promised spending in Florida. Rubio<U+2019>s campaign responded with a thank you for the president. <U+201C>The Democrats cancel Murphy's funding and then 48 hours later, President Obama gives Marco's campaign a fundraising gift,<U+201D> said Rubio adviser Alex Conant. <U+201C>Obama's attacks will only energize Marco's supporters more.<U+201D> As Trump continues to struggle in Florida, Rubio has distanced himself from his one-time GOP White House rival. His top supporters say Rubio<U+2019>s lead is no sure thing. And that<U+2019>s where Obama comes in. The president also criticized Rubio for backing away from comprehensive immigration reform in 2013 and for refusing to support legislation to fight carbon emissions linked to global warming. <U+201C>Unlike his opponent, Patrick actually believes in science and believes in the effects of climate change,<U+201D> Obama said. <U+201C>Just the other night in their debate, Marco Rubio did not accept that sea levels are rising, and if you're watching TV or you are going down some of the blocks here in Miami, in the middle of a sunny day and you see the ocean coming up through the streets, how can you deny what is right in front of you?

        "input": "time: null \n author: Paul Hannon \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/oecd-says-trumps-policies-could-lift-global-growth-1480327202 \n text: U.S. and global economic growth would be boosted by increases in spending and tax cuts promised by President-elect Donald Trump, but those gains would be lost if he pressed ahead with threatened tariff increases that triggered retaliation, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Monday. During his campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to boost infrastructure spending by as much as $1 trillion, although the details of how that would be financed are sketchy. He has also promised to cut corporate and personal income taxes. In its twice-yearly report on global economic prospects, the Paris-based research body said that while the exact form it would take is uncertain, it does expect Mr. Trump to offer some fiscal stimulus from the early months of his presidency, and that its likely scale that would boost U.S. economic growth to 2.3% from 1.9% in 2017, and to 3% from 2.2% in 2018. There would also be benefits for other parts of the world as U.S. demand for imports rises, with global economic growth raised to 3.3% from 3.2% in 2017, and to 3.6% from 3.3% in 2018. The OECD is the first international economic policy agency to publish an estimate of the likely impact of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s proposals. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s now some prospect of the world exiting from this low-growth trap,<U+201D> said <U+00C1>ngel Gurria, the OECD<U+2019>s secretary-general. <U+201C>Even though we still show the signs of those very heavy legacies of the crisis, we may be at a moment where we could see a turn for the better.<U+201D> The OECD<U+2019>s forecasts are based on an increase in U.S. government spending in 2017 and 2018 of 0.25% of gross domestic product, a cut in income taxes that reduces government revenue by 0.5% of GDP in each year, and a cut in the corporate tax rate that reduces revenue by 0.75% of GDP in 2018. It calculates that thanks to the boost to growth, such a package would leave the government<U+2019>s debts slightly smaller as a share of economic output. The OECD, which gives policy advice to its 35 members, said other governments should also provide more fiscal stimulus than now planned, since that would further boost global growth. With the room for monetary policy initiatives that boost growth having been <U+201C>exhausted,<U+201D> the OECD has in recent years urged more investment spending by governments as a way out of what it calls the <U+201C>low-growth trap.<U+201D> <U+201C>The actions and proposals we have seen so far are not enough,<U+201D> said Mr. Gurria, who added the plans of most European governments <U+201C>are too timid.<U+201D> But it warned that a slide toward protectionism could offset the boost from higher government spending and lower taxes. In addition to his pledges on spending and taxation, Mr. Trump said he would introduce higher tariffs on imports from China and Mexico, and reassess other trade relationships that he said placed U.S. workers at a disadvantage. <U+201C>Protectionism and inevitable trade retaliation would offset much of the effects of the fiscal initiatives on domestic and global growth, raise prices, harm living standards, and leave countries in a worsened fiscal position,<U+201D> said Catherine Mann, the OECD<U+2019>s chief economist. The OECD estimates that for some of its members more than 25% of jobs depend on foreign demand. Rather than resort to trade barriers in an attempt to protect some jobs in the short term, the OECD said governments would do better to help those who have lost their jobs acquire new skills. <U+201C>Let<U+2019>s protect those who may be disadvantaged by the globalization process, but lets not stop the globalization process,<U+201D> said Mr. Gurria. Turning to the U.K., the OECD raised its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.2% from 1% in September, but said it expects the economy to slow further in 2018 to grow by just 1% as uncertainty about the terms of the country<U+2019>s departure from the European Union weakens business investment. Its forecasts are lower than those of the U.K.<U+2019>s Office for Budget Responsibility, which last week said it expects the economy to grow by 1.4% next year and 1.7% in 2018. In a budget update Wednesday,<U+00A0>U.K. Treasury chief Philip Hammond signaled a new course after almost a decade of belt-tightening, saying he expects billions in extra borrowing over the next few years to support the economy as it exits the EU. <U+201C>The latest government plans...indicate a slower pace of fiscal consolidation and some increase in public investment,<U+201D> the OECD said. <U+201C>A more significant increase in public investment would support demand in the near term and boost supply in the longer term.<U+201D> Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com",

By Annie Karni 10/19/16 05:04 AM EDT LAS VEGAS <U+2014> Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s favorite way to abuse a lead is to take her foot off the gas pedal and coast. This time, as the campaign confidently expands into red states with just three weeks to go, it<U+2019>s a tendency her team actually wants her to indulge in the final, bitter face-off against Donald Trump. The goal for Clinton, according to a longtime aide, is to make Trump <U+201C>shadowbox<U+201D> his way through the 90-minute session Wednesday night <U+2014> by keeping her head down and avoiding direct confrontation as he hurls personal and Wiki-related attacks in her direction. Story Continued Below <U+201C>She has control of this race,<U+201D> said Democratic strategist David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. <U+201C>She should stay within herself <U+2026> and resist the temptation to trade insults with Trump.<U+201D> Unlike at the previous two debates, the Clinton team is not making any pre-debate predictions that a kinder, gentler Trump might show up on the Las Vegas Strip for the final hurrah. Instead, they are raising expectations that the Republican, sensing nothing to lose, will throw every dirty punch possible. <U+201C>We are not expecting Trump to even try to seem presidential, and it would be too late even if he did,<U+201D> said Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon. <U+201C>She will be ready for whatever scorched-earth tactics he tries out. He clearly thinks he did well in the second debate <U+2014> but his mistake is thinking that rallying his core supporters is a winning strategy. He only further alienated persuadable voters.<U+201D> Foreign Policy By Nahal Toosi Clinton, meanwhile, is trying to use the last appearance before a multimillion-viewer audience to do something other than tussle with Trump. Her team is eager to see her land a few lines that convey an aspirational message in what<U+2019>s otherwise been the darkest presidential contest in modern American politics. <U+201C>Clinton should hammer away at Trump<U+2019>s unfitness, but priority one for this final debate is to make the compelling case for her candidacy,<U+201D> said Jonathan Cowan, a former Clinton White House aide who is now head of the centrist think tank Third Way. <U+201C>She has a shot at being the first Democrat in decades to win college-educated voters, and she must focus on closing that sale Wednesday night.<U+201D> Her team is, indeed, hoping to pick up those voters, especially any newly alienated conservatives eager to flee Trump. Clinton is not even staying overnight in Vegas, instead flying back to Chappaqua to begin the final 19-day sprint to Election Day. Indeed, if her goal is to keep a low profile on the stage Wednesday night, it<U+2019>s to raise it everywhere that matters in the following days. Over the next week, she plans to travel to major battlegrounds in which Trump was leading just a few short weeks ago; she will be in Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Florida in the next week. But first she has to get through the unpleasantness of the Chris Wallace-moderated showdown. Clinton operatives flying into Las Vegas on Tuesday said they expected the debate conversation to devolve beyond where it landed last week in St. Louis, where Trump used Bill Clinton as a human shield to defend himself against his own bragging about kissing and groping women without consent <U+2014> and invited three of the former president<U+2019>s accusers from the '90s to sit front row in the auditorium. (This time, Trump has invited Obama<U+2019>s half-brother, Malik Obama.) White House By Sarah Wheaton Clinton officials blame the brain trust of Breitbart executive Steve Bannon and veteran GOP operative David Bossie, both running Trump<U+2019>s strategy, for the tenor of the second debate <U+2014> they have convinced Trump to <U+201C>aggressively prosecute a set of 1990s-era attacks against the Clintons,<U+201D> Fallon said. <U+201C>But that is a strategy for a primary campaign, not a general.<U+201D> Since then, Trump has also accused Hillary Clinton of being on drugs before the second debate and said the two candidates should be submitted to a drug test before the final showdown. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t know what<U+2019>s going on with her,<U+201D> he told a crowd in New Hampshire. <U+201C>She was all pumped at the beginning, and at the end it was like, <U+2018>Oh, take me down.<U+2019> She could barely reach her car.<U+201D> It<U+2019>s not the kind of conversation Clinton<U+2019>s expert team of debate preppers was originally expecting in a tight general election. Speaking to reporters on board Clinton<U+2019>s plane to Las Vegas on Tuesday afternoon, Palmieri said that in the first two showdowns, <U+201C>there wasn't as much focus on policy as she would like because of how Donald Trump uses his time.<U+201D> And that has fundamentally shifted how Clinton goes about her marathon debate prep sessions. Back in March, Clinton was planning on peppering her debate against Bernie Sanders with some early Trump attack lines. By Kyle Cheney Clinton \"wanted some good Trump hits, and we've thought of the fact that he opposed the auto bailout, and Trump University,<U+201D> Clinton aide Sarah Solow emailed the debate prep team on March 4, ahead of one of Clinton<U+2019>s marathon prep sessions (the email was released on WikiLeaks, among thousands of hacked emails from campaign chairman John Podesta<U+2019>s personal account). But those were the more innocent days of early spring, when the Clinton campaign was still focused on the policy positions of the potential Republican nominee, which might hurt him with voters in the Rust Belt. Now the campaign is expecting more of the personal. And that prep work tends to happen in a smaller group of trusted aides. In a schedule for debate prep sent to her team by Ron Klain last spring, a portion titled <U+201C>review the sensitive WJC related questions<U+201D> was proposed for a smaller group only, liked a closed set (just Podesta, senior aide Jake Sullivan, debate prep leader Karen Dunn and longtime adviser Mandy Grunwald) in the privacy of Clinton<U+2019>s Chappaqua home. Progressives, meanwhile, are hoping that Clinton will assuage any fears that have recently popped up in the emails stolen from Podesta, released daily by WikiLeaks. Those emails included comments she gave behind closed doors to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms, and have raised questions among progressives about her commitment to causes championed by Sanders. <U+201C>It would be good politics and good policy for her to get more specific on some of the issues of the day when it comes to Wall Street,<U+201D> said Dan Cantor, national director of the Working Families Party. <U+201C>She should say she is for closing the CEO bonus loophole. She should really distinguish herself from this phony guy she<U+2019>s about to defeat.<U+201D> Added Democratic consultant Rebecca Katz, a former top adviser to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio: <U+201C>After the drip, drip of the Podesta emails, the left needs a shot in the arm. Clinton needs to say something meaningful to the Bernie voters and the 'maybe' voters that gets them to the polls.<U+201D> But other Democratic strategists said she should just shrug it all off and trudge on. <U+201C>I would just hold fast to the public positions she has taken,<U+201D> said Axelrod, <U+201C>and tell people what they mean for them.<U+201D> By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Daily Bell Staff \n source: thedailybell.com \n text: Trump and Brexit Defeat Globalism, for Now Anyway   14, 2016 \nTrumpism as a stress test for democracy <U+2026>. A series of populist anti-globalism shocks is a test for Western democracies. Trump<U+2019>s stunning ascent to the White House is the clearest signal yet of an anti-establishment revolt unfolding in major democracies, stretching across the Atlantic. <U+2013> Swiss Info Tech \nWas Trump<U+2019>s victory actually created by the very globalist elites that Trump is supposed to have overcome? \nThere are some who believe the elites are actually splintered into numerous groups and that domestic US elites have positioned themselves against the banking elites in London<U+2019>s City. We see no fundamental evidence of this. \nThe world<U+2019>s real elites in our view may have substantive histories in the hundreds and thousands of years. US elites are basically in the employ of a handful of families, individuals and institutions in our view. \nIt is confusing because it is hard to tell if Hillary, for instance, is operating on her own accord or at the behest of higher and more powerful authorities. \nIt is probably a combination of both but at root those who control central banks are managing the world<U+2019>s move towards globalism. History easily shows us who these groups are <U+2013> and they are not located in America. \nThis is a cynical perspective to be sure, and certainly doesn<U+2019>t remove the impact of Trump<U+2019>s victory or his courage in waging his election campaign despite what must surely be death threats to himself and his family.. \nBut if true, this perspective corresponds to predictions that we<U+2019>ve been making for nearly a decade now, suggesting that sooner or later elites <U+2013> especially those in London<U+2019>s City <U+2013> would have to <U+201C>take a step back.<U+201D> \nMore: \nThe vote to propel Trump to the US presidency reflects a profound backlash against open markets and borders, and the simmering anger of millions of blue-collar white and working-class people who blame their economic woes on globalisation and multiculturalism. \n<U+201C>There are a few parallels to Switzerland <U+2013> that the losers of globalisation find somebody who is listening to them,<U+201D> said Swiss professor and lawyer Wolf Linder, a former director of the University of Bern<U+2019>s political science institute. \n<U+201C>Trump is doing his business with the losers of globalisation in the US, like the Swiss People<U+2019>s Party is doing in Switzerland,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>It is a phenomenon which touches all European nations.<U+201D> \nAgain, this article presumes that Trump has <U+201C>won<U+201D> and that he intends to attack the larger globalist enterprise and the bankers funding it. On the other hand, it could be that both Trump and Brexit have been engineered to look as if the tide is turning against globalism when it is not. \nWhy would those in charge want to portray this point of view when it may not be so? Because of what we call the <U+201C>Internet Reformation<U+201D> that has blasted open the secretive manipulations of the globalist elite in the past decade or so. \nIt is almost impossible for globalists to promote internationalist memes in this environment. Yet it is the secretive injection of internationalist memes into the body politic that moves society toward the globalist enterprise. \nAs we have suggested before, it is perfectly possible that a decision has been made to pretend to grant the larger society a <U+201C>victory<U+201D> over internationalism. \nFollowing this analysis, certain trends would be identified and encouraged that would seem to portray globalism as falling back on its metaphorical heels. \nIn truth, if this analysis is correct, globalism<U+2019>s retreat is a kind of pretense that will steer society less obviously in a globalist direction. \nOne way this could happen is by ensuring the splintering of Europe <U+2013> but not in a way that actually reduces control from Brussels. It will APPEAR to be so but won<U+2019>t actually happen. The same thing could take place in the USA under Trump. \nAgain, this is not to say that Trump is party to this plot or even approves of it. But the idea that Trump is part of a co-option is certainly a feasible alternative to an alternative analysis that takes what is happening at face value. \nNonetheless, even if an alternative elite strategy has been decided on to realize globalism in another fashion, it ought to be pointed out that things have changed. And the Internet and its revelations are surely responsible. \nThis is a very big deal and it is one that ought to be emphasized repeatedly. Brexit and Trump could be, somehow, the result of a different elite approach <U+2013> but the approach HAS changed nonetheless. \nThink of it this way: Hillary represented the blunt approach toward the realization of further globalism. Her way included an aggressively expanded war and the pursuit of other globalist trends. \nTrump, rhetorically anyway, has a different approach in mind that would gut many internationalist trends. \nIf Trump follows through on his rhetoric, the trend toward an internationalist world will be reduced. And while there is controversy over Trump<U+2019>s recent staff appointments we should also bear in mind that the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) both seem to be failing now. \nIf indeed Trump<U+2019>s election has damped the progress of TPP, and TTIP, this is a huge event. As we<U+2019>ve pointed out, both agreements effectively substituted technocratic corporatism for the current sociopolitical model of <U+201C>democracy.<U+201D> \nThe elites were trying to move toward a new model of world control with these two agreements. This is similar to what happened after the advent of the Gutenberg Press when the elites of the day moved away from royal control and apparently swapped in democracy. \nIt seems evident that internationalism is now going to take a longer time to realize than we thought. However, this observation may not be entirely accurate if Trump turns out to be something other than his rhetoric suggests <U+2013> or if Brexit is denied in Europe. \nAdditionally, one of the elite<U+2019>s most powerful, operative memes today is <U+201C>populism vs. globalism<U+201D> that seeks to contrast the potentially freedom-oriented events of Trump and Brexit to the discarded wisdom of globalism. See here and here. \nThe reality of these two events, the victories of both Trump and Brexit, stand as signal proof that elite stratagems have been defeated, at least temporarily. Though whether these defeats have been self-inflicted as part of a change in tactics remains to be seen. \nConclusion: But the change has come. One way or another the Internet and tens of millions or people talking, writing and acting has forced new trends. This can be hardly be emphasized enough. Globalism has been at least temporarily redirected",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Zero Hedge \n source: thedailysheeple.com \n text: \nIf you<U+2019>re following the news, you know FBI Director James Comey announced that the FBI found a bunch of emails on Anthony Weiner<U+2019>s laptop.\nAs Dilbert Creator Scott Adams notes, there appears to be two main observations:\n1. Comey seemed pro-Clinton when he dropped the initial email case.\n2. Comey seems anti-Clinton this week because he announced a new round of investigations right before the election.\nSo, how can both behaviors be explained? \nFirst some background from Adams on <U+2018>The Persuasion Filter<U+2019> :\nAs my regular readers know, the Persuasion Filter is related to the idea that the human brain never evolved to accurately comprehend reality . In order for us to be here today, our predecessors only needed to survive and procreate. They had no need to understand reality at any basic level. And we have no such need either. That<U+2019>s why you might believe you are reincarnated from a monk and I might believe my prophet flew to heaven on a winged horse but we can both get through the day just fine. Many different interpretations of reality are good enough for survival. I like to describe reality as each person living their own movie, which works well unless our script<U+2019>s conflict. When that happens, one of us goes into cognitive dissonance and rewrites our past to make the movies consistent. \nThat<U+2019>s how I see the world.\nLast year in this blog I suggested that the most productive and predictive way to view reality is through what I call the Persuasion Filter. That<U+2019>s what I have been using to make spooky-good predictions about the election so far. And that<U+2019>s what I<U+2019>ll use today to give you an alternate movie about James Comey. Compare it to the movie you are running in your head and see which one better predicts the future.\nThe base assumption of the Persuasion Filter is that people are irrational 90% of the time and only rarely <U+2013> when no emotions are involved <U+2013> truly rational. This is the reverse of the common filter for reality, in which people are assumed to be rational 90% of the time and a bit crazy 10% of the time. That<U+2019>s some background for context.\nRead more here<U+2026> \nSo, back to Comey, Adams asks <U+2013> which movie does the best job of explaining our observations and also predicting the future? \nSome say Comey is a political pawn in a rigged system. By that movie script we can explain why he dropped the initial email case. But we can<U+2019>t explain why he<U+2019>s acting against Clinton<U+2019>s interests now. What changed?\nWell, some say Comey had to reopen the case against Clinton after discovering the Weiner laptop emails. If he failed to act, there might be a revolt at the FBI and maybe a whistleblower would come forward . But that leaves unexplained why Comey detailed to Congress how Clinton appeared to be guilty of crimes at the same time he said the FBI was dropping the case. If Comey had been protecting Clinton on the first round, he would have softened his description of her misdeeds, wouldn<U+2019>t he? But he didn<U+2019>t seem to hold back anything.\nAnd none of those hypotheses explain why the people who know Comey have high regard for his integrity. Comey also has the security of a 10-year appointment as Director, so he has a low chance of getting fired or politically influenced. That<U+2019>s exactly why the job has a 10-year term. Given what we know of Comey before any of the Clinton emails, any movie that casts Comey as an ass-covering weasel is probably making a casting mistake.\nSo allow me to offer an interpretation of events that casts Comey as more of a patriot and hero than an ass-covering weasel. Compare my interpretation with whatever movie you have in your head and see which one works best for explaining and predicting.\nMy movie says Comey had good evidence against Clinton during the initial investigation but made a judgement call to leave the decision to the American public . For reasons of conscience, and acting as a patriot, Comey explained in clear language to the public exactly what evidence the FBI found against Clinton. The evidence looked damning because it was. Under this interpretation, Comey took a bullet to his reputation for the sake of the Republic. He didn<U+2019>t want the FBI to steal this important decision away from the people, but at the same time he couldn<U+2019>t let the people decide blind. So he divulged the evidence and stepped away, like the action hero who doesn<U+2019>t look back at the explosion. \nIn the second act of this movie, Comey learns that the Weiner laptop had emails that were so damning it would be a crime against the public to allow them to vote without first seeing a big red flag. And a flag was the best he could do because it was too early in the investigation to leak out bits and pieces of the evidence. That would violate Clinton<U+2019>s rights.\nBut Comey couldn<U+2019>t easily raise a red flag to warn the public because it was against FBI policy to announce a criminal investigation about a candidate so close to election day. So Comey had a choice of either taking another bullet for the Republic or screwing the very country that he has spent his career protecting. \nIn this movie, Comey did the hero thing. He alerted the public to the fact that the FBI found DISQUALIFYING information on the Weiner laptop. And he took a second bullet to his reputation. \nHow do I know the new emails are that bad? \nI start by assuming Comey is the same man now as the one who was carefully vetted before being hired to protect the integrity of one of our most important institutions. And even Comey<U+2019>s critics concede he<U+2019>s smart. \nSo<U+2026>\nThe way you know the new emails are disqualifying for Clinton is because otherwise our hero would have privately informed Congress and honored the tradition of not influencing elections. Comey is smart enough to know his options. And unless he suddenly turned rotten at his current age, he<U+2019>s got the character to jump in front of a second bullet for the Republic.\nAccording to this movie, no matter who gets elected, we<U+2019>ll eventually learn of something disqualifying in the Weiner emails.\nAnd we can<U+2019>t say we weren<U+2019>t warned. Comey took two bullets to do it. \nSo compare this movie to your own movie and see which one does the best job of explaining the observed facts. And when we find out what is in the Weiner laptop emails, compare that news to my prediction that the information is disqualifying.\nThe Persuasion Filter says there is no preferred reality. We all see our own movies. In my movie, Comey<U+2019>s has a consistent personality from start to finish. He starts out his career as a smart, competent patriot and he later proves it by taking two bullets for the Republic. If your movie script has Comey suddenly changing his basic character for this election season, don<U+2019>t expect an Oscar. \nRead more here<U+2026> \nOf course if you<U+2019>re a Democrat, this is all irrelevant and Comey is <U+201C>A Putin puppet<U+201D> (Howard Dean), <U+201C>a federal law-breaker who should never have been appointed<U+201D> (Harry Reid), and <U+201C>a partisan, prejudiced individual<U+201D> (Eric Holder)<U+2026>\nNEW: Former Attorney General Holder, dozens of other former DOJ officials pen letter criticizing FBI director Comey. https://t.co/aXmWvAiFMg pic.twitter.com/FskFeDpoyE \n<U+2014> ABC News (@ABC) October 31, 2016 \n\nYou decide which makes more sense <U+2013> Scott Adams<U+2019> <U+201C>movie<U+201D> or the real partisan hacks above?

No one has been as helpful to Maliki as the Kurdish nation, Kurdistan<U+2019>s political parties, especially the KDP,<U+201D> the party said in a statement. \nThe KDP, whose leader is Masoud Barzani, compared Maliki to one of Saddam Hussein<U+2019>s most notorious henchmen. <U+201C>The disloyalty he has shown and the crimes he has committed against the Kurdish nation are no lesser than the crimes of Ali Hasan al-Majid (chemical Ali). He was the indulged son of the US at some point, yet disloyal to them now,<U+201D> the KDP statement added, referring to Maliki<U+2019>s cooperation with US forces in the past. \nIn an interview with Euronews aired Wednesday, Maliki lashed out at Barzani, accusing him of implementing Israel<U+2019>s policy in the region, claiming, <U+201C>Kurdistan will become the second Palestine in the future,<U+201D> and adding that <U+201C>Israeli sympathizers and elements are abundant in Kurdistan.<U+201D> \nMaliki, who is the secretary general of the Daawa Party and head of the State of Law Faction in parliament, slammed Barzani, saying the, <U+201C>Kurdistan Region has become a strategic and developed platform for the implementation of the US-Israeli policy, and by Kurdistan I do not mean all the Kurds.

He is not happy to see the unprecedented coordination between the Peshmerga and the Iraqi Army which are fighting terrorism together, liberating the areas which his coward army gave to ISIS. Maliki is unhappy to see that the Peshmerga and the Iraqi forces are successful in fighting terror. He is just like the wounded bear that bites its wounds out of pain and desperation.<U+201D> \nThe KDP said, <U+201C>We want to reassure him (Maliki) that Kurdistan<U+2019>s borders are not the ones determined by Saddam Hussein and Maliki.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Eddy Lavine \n source: worldtruth.tv \n text: posted by Eddie Ever wonder how cellphones went from being a point of wealth to household commodity? Well, there<U+2019>s reason to believe that the accessibility of cellphones isn<U+2019>t purely coincidental. The thought originated with metadata and the possibilities made possible through the documentation of information that cellphones provide, through both backdoor access and the location data each phone provides. FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, is an incredibly secret court that answers to no one and, has autonomy in not only their proceeding and rulings, but, is also highly-classified. Through this system, President<U+2019>s George Bush and Barrack Obama have enabled their own domestic surveillance practices. Although, The NSA is heavily involved as well. In doing so, the government has created programs and jobs that are specific to collecting and translating meta-data. The government would have you believe that meta-data is not as invasive as specific data, but, let<U+2019>s consider it this way. Imagine your coordinates being reported by the second, from the time you wake in the morning, during your commute to work, and whichever plans you have afterwards. This data system gives insight into each particular location, phone call, and the duration of said phone calls to these data collectors. Imagine being able to see each and every step your better half or child has throughout the day, and you notice they stops at location that seem unusual or speak/communicate with numbers/people unfamiliar to you while having access to the duration of those calls. Although, this leaves an opportunity for misconception, but, it also brings us to an objective truth, how revealing metadata can be. Edward Snowden, a former NSA employer who specialized in technology in the cyber division, released classified documents involving both government programs that enacted policies, and, FISA court rulings on said programs. These revelations brought his need to flee for asylum in China, and then and currently, Russia. Snowden<U+2019>s attempt of transparency let Americans learn just how much census data has changed and the contracts deployed between the government and the major communications companies, such as AT&T. These companies have made millions by granting backdoor access and data to the government. Yet, this isn<U+2019>t all bad. Local officials have occasionally solicited access, through communication companies, to find criminals and perpetrators of crime.

In the past week, Mr. Zuckerberg has defended Facebook against claims that fake news on the site distorted public discourse about the U.S. presidential election. Two days after the election, Mr. Zuckerberg said that the notion that Facebook helped tip the election in favor of Donald Trump was <U+201C>a pretty crazy idea.<U+201D> In a lengthy post last weekend, Mr. Zuckerberg played down the prevalence of fake news on the site<U+2014>accounting for less than 1% of global content<U+2014>and said that Facebook<U+2019>s role isn<U+2019>t to be <U+201C>arbiters of truth.<U+201D> On Friday, Mr. Zuckerberg reiterated that misinformation is a small part of Facebook content, but that it takes this problem seriously. Mr. Zuckerberg said the disclosure about the steps was unusual for Facebook because it doesn<U+2019>t share specifics about works in progress. The first and most important step is to rely on technology to better classify misinformation and <U+201C>detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves,<U+201D> Mr. Zuckerberg said. Another step is to make it easier for users to report fake stories, he said. Facebook has long relied on users to flag objectionable content, including fake news. Facebook is turning to outside groups for help in fact-checking, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote.<U+00A0>It is also exploring a product that would label stories as false if they have been flagged as such by third-parties or users, and then show warnings to users who read or share the articles. Facebook earlier this week announced it would bar fake-news sites from using the company<U+2019>s ad-selling tools . Mr. Zuckerberg said he is looking into <U+201C>disrupting the economics<U+201D> of sites that traffic in fake information.

Now, it sems that NASA is making good on his promise and is moving forward with the plan by establishing a Deep-Space Habitat near the Moon to test out systems for people who would live in orbit or travel long distances in Space; a gateway to deep space NASA plans to address its problem by parking a <U+201C>deep space<U+201D> habitat in a location near the Moon, which astronauts could visit and use to become acclimated to life beyond low-Earth orbit. President Obama mentioned deep space habitats earlier this month, when he reiterated his call for NASA to send humans to Mars. <U+201C>I'm excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space,<U+201D> Obama said. This wasn<U+2019>t really a new announcement, as NASA has been working on the habitat program for a couple of years. Nevertheless, before the president's mention, this NextSTEP program had received surprisingly little attention given its significance<U+2014>it might be the most important contract NASA awards for next decade. As Obama said, NASA has embarked upon a \"Journey to Mars.\" While the plan may change to include lunar landings as a stepping stone to Mars, the space agency does intend to try and venture back into deep space for the first time since the Apollo program. Whatever destination it chooses, NASA's ambitions will begin with the deep space habitat, because it is an affordable first step, costing hundreds of millions or a few billion dollars initially, instead of multiple billions needed for a full-blown expedition to the Moon's surface, Mars or elsewhere in deep space. \"This is the right next step,\" Simon said. \"We need to understand how to live in deep space, how to live off of our planet.\" The first habitat launched in the 2020s won<U+2019>t be exactly the same as the vehicle NASA eventually sends to Mars. Rather, it will serve as a prototype to help the space agency understand the capabilities, technologies, and systems needed for astronauts to survive for long periods in deep space. Some of those systems can be tested on the ground or the existing space station, but others can only be tested further from Earth. This venture is part of the Next step program initiated by NASA: www.nasa.gov... NextSTEP is a public-private partnership model that seeks commercial development of deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human space flight missions in the Proving Ground around and beyond cislunar space<U+2014>the space near Earth that extends just beyond the moon.

Mountain Posted on October 27, 2016 by Thomas C. Mountain \nThe small east African nation of Eritrea has implemented the Mother Tongue policy nationwide to prevent cultural genocide within its nine different ethnic groups. \nThis is done by educating all children in tribal environments in their mother tongue until literacy at grade 5. By making sure that the ethnic minorities learn to read and write in their mother tongue the Eritrean Government is making sure that their culture survives as well, for without one<U+2019>s language one cannot practice your culture. \nHistorically destroying peoples mother tongue is the means used to carry out a policy of cultural genocide with many thousands of dialects having disappeared during the Western colonial and neo colonial era. Today many of the languages that remain are threatened by the children of these ethnic groups not being literate in their mother tongue which will almost inevitably lead to the loss of their identity, their language and their culture. \nIt has not been easy for Eritrea, hammered by global warming, drought, sand, economically disadvantaged due to Western inflicted sanctions and embargoes and with 9 tribes with 9 languages, some of which have never had a written language, the challenge of implementing the Mother Tongue policy for all our tribes has been hard work. \nIt has been well over a decade now that the policy has become the practice nationwide and the next generation of Eritrean youth from all our 9 tribes are literate in their mother tongue, a policy the whole world needs to adopt. \nThomas C.

        "input": "time: null \n author: ADAM LIPTAK \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/us/politics/trump-supreme-court.html?_r=0 \n text: WASHINGTON <U+2014> The election of Donald J. Trump means that Justice Antonin Scalia<U+2019>s seat, vacant since he died in February, will almost certainly be filled by a conservative nominee. Back to full strength, the court will again tilt right , as it has for decades. And with the court<U+2019>s two senior liberal members fairly old, that may be only the start. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83, and Justice Stephen G. Breyer is 78. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s surprising triumph vindicates Republican senators, who refused to act on President Obama<U+2019>s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland , saying the choice of a new Supreme Court justice should belong to the next president. It now belongs to Mr. Trump. <U+201C>Senate Republicans<U+2019> strategy of not even considering Garland, of letting the American people decide who gets to fill Scalia<U+2019>s seat, worked,<U+201D> said Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer with the Cato Institute, a libertarian group. <U+201C>Not only that, but it didn<U+2019>t at all hurt vulnerable senators running for re-election.<U+201D> But some liberals said they hoped that even a Supreme Court dominated by conservative justices, including ones on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s list of 21 possible nominees vetted by conservative legal groups, could serve as a restraint on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s ambitions. <U+201C>Given that many of the conservatives on his list are more in the traditional conservative mold than Trump himself, they might not simply write him a blank check when it comes to actions and policies that threaten constitutional structure,<U+201D> said Elizabeth Wydra, the president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. <U+201C>As is the case during every administration of either party, the court will inevitably be asked to step in and serve the judicial branch<U+2019>s role as a check on the political branches.<U+201D> In the short term, the court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. is poised to return to the status quo: closely divided, leaning right, with the crucial vote belonging to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. <U+201C>He may have been the biggest winner last night,<U+201D> Mr. Shapiro said of Justice Kennedy. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election represents a lost opportunity for liberals, and they are fearful of what comes next at the Supreme Court. <U+201C>On the brink of having the first liberal-leaning Supreme Court in decades, the judicial left has now been banished to the wilderness for perhaps decades more,<U+201D> said Barry Friedman, a law professor at New York University. <U+201C>It is difficult seeing a path to anything other than a yet more conservative court for the imaginable future.<U+201D> The balance of power at the Supreme Court could truly shift if there is a second vacancy while Mr. Trump is president. That appears entirely possible. Justice Ginsburg, who was harshly critical of Mr. Trump and seemed to predict a victory for Hillary Clinton, will face second-guessing over her decision to stay on the court rather than let Mr. Obama try to appoint her successor. Other retirements are possible, too. Justice Kennedy, the member of the court at its ideological center, is 80. <U+201C>In the worst case, we end up with a 7-2 conservative court, and a relatively young one at that,<U+201D> Professor Friedman said. <U+201C>This could be a typhoon for the Supreme Court. An already very conservative jurisprudence will deepen and may broaden, encompassing areas that had long been resistant, such as abortion rights.<U+201D> For now, abortion rights appear secure. In June, the court struck down a restrictive Texas abortion law by a 5-to-3 vote, with Justice Kennedy joining the court<U+2019>s four-member liberal wing. A new justice opposed to abortion rights would tighten that tally but not tip it. Similarly, affirmative action seems safe in the short term. In June, the court upheld a race-conscious admissions program at the University of Texas by a 4-to-3 vote. Justice Elena Kagan was recused but would almost certainly have voted with the majority, making the effective vote 5 to 3. Here again, a single Trump appointment would not change things. But a second Trump appointment is another matter, said Lee Epstein, a law professor and political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. <U+201C>We could see dramatic legal change,<U+201D> she said, <U+201C>with the recent affirmative action and abortion cases on the chopping block.<U+201D> Other areas of the law could be subject to faster change after a single Trump appointment. A threat to public-sector unions that ended in a deadlock in March, for instance, could soon reach the court again. This time, the challengers are likely to gain a fifth vote. The last term<U+2019>s other major deadlock , over Mr. Obama<U+2019>s plan to spare millions of unauthorized immigrants from deportation and allow them to work legally in the United States, will almost certainly be resolved without court intervention; Mr. Trump has vowed to take a different path on immigration. He is also likely to use his executive authority to undo the Obama administration<U+2019>s approach to climate change, transgender rights and clashes between religious beliefs and contraception coverage, again effectively pulling the plug on pending challenges in the courts. The Supreme Court decides about 70 cases a year, reviewing only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of lawsuits and prosecutions filed in federal courts. The lower federal courts are for now dominated by Democratic appointees, and the vast majority of their decisions escape Supreme Court review. In the short term, that leaves plenty of room for significant and lasting liberal victories in the lower federal courts. But the compositions of those courts will start to change, too, as Mr. Trump appoints judges to them. If his list of potential Supreme Court nominees is any guide, his lower-court appointments will also pull the law to the right. In the meantime, the replacement of Justice Scalia with another conservative would return the Supreme Court to a familiar dynamic, said Ms. Wydra of the Constitutional Accountability Center. <U+201C>That means conservative legal activists will once again be able to attempt aggressive changes that push the law even further to the right,<U+201D> she said, <U+201C>but there will still be the potential for more progressive rulings like the marriage equality and abortion rulings we saw from the court even with Scalia.<U+201D> Almost all of the candidates on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s list of potential nominees are sitting judges, and several served as law clerks to conservative Supreme Court justices. Many have judicial track records hostile to federal power, abortion rights and same-sex marriage . By training and temperament, judges move more slowly than politicians, and they have different values. <U+201C>An open question is what happens when Trump realizes that the sorts of judges he<U+2019>s been advised to appoint would rule against him on various matters,<U+201D> said Mr. Shapiro of the Cato Institute.

Twenty-two percent of Republicans say Pence is their No. 1 choice to be the next GOP nominee if Hillary Clinton knocks off Trump in November. Pence is beating Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump himself by nine percentage points, according to a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll of 1,989 registered voters this week. Twelve percent of Republicans polled said they<U+2019>d like to see Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) run again, 11 percent favor Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and just 7 percent are holding out hope Ohio Gov. John Kasich mounts another bid. Story Continued Below Pence<U+2019>s meteoric rise in the eyes of Republicans comes after he notched a convincing victory in the only vice presidential debate Tuesday night at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. Thirty-eight percent of voters said he beat Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, while just 20 percent said Kaine won. Pence<U+2019>s favorable ratings shot up seven percentage points, as well. But Pence did Trump no favors: An astounding 84 percent said the 90-minute tit-for-tat would not change their vote. \"Even though the VP debate had about half the audience of the presidential debate, both Mike Pence and Tim Kaine have seen their name recognition go up significantly,\" said Morning Consult co-founder and Chief Research Officer Kyle Dropp. \"The news is much better for Pence, though. Not only do more voters think he won the debate, his favorability now sits 10 points higher than Kaine's.\" Voters were split on moderator Elaine Quijano<U+2019>s performance, with 13 percent saying she did an <U+201C>excellent<U+201D> and 29 percent saying she did a <U+201C>good<U+201D> job. Thirty-three percent said her performance was <U+201C>only fair,<U+201D> and 21 percent said it was <U+201C>poor.<U+201D> Republicans were somewhat more likely to have a negative assessment. Pence<U+2019>s rise comes just one month before Election Day, and as Clinton and Kaine continue to take a commanding lead in a broad range of national polling. Trump will have the chance for a course correction, of sorts, on Sunday night during a town-hall debate at Washington University in St. Louis. Despite the Beltway narrative that voters would prefer Kaine and Pence to be atop the ticket, the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows it<U+2019>s a fantasy: Fifty-nine percent say they prefer Trump atop the ticket to Pence, and 84 percent say they want Clinton as the nominee, and not Kaine. That<U+2019>s not to say either Trump or Clinton is particularly popular. A shockingly high number of voters agree with Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who recently said neither Trump nor Clinton is a role model for children. One in three say Clinton is a role model, and 17 percent say Trump is a role model for America<U+2019>s youth. Fifty-six percent of Republicans say Trump is not a role model for kids. As Democrats look ahead to their 2020 choices, there is a far and away favorite if Clinton loses: 28 percent say Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren should top the ticket. The poll was conducted online from Oct. 5-6, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

Church bells rang out in the town on the southeastern approaches to Mosul where Iraqi troops, backed by U.S.-led air and ground forces, have been driving back the Sunni Muslim jihadists ahead of a battle for the city itself. \"Today Qaraqosh is free of Daesh (Islamic State),\" Syriac Catholic Archbishop of Mosul Butrus Moshe told worshippers. Islamic State has targeted the adherents and religious sites of minority communities in both Iraq and Syria. When it seized control of Mosul two years ago it issued an ultimatum to Christians: pay a tax, convert to Islam, or die by the sword. \nREAD MORE: ANCIENT NINEVAH CHRISTIANS FEAR ISIS IN RETURN HOME \nMost abandoned their homes and fled toward the autonomous Kurdish region, abandoning one of Christianity's earliest centers. \n\"Our role today is to remove all the remnants of Daesh,\" the archbishop said. \"This includes erasing sedition, separation and conflicts, which victimized us,\" said the archbishop, who was born in Qaraqosh. \n\"Political and sectarian strife, separating between one man and another, between ruler and follower, these mentalities must be changed,<U+201D> he said. \nChristianity in northern Iraq dates back to the first century AD. The number of Christians fell sharply during the violence which followed the 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein, and the Islamic State takeover of Mosul two years ago purged the city of Christians for the first time in two millennia. \nIt was from a Mosul mosque that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a \"caliphate\" in 2014, spanning northern Iraq and eastern Syria. The recapture of the city would mark the effective defeat of the Iraqi wing of that domain. \nReuters contribution by Mahdi Talat ; Writing by Bushra Shakshir and Stephen Kalin; Editing by Dominic Evans) Article by Doc Burkhart , Vice-President, General Manager and co-host of TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles Got a news tip?

What is that loud <U+201C>p-s-s-s-t<U+201D> noise that we hear wherever we go? Not to worry. It is just the air rushing out of Donald Trump<U+2019>s balloon. Story Continued Below A balloon filled with hot air usually rises. But when you have a giant baby sitting on top of that balloon, kicking his legs while he blubbers about how life is rigged against him, that bag and that candidate are heading nowhere. Which is where Trump is heading. Here are four things he should think about on the way, just because I<U+2019>ve always wanted to make a list of four things: 1. Always be closing. Donald Trump lurching along the tarmac, from his jet to his limo to his podium, is not a closing argument for voters. It is just a bunch of unrelated thoughts coming from a fevered mind. So his campaign needs closers to do the job for him. Closers like Rudy Giuliani, a man so venomous that rattlesnakes have been known to grow ill after biting him. By Kelsey Sutton <U+201C>I<U+2019>d rather have a genius like Donald Trump running this country than someone like Hillary Clinton,<U+201D> Giuliani said on <U+201C>Meet the Press<U+201D> a few weeks ago. In fairness, to Giuliani a head of cabbage is a genius. But most people have higher standards. And most people lift the bar for the presidency a little higher. Unfortunately for Trump, his opponent, Clinton, has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to closers. She has Michelle Obama, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton just to name the Big Three. After that she has Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden. I<U+2019>m not sure any of them calls Clinton a genius. They just say she knows important stuff <U+2014> like the date of Election Day. In 37 states and the District of Columbia, you can vote right now without giving a reason. On Election Day, Nov. 8, you can cast a regular ballot. Or you can wait until Incredible Election Day, which is Nov. 28. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re doing something that<U+2019>s incredible, it<U+2019>s a movement,<U+201D> Trump told a crowd in Panama City, Florida, on Oct. 11. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s never been anything like this, so go and register, make sure you get out and vote Nov. 28.<U+201D> You can try that. It<U+2019>s 20 days too late to actually vote, but you can bang on the doors at your polling place and tell them you want the Trump Incredible Special, which is a ballot between two pieces of white bread. 2016 By Eli Stokols The good news is that on Incredible Election Day, you won<U+2019>t find long lines. The bad news is that your vote will not be counted. Which actually is good news. 2. It<U+2019>s OK to play an audience like a violin. On Sunday, President Obama rolled up the sleeves of his open-neck blue shirt and delivered a closing speech for Hillary Clinton at a North Las Vegas high school. <U+201C>You<U+2019>ve got an ace and you<U+2019>ve got a jack,<U+201D> Obama boomed to the clamorous crowd. <U+201C>But you<U+2019>ve got to make sure to turn over the card by voting! This game didn<U+2019>t start on Nov. 8! The game ends on Nov. 8!<U+201D> Say what you want about Obama. He has not been a perfect president. He has not gotten all our troops out of Afghanistan or Iraq. Guant<U+00E1>namo is still open. And reversing the effects of climate change is still a few years off. But the guy knows the correct date of the election. And he knows how to turn a rip-roaring speech into a speech that chokes everybody up. <U+201C>I was here in Nevada in the closing days of both my campaigns <U+2014> both times you guys came through. I turned over that card and it was an ace,<U+201D> Obama said as the crowd shouted its approval. <U+201C>And Michelle and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts for all the support and all the prayers these past eight years.<U+201D> The crowd grew quieter now. <U+201C>It has been such a privilege to serve you,<U+201D> Obama said. <U+201C>But we<U+2019>ve got to make the right choice. Progress is on the ballot. Civility is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Equality is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. <U+201C>My name is not on the ballot ... <U+201D> Foreign Policy By Nahal Toosi Boos filled the air, but Obama quieted the crowd. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s all right; that<U+2019>s all right,<U+201D> he said. Hillary<U+2019>s name is on the ballot, he said, and she will work hard for them if they will work hard for her by making a few more phone calls and knocking on a few more doors. <U+201C>We will elect Hillary Clinton to be the next president of the United States,<U+201D> Obama said. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ll show our kids that we are still the greatest nation on Earth. And we<U+2019>re just going to keep on getting better because of you.<U+201D> And with lumps in their throats, the audience applauded on and on. 3. You can end with a bang. Elizabeth Warren ripped Donald Trump up and down on Monday, <U+201C>Donald Trump thinks because he has a mouth full of Tic Tacs he can force himself on any woman in groping distance,<U+201D> Warren said. <U+201C>Well, I<U+2019>ve got news for you, Mr. Trump: Women have had it with guys like you!<U+201D> 4. Or you can end with a whimper. On Monday, Trump held a roundtable discussion in Boynton Beach, Florida. <U+201C>I actually think we<U+2019>re winning,<U+201D> he told the group. It<U+2019>s possible. They have Walt Disney World in Florida. And Trump may have wandered into Fantasyland and can<U+2019>t find his way out. Roger Simon is POLITICO's chief political columnist.

Trump said last week. His surrogates called him <U+201C>a genius<U+201D> for his recently revealed tax avoidance strategies. Well, if they are right, the executives running corporate America are absolute virtuosos. An exhaustive study being released on Tuesday by a group of researchers shows in detail how Fortune 500 companies have managed to shelter trillions of dollars in profits offshore from being taxed. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s efforts pale by comparison. Worse, the companies have managed to hide many of their tax havens completely, in many cases reporting different numbers to different government agencies to obfuscate exactly how they<U+2019>ve avoided Uncle Sam. And, yes, it is all legal. The immediate response from many readers may be ire for the companies avoiding taxes <U+2014> or for Mr. Trump. But that<U+2019>s not the goal of this particular column. In this case, that kind of thinking may even be counterproductive. Instead, the study <U+2014> which notes that 58 Fortune 500 companies would owe $212 billion in additional federal taxes, <U+201C>equal to the entire state budgets of California, Virginia and Indiana combined,<U+201D> if they were taxed properly <U+2014> should be a five-alarm call to voters and lawmakers to finally fix the tax system. If all the attention on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s tax bill (or lack of one) isn<U+2019>t enough to inspire a complete rewrite of the tax code, this study may be. The authors of the report, which include the U.S. PIRG Education Fund and Citizens f or Tax Justice , combed through the filings of the Fortune 500 for 2015 and found an astonishing 73 percent <U+201C>maintained subsidiaries in offshore tax havens.<U+201D> Maybe it is to be expected. Companies and individuals complain bitterly that taxes are too high and the rules too complicated, but many corporations and the wealthiest members of our society have found ways to make the tax code work for them. If all the Fortune 500 companies paid taxes on their sheltered profits, the researchers tallied, the government would receive a whopping $717.8 billion windfall. To put that number in context, the 2015 federal budget deficit was $438 billion. However, fixing our corporate tax system alone isn<U+2019>t the answer to reducing our red ink; it might only be a drop in the bucket given that our total federal debt is nearing $20 trillion. The researchers reported that Apple holds $214.9 billion offshore and would owe $65.4 billion in taxes if that money came back to the United States; Nike holds $10.7 billion offshore and would owe $3.6 billion in United States taxes; Goldman Sachs holds $28.6 billion offshore, and the report says the company <U+201C>reports having 987 subsidiaries in offshore tax havens, 537 of which are in the Cayman Islands despite not operating a single legitimate office in that country, according to its own website.<U+201D> Rather than moralize about whether it is patriotic to pay taxes <U+2014> which seems to be a rather polarizing question these days <U+2014> let<U+2019>s focus on understanding exactly how companies keep money offshore and find an appealing way to bring back that money to help spur our economy and create jobs for those without them and higher incomes for those who do. It is worth noting that Apple<U+2019>s recent $14.5 billion tax bill levied by the European Union, which contended that Ireland undertaxed the company, is a good example of money kept offshore to benefit from lower rates. Perhaps it is a twist of irony, but given the European Union<U+2019>s efforts to collect <U+2014> which Apple<U+2019>s chief executive, Tim Cook, called <U+201C>total political crap<U+201D> <U+2014> one question that has emerged is whether United States companies may be more inclined to bring money back home rather than risk shifting tax rules in Europe (think Brexit, for example) and elsewhere. Perhaps not surprisingly, it<U+2019>s hard to figure out exact numbers for money stored abroad because there is so little transparency in how offshore profits are reported. So, the first element of making a better tax system is simply creating a more transparent way to report offshore profits so policy makers aren<U+2019>t in an information vacuum. Here<U+2019>s just one example of the problem: The Securities and Exchange Commission <U+201C>only requires that companies report all <U+2018>significant<U+2019> subsidiaries, based on multiple measures of a subsidiary<U+2019>s share of the company<U+2019>s total assets. By only requiring significant rather than all subsidiaries, this allows companies to get away with not disclosing many of their offshore subsidiaries and creates the potential for gaming because avoiding disclosure simply requires splitting a significant subsidiary into several smaller subsidiaries,<U+201D> the report says. It also points out that <U+201C>the penalties for not disclosing subsidiaries are so light<U+201D> that it is very likely that companies choose to muddle the numbers and consider the potential for being fined simply the cost of doing business. The challenge of transparency is exemplified by this finding: <U+201C>27 companies reported 16,389 total subsidiaries and 2,836 tax haven subsidiaries to the Federal Reserve, while only reporting 2,279 total subsidiaries and only 410 tax haven subsidiaries to the S.E.C.<U+201D> How is that possible? It isn<U+2019>t because these companies are lying to the S.E.C. (at least, not that we know about). It is because the S.E.C. has been so vague about the definitions of a subsidiary that it<U+2019>s almost laughable. All agencies should require the same definitions; the Federal Reserve, for example, is much tougher. Once we have the actual information, we need to figure out what to do with it. No doubt, companies in the United States <U+2014> and frankly any business that benefits from our markets <U+2014> should pay some form of taxes. (Having said that, there are some economists who argue that corporate taxes should be very little or nothing at all <U+2014> assuming that individuals and shareholders then pay more.) Citizens for Tax Justice advocates a litany of rules to end the deferral of foreign income, stop tax inversions and remove loopholes like inconsistent guidelines that allow companies to tell <U+201C>one country that a subsidiary is a corporation while telling another country the same entity is a partnership or some other form.<U+201D> These are laudable goals. How we resolve the disgraceful patchwork of tax rules and loopholes remains an open question. Democrats want policies that create more revenue, and Republicans want policies that create less revenue in the immediate term (they want lower tax rates and suggest that such rates would spur the economy and therefore ultimately create more revenue). Whatever the ultimate resolution, whoever ends up being the next president has the chance to be considered a true <U+201C>genius<U+201D> if he or she tackles the issue in a meaningful and sensible way. Correction: October 5, 2016 The DealBook column on Tuesday, about tax avoidance, using information from a study by the U.S. PIRG Education Fund and Citizens for Tax Justice, misidentified the location where Goldman Sachs was reported to have 537 offshore subsidiaries. It is the Cayman Islands, not Bermuda.

The Jewish Algemeiner writes that <U+201C>the 500th anniversary of the Reformation would be the <U+2018>perfect time<U+2019> for Protestant leaders to recognise and apologise for the <U+2018>horrific antisemitism<U+2019> of their movement<U+2019>s founder, Martin Luther.<U+201D> \nThe truth of the matter is that Martin Luther didn<U+2019>t know about Zionism, Israeli criminality, Alan Dershowitz, Bernie Madoff, Jeffrey Epstein, or Sir Philip Green but he still had a serious problem with the Jews. Back in 1543 he wrote On The Jews and their Lies , a book notorious for its opposition to Jews and their religion. \nRabbi Abraham Cooper<U+2014>associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre<U+2014>wants the Protestants to disown the founding father of their church or at least to <U+201C>directly address the issue (of anti-Semitism) in the overall context of what they<U+2019>re celebrating in terms of this anniversary,<U+201D> \nDavid Michaels of B<U+2019>nai B<U+2019>rith insists that the churches reject some of their founder<U+2019>s teachings. <U+201C>This reality requires committed Lutherans and other Christians to ensure that there is fitting recognition and rejection of Luther<U+2019>s hateful beliefs about Jews, wherever these persist.<U+201D> \nThe Protestant world is clearly being subjected to an institutionalized assault Judaism. But there is one thing the Jewish Algemeiner fails to do. It fails to brief us about Luther<U+2019>s argument against the Jews. The truth of the matter is that Luther<U+2019>s animus towards Jewry wasn<U+2019>t at all racially driven. His arguments against Jews were purely theological rather than biological. Thus, using the term <U+2018>anti-Semitism<U+2019> in reference to Luther is misleading. It leaves one wondering whether Bnai B<U+2019>rith and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre are lying consciously when they refer to Luther as an <U+2018>anti-Semite<U+2019>? If they do, we may actually need to seek the assistance of Luther<U+2019>s book in order to grasp Rabbi Cooper and Michaels<U+2019> conduct. \nGilad Atzmon is an Israeli jazz musician, author and political activist.

While not officially a Democrat, Sanders has expressed dismay over the party<U+2019>s failure to elect Clinton. As he did during his primary campaign, the Vermonter emphasized that today<U+2019>s liberals have simply lost touch with the working class that once used to be the core of their movement. And the fervently independent senator is not alone. Over the weekend, President Barack Obama hinted that Clinton<U+2019>s campaign should have focused more of its outreach beyond the base of the party <U+2014> although the president stressed that a broad overhaul is not necessary. <U+201C>And one message I do have for Democrats is that a strategy that<U+2019>s just micro-targeting particular, discrete groups in a Democratic coalition sometimes will win you elections, but it<U+2019>s not going to win you the broad mandate that you need,<U+201D> Obama told reporters during a joint news conference in Lima, Peru, on Sunday. Continuing with one of the themes of his campaign, Sanders said the focus must be to stand firm on progressive principles. <U+201C>We need candidates <U+2014> black, white and Latino and gay and male, we need all of that. But we need all of those candidates and officials to have the guts to stand up to the oligarchy.

        "input": "time: null \n author: David Risselada \n source: freedomoutpost.com \n text: Email \nMuch to the surprise of the American electorate, both on the right and left, the FBI is reopening it's investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal. Whether this will amount to anything meaningful, or it is simply a distraction is any body's guess. Many are speculating that this could be the issue which would cause President Obama to cancel the elections. In my recent article \"Corrupting One's Self is the Ultimate Morality in the Pursuit of Utopia,\" I discussed the possibility that the blatant corruption is deliberately being thrust in our face to create the necessary attitude for social change. This idea of course, is based on the writings of Alinsky and other \"social engineers\" skilled in the arts of propaganda and psychological manipulation. Looking at it from this perspective, cancelled elections are a possibility. The truth is, with Hillary Clinton you never know what to expect because she is operating from an \"ends justify the means mentality,\" and she is willing to do anything to see her dreams of a collectivized America move forward. \nAccording to Elizabeth Harrington from the Washington Free Beacon, the Clinton campaign began conducting focus groups to determine which approach Hillary should take concerning her run for the presidency. Hillary is diehard ideologue whose beliefs are right in line with Communists dictators like Stalin and Mao. She believes that ordinary people have no idea how to best conduct their personal business and the state should be involved in every aspect of our lives. The goal of these focus groups was to determine the attitudes of the electorate in order to mold her message and her personality into something they would vote for. Many people would attempt to ridicule and discredit anyone associating Hillary Clinton with communists because she comes across as compassionate and caring, always blaming everything on a vast, right wing conspiracy. \nThis has always been the modus operandi of the communist movement and it explains why so many young people have no idea about the atrocities committed under the regimes of communist rulers. Today's millennials are well aware of the holocaust and the millions of Jews murdered by Adolph Hitler. They may not however, know that Hitler murdered more than Jews. He started by eliminating the sick and disabled, then he murdered Christians, homosexuals and anyone else essentially, that didn't go along with his national socialism. The belief is that fascism is an extreme right wing world view. This explains the hostility towards today's conservative movement. They have been branded as fascists, when in fact, the truth is the exact opposite. On the true political scale, national socialism or fascism is to the right of communism, which represents complete state control, but it is still way left of center. A true, extreme right wing world view would be complete absence of government control over anything. With this being said, and understanding that the horrors of communism have all been forgotten simply because they are no longer being taught, the communists have been very successful in deceiving people because like Hillary Clinton, they pretend to be something they are not. \nMillions of young people in America, due to left wing indoctrination in our universities, are falling for the communist propaganda under the guise that communism is a more fair, compassionate system of economics. Left wing professors, refusing to acknowledge the failures of communism because they believe the right leader has not come along to implement it the right way, have failed to teach these young minds that the pursuit of total equality has led to the death of 100,000,000 people under communist controlled governments. Communists, believing not in God but in evolution and science, believe that man can be trained into submission and a refusal to accept communist ideals is in fact, a sign of mental deficiency. Therefore, it is justifiable to eliminate them. To understand this read \"Brainwashing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics.\" Communists also hide this belief by claiming their pursuit of equality is motivated by a pursuit of social and economic justice when in fact, it is motivated by a pure desire to control every aspect of human being. \nThe Black Book of Communism references the historical debate over the evil natures of both Communism and Nazism. Adolf Hitler, despite his cruelty was open about what his intentions were. He set out to create a perfect race that understood its role was to serve the state and nothing else. This isn't any different than the goals of communism truthfully, only insofar as communists seek to accomplish this on a global scale, (using the economic class issue as opposed to race) while national socialism focuses on achieving such a goal for the country itself. The communists on the other hand, as mentioned above, pretended to be compassionate about the poor and oppressed when in reality- they use these groups to organize for power while hiding behind the guise of compassion and the struggle to achieve social justice, while in reality-they are systematically imprisoning and murdering all that don't go along with their agenda. This, according to the Black Book of Communism, makes the communist ideology, if you could really assign degrees of evil, more evil than Nazism because of its deceptive nature. \nWe all know Hillary Clinton is a liar, and she wrote her college thesis on Saul Alinsky but do we know anything else about her? Given the fact that she conducted focus groups to help mold her campaign message it is obvious she is hiding something. Over the past several weeks we have seen references to leaked emails which show she has an obvious disdain for the average American and the common beliefs in liberty that most of us share. She has referred to many of us as \"irredeemable deplorables\" in an effort to brand us as the uncompassionate ones while pretending to care about the poor and so called oppressed. In fact, this is the whole strategy of the Democrat party because as we all know, they have taken a hard turn left and do not represent the views of most Americans. They will however, pretend to in order to get in office. What are her intentions if she were to assume office? Are the massive dehumanization campaigns where conservatives are labeled as fascists and whites as automatic racists a first step to a repeat of history where millions were slaughtered because they were deemed as undesirable by their own government? Looking at the deceptive nature of Hillary Clinton and the violent nature of the left, it sure seems like a distinct possibility. \nThe number of deaths under communist regimes from the Black Book of Communism Soviet Union- Vladimr Lenin and Joseph Stalin-20 million deaths China-Mao- 65 million deaths Vietnam- Ho Chi Mihn- 1 million deaths North Korea- 2 million deaths Cambodia- Pol Pot- 2 million deaths Eastern Europe- 1 million deaths Latin America- 150,000 deaths Africa- 1.7 million deaths Afghanistan (under soviet control) 1.5 million deaths \nThese are not deaths represented by wartime or revolutions, but by outright murder committed by evil men intent on creating perfect societies based on social justice and equality. I guess the question remains. Is man capable of bringing about a perfect society? \nArticle posted with permission from In Defense of Our Nation",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Editor \n source: theeventchronicle.com \n text: Matter and antimatter, simultaneously. By BEC Crew\nAlmost 80 years ago, an Italian physicist proposed that a particle could exist as both matter and antimatter at the same time. Called the Majorana fermion, this mysterious state of matter set off a decades-long hunt, with scientists finding the first real evidence of its existence earlier this year .\nAnd now physicists in China have discovered that an elusive type of quasiparticle can behave just like a Majorana fermion, and it could help us to finally understand this incredibly weird phenomenon.\nIf you<U+2019>re not familiar with the Majorana fermion , it was first proposed by Italian theoretical physicist Ettore Majorana in 1937. He predicted that a type of particle called a fermion could act as its own antiparticle.\nIn the standard model of physics, every particle has an antiparticle. These antiparticles are usually an entirely separate particle, with the same mass but opposite charge of their partner.\nEven electrically neutral particles have antiparticles, such as the neutron, which is made of quarks, and the antineutron, which is made of antiquarks.\nIn very rare cases, a particle with no mass and no charge can act as its own antiparticle, and we<U+2019>ve only identified a few examples of these so far <U+2013> photons (light particles), hypothetical gravitons , and WIMPs .\nMajorana fermions, if they exist, fall into this final category, and if we can find them and harness them, it would change everything about how we record and process information in the next generation of quantum computers.\n<U+201C>The search for this particle is for condensed-matter physicists what the Higgs boson search was for high-energy particle physicists,<U+201D> physicist Leonid Rokhinson from Purdue University noted back in 2012 . <U+201C>It is a very peculiar object because it is a fermion yet it is its own antiparticle with zero mass and zero charge.<U+201D>\nUnlike regular computers that use bits of 0 and 1, quantum computers use quantum bits that can exist in a state of 0, 1, or a superposition of both.\nThe problem with building a computer out of quantum bits (or qubits) is that it<U+2019>s incredibly difficult to make a record of what state they previously held once they<U+2019>ve been switched, and there<U+2019>s no point having a computer that can<U+2019>t retain information.\nBut physicists think Majorana fermions could be the key to solving all of that.\n<U+201C>Information could be stored not in the individual particles, but in their relative configuration, so that if one particle is pushed a little by a local force, it doesn<U+2019>t matter,<U+201D> said Rokhinson .\n<U+201C>As long as that local noise is not so strong that it alters the overall configuration of a group of particles, the information is retained. It offers an entirely new way of dealing with information.<U+201D>\nIn April this year, a team from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee discovered the first real proof of the existence of Majorana fermions in something called a quasiparticle.\nUnlike a regular particle, which is a physical object that makes up an atom, a quasiparticle is an entity that has some characteristics of a distinct particle, but is made up of a grouping of multiple particles instead. Finding a Majorana fermion quasiparticle is one thing, but the real goal is finding a Majorana fermion particle.\nFast-forward to now, and physicists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences say they<U+2019>ve identified another type of quasiparticle that behaves just like a Majorana fermion, called Majorana zero modes (MZMs).\nThe team was able to synthesise these quasiparticles inside a quantum simulation, and manipulate them in ways that would work within a quantum computer system. Most significantly, they showed that they could retain information encoded in their Majorana zero modes, even when errors and <U+2018>noise<U+2019> were applied to the system.\n<U+201C>[W]e demonstrate the immunity of quantum information encoded in the Majorana zero modes against local errors through the simulator,<U+201D> they describe in their paper, published in Nature Communications. \nIf the team<U+2019>s simulation can be replicated in experimental conditions, it means we could have another candidate for Majorana fermion-like behaviours on our hands, and another shot at something to build the quantum computers of the future with.\nIn the meantime, here<U+2019>s more on those elusive Majorana fermions:\n\nSource: Science Alert \n",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Editor \n source: theeventchronicle.com \n text: The rogue work of one nonconformist scientist could one day enable us to grow cheap replacement body parts. Humanity in general and humans in particular have one dream: to live longer than the allotted age. If we could live forever, well, that<U+2019>d be just swell, never mind the consequences.\nHowever enamored to the idea of just swapping out old organs for newer, flawless ones, we<U+2019>re still a long way from mass producing body parts. Sure, there might be a few unorthodox laboratories secretly catering to the specific needs of the 0.01 percent, but these do nothing to benefit the rest of mankind. The reason behind this is that living matter is incredibly well-structured and its organized form is hard to grow outside of living things.\nFor example, you could multiply and grow liver cells in a lab but you would end up with an organic mass unable to serve any useful function. That<U+2019>s because a liver is much more than a number of hepatic cells; these cells need to form tissue, which is fed by blood vessels and crisscrossed by a network of neurons. All this needs to sit inside a scaffold called the extracellular matrix (ECM). Huh, another matrix keeping things together.\nCOLORED IN BLUE ARE HUMAN CELLS GROWING ON AN APPLE SLICE SCAFFOLDING\nWhen growing organs in the lab, scientists don<U+2019>t have a lot of options regarding the scaffolding they use. It<U+2019>s either sourced from live animals and cadavers or 3D printed from proprietary materials. Both these practices are time-consuming and prohibitively expensive. Well, maybe not anymore.\nWe used an apple and it cost pennies.\nMeet scientist-entrepreneur Andrew Pelling. Also a professor at the University of Ottawa, Pelling knows the only way to truly understand the world around us is to be curious and open-minded. That is how he got worldwide recognition for growing human ears from apple slices.\nIn order to do this, Pelling and his team came up with some <U+201C>minor modifications to well-known decellularization protocols that are typically applied to existing organs and tissues.<U+201D> Decellularization is the process through which cells are flushed out from tissue, leaving behind only the extracellular matrix. Scientists have been doing this for decades, but never before has been fruit used to grow human ears.\nSo how did they manage this feat of biohacking? Easy. Pelling<U+2019>s wife is a musical instrument maker so she carves wood for a living. The scientist simply asked his wife to sculpt some ears from Macintosh apples. After removing all the apple cells from the apple ear, Pelling was left with a ready-to-use, cheap cellulose scaffold.\n<U+201C>As weird as this is, it<U+2019>s actually really reminiscent of how our own tissues are organized,<U+201D> Pelling told the audience during a Ted Talk. <U+201C> And we found in our pre-clinical work that you can implant these scaffolds into the body, and the body will send in cells and a blood supply and actually keep these things alive. This is the point when people started asking me,<U+2019> Andrew, can you make body parts out of apples?<U+2019> And I<U+2019>m like, <U+2018>You<U+2019>ve come to the right place.<U+2019><U+201D> \n\nThe importance of this endeavor goes far beyond the shock value of using something as unassuming as an apple to potentially make us live longer. In a very unexpected way, fruits and veggies could help improve the lives of many sufferers. The thing is, you have to set them in a Petri dish rather than a plate.\nSensing the importance of their project, Pelling and his team posted the instructions online as open-source. That way smaller laboratories on a tight budget could one day come up with solutions <U+201C>to repair, rebuild and augment our own bodies with stuff we make in the kitchen.<U+201D> \nThat would leave us with more time to come up with great ideas, a process that coincidentally happens in the same kitchen.\n<U+201C> Now, I was in my kitchen, and I was noticing that when you look down the stalks of these asparagus, what you can see are all these tiny little vessels. And when we image them in the lab, you can see how the cellulose forms these structures. This image reminds me of two things: our blood vessels and the structure and organization of our nerves and spinal cord.<U+201D> \nImagine using asparagus stalks to grow new neurons and them implanting them in the bodies of those with damaged nerve connections. If researched properly, this technology has the potential to save millions.

To the Editor: Neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump would be my choice for president. Nonetheless, as a lifelong Republican, I have decided to vote for the candidate who is the most experienced <U+2014> and that would be Hillary Clinton <U+2014> regardless of the baggage that comes with that candidate. Everywhere you look today, there are problems. In a world seemingly out of control, we need stable leadership, not someone who is constantly running off at the mouth. I don<U+2019>t agree with all of Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s positions. But I<U+2019>m voting for her experience, her knowledge of our country<U+2019>s and the world<U+2019>s complex issues, and the stability she would bring to America. In these difficult times, both domestically and internationally, we don<U+2019>t need an amateur as our president. TED MOOCK Dallas To the Editor: O.K., Donald Trump is awful. I have no intention of voting for him. But just days before the election, perhaps it<U+2019>s time for political pundits to stop trashing him and start examining the alternatives. First, of course, there is Hillary Clinton, a.k.a. <U+201C>the lesser of two evils.<U+201D> Her problem is that most Americans don<U+2019>t trust her. Then there are the third parties. There is something appealing about them. Perhaps it<U+2019>s their long-shot status <U+2014> I doubt if Goldman Sachs would pay even carfare for a speaking engagement by the Libertarian Party<U+2019>s candidate, Gary Johnson, or the Green Party<U+2019>s, Jill Stein. Their challenge is to convince voters that they wouldn<U+2019>t be <U+201C>wasting their vote<U+201D> but <U+201C>sending a message<U+201D> by supporting one of them. Finally, there<U+2019>s the option of not voting for anyone for president. I don<U+2019>t mean staying home on Election Day. The down-ballot races are important, too. But it<U+2019>s not apostasy to leave that box on top unchecked. JOHN E. STAFFORD Rye, N.Y. To the Editor: Hillary Clinton is not just the first woman to be a major-party nominee for president; she now also holds the distinction of being the first candidate to be under the shadow of a possible reopening of an F.B.I. investigation heading into the election. Win, lose or draw, this is something that could dog her for years. Do we really need another Clinton administration frozen in scandal? Instead we can choose a legendary businessman who says he will cut taxes for the middle class, build a wall to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and illicit drugs, and make us the energy capital of the world. Is it really that difficult a choice? EUGENE DUNN Medford, N.Y. To the Editor: I have voted Democratic for the past 60 years. This year will be my last. I will switch to independent after I hold my nose and vote for Hillary Clinton. It was very upsetting to see how little the Democratic National Committee did to support Bernie Sanders during the primaries, going all out for Hillary. By anointing Hillary and not seeking alternative candidates, the D.N.C. did us a great disservice. Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s low ratings didn<U+2019>t just evolve during this election. She was a known quantity. Will the new chairperson of the D.N.C. learn from this election? EVELYN WOLFSON Wayland, Mass. To the Editor: It is time to stand up to the character assassination attempts against Hillary Clinton. No person in public office or politics is pure, and to expect no flaws is unrealistic. Hillary has been strongly speaking out for those with limited voices (the impoverished, people of color, women and children, etc.) ever since her college days. She has been excoriated by the machine of public opinion for so many petty reasons, and there have been several attempts to catch her at any potentially illegal act. Despite this, she has prevailed and continued to speak out for those less fortunate. Regardless of any flaws that she has, it would be a travesty to see our nation wake up on Nov. 9 to discover that voters have elected a demagogic narcissist as our president. Anyone out there who doesn<U+2019>t want to feel Brexit regret must think over his or her vote very carefully, because everyone<U+2019>s vote bears a great weight in this election. RITA BABAUTA KILEY Eugene, Ore. To the Editor: Susan Faludi attributes opposition to Hillary Clinton to misogyny (<U+201C> How Hillary Clinton Met Satan ,<U+201D> Sunday Review, Oct. 30). I vividly recall the sexist rants directed at Mrs. Clinton in the 1990s, and I defended her at that time. Today, though, I find myself opposed to Mrs. Clinton, and not because I have the slightest qualm about electing a woman as president. Ms. Faludi is right to point out misogyny<U+2019>s persistence, but fails to acknowledge that some of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s opponents legitimately disagree with her hawkishness, centrism and dubious ethics. If anyone can convincingly justify Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s use of a private email server, deletion of 33,000 email messages, ties to Wall Street, whopping speaking fees and the fund-raising practices of the Clinton Foundation, I will vote for her. Otherwise, I will not. CHRIS RASMUSSEN Highland Park, N.J. To the Editor: Many voters abhor the Republican candidate and can<U+2019>t stand Hillary Clinton, so they proudly announce their intention to abstain from voting for either. Those who fail to choose not only shirk their civic duty, but they also leave this monumental decision to others. Rest assured that the haters <U+2014> the racists, the misogynists, the xenophobes and the gay-bashers <U+2014> will be sure to turn out for their candidate. One of the major-party candidates will be the next president. A vote for a third-party candidate goes beyond foolishness; it is simply self-indulgence. The only way to avoid disaster in November is to elect Hillary Clinton, like her or not. So I suggest those self-righteous abstainers get to the polls, take a deep breath and pull the lever next to Hillary<U+2019>s name. Don<U+2019>t consider it a vote for her; consider it a vote to preserve our Republic. RICHARD C. HENNEBERRY Melbourne, Fla. To the Editor: I first registered to vote in 1956 <U+2014> as an independent voter <U+2014> and have never missed a local, state or national election in 60 years. My votes have always been for those candidates I believed would best serve their constituents and not for their party affiliation. On Nov. 8, however, I will show up at my polling place with a clothespin on my nose, and I urge my fellow voters to do the same so as to show our disdain for the candidates foisted on us by the two major political parties.

It turned out to be nothing <U+2013> just a protester with a sign. At the time it all looked pretty chaotic and frightening, but it turned out that Trump was just fine. The <U+201C>gun<U+201D> turned out to be an anti-Trump poster. The man turned out to be a Republican who just wanted the opportunity to protest what Trump had done to his party with a <U+201C>Republicans against Trump<U+201D> sign. There was no threat. \nThose facts don<U+2019>t matter to the Trump team, though, as campaign manager Kellyanne Conway went on CNN<U+2019>s State of the Union and insisted to host Jake Tapper that it was indeed a very real attempt on Trump<U+2019>s life. \nFirst, Tapper inquired as to why Trump<U+2019>s people were <U+201C>retweeting misinformation that this was an assassination attempt.<U+201D> Conway responded: \n<U+201C>It<U+2019>s scary. All the coverage is usually about our protesters wreaking havoc and making people feel afraid. And it certainly goes both ways. I<U+2019>m with Mr. Trump and the Secret Service routinely. They do an amazing job. \nI also want to point out because some people are spreading misinformation about the protester. He had canvassed for Hillary Clinton and he had donated to her campaign. So, this is a Democratic plant or operative trying to disrupt our rally. And I think people saw a nimble resilient Donald Trump who would be nimble and resilient as president as well.<U+201D> \nTapper called Conway on her bullshit, though, and shot back: \n<U+201C>Except it wasn<U+2019>t an assassination attempt. It was apparently a local voter, a Republican who says he is supporting Hillary Clinton. He has given money to Hillary Clinton. He has canvassed for Hillary Clinton. But he says he<U+2019>s a Republican. But most importantly, he was not trying to assassinate anyone.<U+201D> \nThis was not an assassination attempt, but why is your campaign spreading that it was?<U+201D> \nConway waffled, saying, <U+201C>That<U+2019>s really remarkable. That that<U+2019>s what the storyline is here.<U+201D> \nOf course, she then did what Trumpkins backed into corners always do, and tried to start changing the subject to the imagined sins of Hillary Clinton. She insisted that the only reason Beyonce, Jay Z and other A-List stars were on the trail with Hillary was that nobody wanted to go to Hillary rallies. Finally, Conway said she<U+2019>d consider changing the assassination lie if CNN went on the record against <U+201C>all the storylines, all the headlines, all the breathless predictions of the last two weeks that turned out not to be true.<U+201D> \nTapper said to that: \n<U+201C>I never reported anything along those lines.<U+201D> \nAnd irritable Conway insisted: \n<U+201C>CNN certainly has. You<U+2019>ve got to be honest here.<U+201D> \nTapper continued, <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve been saying all along that Donald Trump has a path to the presidency.<U+201D> \nConway then interjected with her trademark <U+201C>WOW!<U+201D> \nTapper plowed on, though, and nailed the humiliation home, and actually laughed in her face, saying: \n<U+201C>You can say <U+2018>wow<U+2019> all you want, I<U+2019>ve never said that the race was over. We can replay as many tapes as you want.<U+201D> \nTapper was right to hammer Conway like this. Trump<U+2019>s entire campaign has been one big con job, built upon fear, ignorance, bigotry, incompetence, and lies.

And I think, probably the most important things experts would agree on is we need a larger mandate penalty<U+201C><U+2026> Gruber<U+2019>s arrogance is incredible. Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree. Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. <U+201C>ObamaCare was never designed *not* to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs,<U+201D> points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldn<U+2019>t come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people. A series of videos that emerged in 2014 featured Gruber admitting that Obamacare was deceptively crafted in order to fool <U+201C>stupid<U+201D> Americans into not realizing that it would mean massive price hikes and that the law<U+2019>s <U+201C>lack of transparency (was) a huge political advantage<U+201D> in selling it. \nSUBSCRIBE on YouTube:",

I dont know what no one else can see this. We know who rigged this election, from primary to the predictable nomination, and then the turn on Trump, the pawn, in the general election. I just watched, and tried to share on social media the truth about what had happened, but everyone was lining up with the staus quo account of what was happening <U+2013> Trump was an out of control idiot, well duh, but yes, be angry at Trump <U+2013> but be truly angry about those who made him the only choice against Hillary. It is about the corruption and propaganda in the corporate media, the unwillingness to the public media, and the entertainment media to discuss the elephant in the room <U+2013> and I sure dont mean the republican elephant <U+2013> I am talking about the unmentionable oligarchy that is the root of everything that we, the people, find deplorable in our government. If you use only television to try and understand our world you will be lost in a matrix (urban dictionary) of misdirections, propaganda, and cheerleading for the direction they want us to think. I dont even know why they bother. Information like that which came from WiliLeaks is the last vestige, unless you are a fly on the wall, that will even get you close to being able to form an opinion from unbiased material. Other than that information it takes a talent to read between the lines, collect from what is omitted, a see just how far the public news media is willing to push the envelope. Beyond that you have to look at what is being censured by all forms of media; the A&E 9-11 Truth Movement, and from beyond the border, the works of Professor John McMurtry. I am beginning to see among those who have the intellect to see this massive misdirection, the obvious rigging of our 2016 election, the impending end out our species due to the dominate economic system; an unwillingness to do the work to deconstruct the truth. The best of us are giving up and would rather remain in denial of what is happening. When I have gone to the effort to try and explain on social media how all this created misdirection of anger towards Trump, who is an idiot, should actually be against the corporate media and the powers who control them. The destroyed our chance to elect a qualified actual anti status quo candidate by blacking out the coverage of Bernie Sanders while at the same time giving Trump, and unqualified idiot, unprecedented, unquestioned, airtime. This in effect replaced Sanders with Trump. To me it was so obvious. I knew and posted that the corporate media, after the nomination, would eviscerate Trump, using information they already had in the hole to counter what ever October surprise would be coming out against Hillary. Hillary needed to be pitted against an idiot pawn, like the predictable Trump, to ensure a win of another insider in the executive branch. I have watch as the Bill Mahers and the Michael Moores have become part of the subset of the 1%, who have crossed that line into the area of comfortability and security, which they are unwilling to sacrifice, this becoming part of those who are unwilling to truly push the envelope into any are resembling the truth of what is truly happening. Mahers and Moore have become part of the establishment propaganda machine. The same is happening of non profit news media, like DemocracyNow. While not so much helping the establishment push their agenda they have either been corrupted by the corporate powers, as with NPR and the Guardian, or they do not have the financial stability to risk telling us the full truth. Only as individuals in such online rags as the Washington Blog, and what pitifully little someone like me can contribute, do we see what a few of us are still willing to say what we think. There are many more I am afraid who are unorganized, in denial, or have just given up. The hopefulness of the Internet to keep the avenues of truth open, through the works of WikiLeaks and the social philosophers beyond the border, like Prof. John McMurtry, are we catching the last glimpse of the light of truth. The NSA is quickly surpassing this last exposure to the light. From the dark, the perception of light becomes brighter as the door dividing them begins to close. If the search for truth is difficult, the telling of truth, a crime, and the speaking of truth an insurrection, then we are correct in our assertion that a new truth is needed <U+2013> or an old truth rediscovered. To find and reopen this door, to let back in the light, will be far more difficult once the darkness prevails.

Trump<U+2019>s criticism of the Jews is far more subtle than his disapproval of other groups and identities (Mexicans, Muslims, Women etc). Though Trump is not known for pulling his punches, when it comes to the Jews, Trump chooses his words very carefully. Trump, according to Greenberg, is so careful <U+201C>that it<U+2019>s not clear that Trump himself fully understands the implications of what he<U+2019>s saying.<U+201D> I guess that the Jewish academic couldn<U+2019>t restrain herself from looking down at the Goy candidate. \nGreenberg sees Trump as a puppet-master who controls his audience by means of <U+2018>dog whistling<U+2019>. <U+201C>Trump<U+2019>s references to money, bankers and international conspiracies appear to be deliberate anti-Semitic dog whistles, and his alt-right supporters recognize (and celebrate) that.<U+201D> \nGreenberg elaborates on her observation, <U+201C>first of all, dog whistles serve when overt expressions are not an option; they communicate to those who are familiar with the conspiracy theories but maintain plausible deniability.<U+201D> According to Greenberg, when Trump wants to communicate a message about the Jews, he uses an indecipherable code intelligible only to half of the Americans<U+2026> Greenberg and the ADL. \nIf Greenberg is correct, if Trump says <U+2018>international Bankers<U+2019> but really means Jews, then both the Republican candidate and half of the American people are fearful of the Jews. They must very well understand what a confrontation with Jewish institutions may entail. They know that, in America, criticism of Mexicans, Women, and Muslims is a kosher territory but even a subtle criticism of Jews may cost them dearly. One may wonder, how did this happen? What is the substance of that magical power that empowers half of Americans to speak in codes when they think about Jews? \nGreenberg seems to raise the right question just to come up with the wrong answer. <U+201C>Why would anti-Semitism not be an overt option, while racism, sexism, and xenophobia are?<U+201D> \n<U+201C>Americans are less willing to accept blatant anti-Semitism than racism,<U+201D> Greenberg<U+2019>s answers. \nWhat Greenberg really wants to say is that Americans can be racists and can say whatever they like about whoever they want. But when it comes to Jews, they refrain. Americans do know very well the geography of the boundaries of correctness. Jewish power is for them a taboo, at least momentarily. America and Americans are fully aware of the enormous power that is bestowed in the hands of just a few Jewish oligarchs within the ubiquitous industries of media, finance, politics, and culture. \nAmerica would have loved to dissolve the situation peacefully but it can<U+2019>t. Jewish power can<U+2019>t be contained or suppressed because we are not even allowed to allude to it, let alone point it out. \nJewish power is defined as the power to silence criticism of Jewish power. Jewish power, as such, is a ticking timebomb. It is a unique form of self-destructiveness. The history of the Jews proves this point. Time after time it is Jewish power that sets the path towards a glamorous Jewish golden age that leads to the most severe tragic consequences. \nThe Jewish phobia of anti semitism is not driven by fear of the gentile. It is actually the other way around. The Jewish fear of antisemitism is the result of Jews being fearful of their own might. Jews tend to recognise that there is something in themselves that evokes animosity from others. This is the true meaning of the Jewish <U+201C>Pre Traumatic Stress Syndrome<U+201D>. It is the acceptance that from here forward, things can only get worse. Many Jews see in Trump<U+2019>s popularity a symptom of a fatigue of their own power. They interpret the nostalgic yearning for <U+2018>America being great<U+2019> as a pining for a Christian past. Something that predates Goldman Sachs<U+2019> and Soros<U+2019> dominion. The Jewish aggression towards Trump can be realised as an expression of Jewish guilt. Yet, Trump himself has very little to do with it. He married his daughter to a Jew. He trades with Jews, he loves Israel. He is almost as Jewish as the Clintons. \nGreenberg is optimistic. For her, Trump<U+2019>s popularity is <U+201C>the final gasping of white supremacy<U+201D>. His voters <U+2013> pretty much half of the American people <U+2013> are dogs reacting to a man with a whistle. I am not as optimistic as Greenberg. I think that exploring such contempt towards half of the American people in the name of a vague progressive mantra is a very dangerous game. It suggests to me that progressives have reached a state of complete detachment. Related Posts:",

If Hillary Clinton wins, she will move forward with the Obama administration<U+2019>s combination of domestic clean-energy policies and international negotiation <U+2014> a one-two punch that offers some hope of reining in greenhouse gas emissions before climate change turns into climate catastrophe. If Donald Trump wins, the paranoid style in climate politics <U+2014> the belief that global warming is a hoax perpetrated by a vast international conspiracy of scientists <U+2014> will become official doctrine, and catastrophe will become all but inevitable. So why does the media seem so determined to ignore this issue? Why, in particular, does it almost seem as if there<U+2019>s a rule against bringing it up in debates? Before I get there, a brief summary of the policy divide. It<U+2019>s strange how little credit the Obama administration gets for its environmental policies. Everyone has heard about how loan guarantees to one solar-energy company, Solyndra, went sour <U+2014> at a cost, by the way, that amounted to only a bit more than half the amount Mr. Trump personally lost in just one year thanks to bad business decisions . Few people, by contrast, have heard about the green energy revolution that the administration<U+2019>s loans and other policy support helped promote, with plunging prices and soaring consumption of solar and wind power . Nor have many heard about the administration<U+2019>s tightening of fuel efficiency standards , especially for trucks and buses, which in itself is one of the most significant environmental moves in decades. And if Mrs. Clinton wins, it<U+2019>s more or less certain that the biggest moves yet <U+2014> the Clean Power Plan , which would regulate emissions from power plants, and the Paris climate agreement , which commits all of the world<U+2019>s major economies to make significant emission cuts <U+2014> will become reality. Meanwhile, there<U+2019>s Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly called climate change a hoax and has suggested that it was invented by China to hurt U.S. competitiveness. I wish I could say that this puts him outside the mainstream of his party, but it doesn<U+2019>t. So there is a huge, incredibly consequential divide on climate policy. Not only is there a vast gap between the parties and their candidates, but this gap arguably matters more for the future than any of their other disagreements. So why don<U+2019>t we hear more about it? I<U+2019>m not saying that there has been no reporting on the partisan climate divide, but there has been nothing like, say, the drumbeat of stories about Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s email server. And it<U+2019>s really stunning that in the three nationally televised forums we<U+2019>ve had so far <U+2014> the <U+201C>commander in chief<U+201D> forum involving Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, the first presidential debate and the vice-presidential debate <U+2014> the moderators have asked not a single question about climate. This was especially striking in Tuesday<U+2019>s debate. Somehow Elaine Quijano, the moderator, found time for not one but two questions inspired by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget <U+2014> an organization concerned that despite relatively low budget deficits now and extremely low borrowing costs, the federal government may face fiscal problems a couple of decades down the line. There may be something to this, although not as much as deficit scolds claim (and Ms. Quijano managed to suggest that Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s proposals, which are fully paid for , are no better than Mr. Trump<U+2019>s multitrillion-dollar debt blowout). But if we<U+2019>re worried about the longer-term implications of current policies, the buildup of greenhouse gases is a much bigger deal than the accumulation of low-interest debt. It<U+2019>s bizarre to talk about the latter but not the former. And this blind spot matters a lot. Polling suggests that millennial voters , in particular, care a lot about environmental protection and renewable energy. But it also suggests that more than 40 percent of young voters believe that there is no difference between the candidates on these issues. Yes, I know, people should be paying more attention <U+2014> but this nonetheless tells us how easy it is for voters who rely on TV news or don<U+2019>t read stories deep inside the paper to miss what should be a central issue in this campaign. The good news is that there are still two debates to go, offering the opportunity to make some amends. It<U+2019>s time to end the blackout on climate change as an issue. It needs to be front and center <U+2014> and questions must be accompanied by real-time fact-checking, not relegated to the limbo of he-said-she-said, because this is one of the issues where the truth often gets lost in a blizzard of lies. There is, quite simply, no other issue this important, and letting it slide would be almost criminally irresponsible.

It<U+2019>s a Hail Mary,' one Washington State elector says. By Kyle Cheney 11/14/16 02:33 PM EST Updated 11/14/16 10:40 PM EST Two Democratic members of the Electoral College have launched a radical last-ditch attempt to stop Donald Trump from winning the presidency. P. Bret Chiafalo, a Washington State elector who has already declared his opposition to Hillary Clinton, and Micheal Baca of Colorado have launched what they<U+2019>ve dubbed <U+201C>Moral Electors,<U+201D> an attempt to persuade 37 of their Republican colleagues to bail on Trump <U+2014> just enough to block Trump<U+2019>s election and leave the final decision to the House of Representatives. They have the support of a third elector , Washington State<U+2019>s Robert Satiacum. Story Continued Below <U+201C>This is a longshot. It<U+2019>s a Hail Mary,<U+201D> Chiafalo said in a phone interview. <U+201C>However, I do see situations where <U+2014> when we<U+2019>ve already had two or three [Republican] electors state publicly they didn<U+2019>t want to vote for Trump. How many of them have real issues with Donald Trump in private?<U+201D> Chiafalo, a self-described <U+201C>regular nerdy dude who works for Microsoft<U+201D> and Baca, a grad student and Marine Corps veteran, insist they<U+2019>re not seeking the election of Clinton <U+2014> or even a Democrat. Both, in fact, had already been considering voting against her when the Electoral College meets in five weeks. Rather, they intend to encourage Republican electors to write in Mitt Romney or John Kasich. If enough agree, the election would be sent to the House of Representatives, which would choose from among the top three vote-getters. Both men acknowledge that their effort is unlikely to succeed. Electors throughout American history have rarely broken ranks. But the fact that members of the college <U+2014> part of an arcane but powerful constitutional process <U+2014> are working to undermine Trump could lead to a larger share of dissident electors than the country has seen in decades and put renewed focus on calls to abolish the controversial body. Congress By Burgess Everett The Electoral College<U+2019>s 538 members are slated to gather in their respective state capitals on Dec. 19 to cast the formal vote for president. Trump won the popular vote in states making up 290 electoral votes <U+2014> and he<U+2019>s leading narrowly in Michigan, which carries another 16 electoral votes. If all of them vote for Trump, he<U+2019>ll win 306 electoral votes, easily exceeding the 270-vote majority he needs to become president. That<U+2019>s why Chiafalo and Baca are seeking to flip 37 Republican colleagues. <U+201C>Faithless electors,<U+201D> those who buck the will of their states<U+2019> voters, have been rare in American history, and they<U+2019>ve never swung the outcome of an election. The last one came in 2004, when a Minnesota elector slated to support John Kerry cast his vote for Kerry<U+2019>s running mate, John Edwards. And the last time there was more than one faithless elector voting for president came in 1872 , when Democratic candidate Horace Greeley died after Election Day. The rarity of faithless electors is partly because electors are reluctant to reject the will of the voters, and it<U+2019>s also because 29 states have laws mandating that electors support the winner of the state popular vote. These laws, though, have never been enforced or challenged. And some constitutional lawyers believe they<U+2019>re invalid. In addition, some of these laws only impose modest fines but provide no recourse to change the outcome. Chiafalo and Baca say they<U+2019>re hopeful that Trump<U+2019>s uniquely polarizing persona could convince enough Republican electors to sideline him. Already electors have faced a torrent of pressure from anti-Trump forces to buck his election. A Change.org petition urging electors to support Clinton <U+2013> the winner of the national popular vote <U+2014> has garnered more than 4 million signatures. That effort has won vocal support from celebrities like Lady Gaga <U+2014> though no prominent Democrats have taken up the call. Baca and Chiafalo said their effort is likelier to make inroads because it<U+2019>s coming from within the Electoral College, and it<U+2019>s focused on gentle persuasion rather than encouraging thousands of voters to rein down emails and phone calls. Presidential Transition By Eli Stokols Several Republican electors have expressed reservations about Trump, though most committed to voting for him. Arizona elector Jane Lynch, for example, told POLITICO in August she would only reluctantly cast her electoral vote for Trump. Reached after the election, Lynch said she still intended to honor that commitment. And Chris Suprun, who told POLITICO in August he was considering rejecting Trump has since reversed course and committed to supporting him. Georgia elector Baoky Vu resigned after he came out against Trump. The only Republican elector on record considering a break from Trump is in Texas. Art Sisneros, a libertarian activist, told POLITICO in August that he might reject Trump when he casts his formal vote. Contacted Monday, Sisneros affirmed he<U+2019>s still <U+201C>undecided<U+201D> about his vote. He said he hasn<U+2019>t been pressured by state party leaders but has heard from fellow Republican electors pushing him to vote for Trump. And a Virginia elector, Erich Reimer, signaled he'd consider casting his electoral vote against Trump if GOP leaders made a concerted decision to use electors to sideline him <U+2014> but Clinton won the state. Baca, the Colorado elector, said he<U+2019>s hopeful that even if the effort fails, it could cause enough consternation about the Electoral College to reignite debate about abolishing it. Democrats clamored for it after the 2000 election in which Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College to George W. Bush. That outcome mirrored the Clinton-Trump results as well. He acknowledged that succeeding, even on that score, is a pipe dream <U+2014> but he said he<U+2019>s still hopeful. <U+201C>It was a pipe dream that the Cubs were going to win the World Series,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Pipe dreams come true.<U+201D> By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

Black women<U+2019>s poverty rates are <U+201C>almost five times higher than that of white Canadian women.<U+201D> In Montreal, <U+201C>a 2008 study found that black girls are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more.<U+201D> Realities Faced by Black Canadians are a National Shame by Robyn Maynard \nThis article previously appeared in the Montreal Gazette . \n<U+201C> Black Montrealers continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions.<U+201D> \nAfter holding consultations in Quebec, Nova Scotia and Ontario last month, the United Nations Working Group on People of African Descent issued a statement that sheds light on realities, too-often invisible to most Canadians, that should be seen as a national shame. \nThe group<U+2019>s preliminary findings confirm what is already well known in Canada<U+2019>s black communities: that systemic discrimination has subjected black people to racial profiling by law enforcement, soaring incarceration rates, disproportionate poverty and poor health, the over-apprehension of black children by child welfare agencies and lower graduation rates. Black women, they note, face a rate of poverty that is almost five times higher than that of white Canadian women, and are one of the fastest-growing groups in federal prisons. \nUnderlying these injustices, the UN Working Group has made clear, is systemic racism. \nThe UN is right to be concerned, and Montreal is by no means exempt from this criticism: Both its historical and contemporary realities are defined by a systemic anti-blackness that goes too frequently un-named. The enslavement of black (and indigenous) persons was not an uncommon practice in New France, and indeed was legal until 1834. The fact of slavery remains all around us: acclaimed art historian Charmaine Nelson reminds us that many present-day Montreal streets, buildings and institutions are named after white businessmen like James McGill and John Redpath who traded in plantation crops worked by slave labor. \nEnslavement may be over, but centuries later black Montrealers <U+2014> the largest visible minority in the city <U+2014> continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions. A 2010 study by sociologists L<U+00E9>onel Bernard and Christopher McAll found that it was over-surveillance, and not the rates of so-called <U+201C>black crime,<U+201D> that accounted for up to 60 per cent of the over-incarceration of black youth in Montreal. \n<U+201C>The enslavement of black (and indigenous) persons was not an uncommon practice in New France, and indeed was legal until 1834.<U+201D> \nA report commissioned by the Montreal police, leaked to La Presse, found that in St-Michel and Montr<U+00E9>al-Nord, up to 40 per cent of black youth were stopped in 2006-2007, a rate that indicates a high degree of racial profiling by police officers. Much of this heightened policing was justified to the public as curbing <U+201C>gang activities,<U+201D> when in reality, in 2009, only 1.6 per cent of crimes were gang related. High profile cases of police abuse of black Montrealers and alleged abuse continue to surface, including the recent case of Veckqueth Stevenson, a legally blind black man in his 50s, who has accused the police of using excessive force and unjustly arresting him, ironically, while he was at Nelson Mandela Park. \nBlack women and girls are not exempt, though we hear even less about their experiences locally; the case of Majiza Philip, a black woman who says she had her arm broken by police in 2014, is one example, however. A 2008 study found that black girls in Montreal are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more. \nBeyond the criminal justice system, numerous studies have demonstrated that black children are apprehended from their homes by child welfare at alarming rates in Montreal, and this, too, can be attributed to racism. \nThe UN Working group is not the first to point out these injustices, nor are they the only ones proposing solutions. Black Lives Matter-Toronto and other black activist groups in Toronto, Kingston, Ottawa, Vancouver and Montreal have been steadily mobilizing to address anti-black racism. Across cities, black communities have denounced, among other issues, the recent deaths of Abdirahman Abdi in Ottawa, and Bony Jean-Pierre in Montreal, both at the hands of police in 2016. \nIf Canada intends to genuinely reckon with its still-living legacy of black enslavement, the injustices brought to light by the UN <U+2014> alongside those highlighted by black activists around the country <U+2014> need to be both addressed and redressed. Robyn Maynard is an activist and writer living in Montreal, author of the forthcoming book Policing Black Bodies (2017).",

An hour later, the response had changed: <U+201C>Pressing the worry button now.<U+201D> I got off work at midnight, and listened to the radio as I drove home. It was by then Nov. 9, and the election was coming to an end. But it didn<U+2019>t hit me until I saw my mom. When I got home, she was awake and watching the television, her face paralyzed by distress. I realized we were in trouble. I have lived in the United States as long as I can remember, but I am undocumented, Mexican by birth. My parents came to the United States because my father was in danger. He served in the Mexican military, but was scapegoated for leaked information and could have been killed. My parents decided to leave for California in 1997, and a year later, my sister and I, ages 5 and 2, joined them. My parents scraped by selling tamales in the streets of Los Angeles, and my sister and I grew up as Californians. But there was always a huge difference between us and many of our classmates. After my sister graduated, she returned to Mexico because she couldn<U+2019>t see a future here, blocked from pursuing higher education and a job. Her absence has been extremely painful for my family. We haven<U+2019>t seen her in five years. Still in high school, I thought I would have to follow her, but the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals executive order issued by President Obama in 2012 changed my life. It allowed me to work provisionally in the United States and even qualify for college scholarships. Most important, I was protected from deportation. Around the same time, progressive states like California began to implement laws that provided access to higher education and employment. I started to dream about stability, about a secure life in the United States. But then a gang member threatened my father, and my parents had no choice but to move or risk being killed. They left for Indiana, where my aunt lives, and she helped them start over again. I decided to stay in California where there was more opportunity for undocumented people, so I said goodbye. I fell into a routine of working and going to high school. I was making enough to make ends meet, thanks to a kind landlord who kept my rent cheap. But I couldn<U+2019>t keep my grades up while I was working more than 40 hours a week. Finally, after four years apart from my family, I joined them in Indiana. Things started looking up: I found a well-paying job at a convenience store chain and started to attend Ivy Tech Community College, where I became the vice president of the student government. I noticed an immense difference because of being closer to my family. I was doing better. I got my own car and raised my grades to a 3.5 G.P.A. Now, with Donald Trump soon to be president, I<U+2019>m uncertain of any protection for what my family has built, let alone for the future of so many families like ours. His election legitimizes discrimination against, and the dehumanization of, the entire undocumented community. I<U+2019>m worried about my work permit. I worry about violence and the deportation of my parents and myself. I worry that my two younger siblings <U+2014> both U.S. citizens <U+2014> will be separated from my parents. I fear that many conservative states like Indiana will push for harsher anti-immigrant laws, and that Mr. Trump will nominate Supreme Court justices who will rule in favor of harsh state laws like those that Alabama and Arizona passed several years ago. Although parts of those laws were softened or ruled unconstitutional , they were unprecedented in the power they gave to the police to check immigration status. Alabama<U+2019>s law even allowed teachers to question students they suspected of being undocumented, and made it a crime to employ, house or even give rides to undocumented people. That law was also an economic disaster. After it was passed, tens of thousands of people left the state, costing up to $10.8 billion in lost income and tax revenues, according to one University of Alabama study. Farms dried up, construction slowed and investment went down. But a Republican-run House, Senate and executive branch, and a Supreme Court that may soon have a conservative majority, may approve similar anti-immigration laws that will make conditions in the United States unbearable for many families. I fear that all the hard-won progress to create a friendly country for immigrants will be destroyed, and the federal government will forgo any initiatives to establish a path to citizenship. Undocumented people are not a drag on the United States. Not only do we contribute billions of dollars in taxes (and would pay more if we had some sort of legal status), we are part of a long history of people who came to this country to seek opportunity through hard work. The United States economy needs the work of immigrants. It always has. I am trying to remain hopeful. The next four years will be difficult for many groups <U+2014> not just undocumented immigrants but also women, black and L.G.B.T. communities, and Muslims. We can coalesce around one another. Progress is made by resisting, and pushing back, by holding on to hope and building resilience. Immigrants are here to stay. So we will wait for Mr. Trump<U+2019>s next move, hold our lawmakers accountable and fight back. Miguel Molina is a student at Ivy Tech Community College.

        "input": "time: null \n author: THE EDITORIAL BOARD \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/opinion/donald-trumps-impeachment-threat.html?_r=0 \n text: Donald Trump and other embattled Republican candidates are resorting to a particularly bizarre and dangerous tactic in the closing days of the campaign <U+2014> warning that they may well seek to impeach Hillary Clinton if she wins, or, short of that, tie her up with endless investigations and other delaying tactics. Of all the arguments advanced by the Trump forces, this has to be among the most preposterous. In effect, what they<U+2019>re saying is, Mrs. Clinton won<U+2019>t be able to govern, because we won<U+2019>t let her. So don<U+2019>t waste your vote on her. Vote for us. In a rational world <U+2014> you know, one that values comity and progress in the national interest <U+2014> this line of argument would be seen as incendiary at worst and hopelessly wacky at best. Not so in Trumpland, where the candidate himself warns (as he did in Miami on Wednesday) that a Clinton victory would <U+201C>create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis,<U+201D> raising the specter that government would be severely hobbled by congressional Republicans<U+2019> open-ended investigations and a determination to impeach Mrs. Clinton. All this even if she was fairly elected by a majority of American voters. <U+201C>Haven<U+2019>t we just been through a lot with the Clintons?<U+201D> Mr. Trump asked. <U+201C>The work of government would grind to a halt if she were ever elected.<U+201D> The tactic is a rejection of the nation<U+2019>s need of a functioning government and a tacit concession that Mr. Trump may be losing and that he can be saved only by more scare tactics. Other Republican candidates in tight races have picked up this theme. The G.O.P. phrase du jour is <U+201C>constitutional crisis,<U+201D> depicting a hog-tied executive and a Republican Congress obsessed with perpetuating their demonization of Mrs. Clinton. Senator Richard Burr, campaigning for re-election in North Carolina, took the Trump fantasy one step further, telling supporters : <U+201C>Could she pardon herself? And the answer is yes.<U+201D> Rudy Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s most zealous acolytes, echoed this cry to carry the battle forward into a Clinton administration. <U+201C>I guarantee you in one year she<U+2019>ll be impeached and indicted,<U+201D> Mr. Giuliani promised Iowa voters this week. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s just going to happen. We<U+2019>re going to sort of vote for a Watergate.<U+201D> As nonsensical as this strategy appears, these threats could cause real damage by encouraging Republicans in the next Congress to effectively take the government hostage, exacting revenge by making sure that nothing Mrs. Clinton proposes ever comes to pass. President Obama put it well in underlining the dangers. <U+201C>Right now, because a lot of them think that Trump will lose, they<U+2019>re already promising even more unprecedented dysfunction in Washington,<U+201D> he told North Carolina voters this week. <U+201C>How does our democracy function like that?<U+201D> That is not a question remotely of interest to Mr. Trump, in his kamikaze politicking. Yet in recalling the tumultuous impeachment of President Bill Clinton, Mr. Trump neglects to note that he was opposed to it, writing in 2000 that he <U+201C>got a chuckle out of all the moralists in Congress and in the media.<U+201D> Mr. Giuliani, before his servile devotion to Mr. Trump, also opposed Mr. Clinton<U+2019>s impeachment. Beyond simple hypocrisy, the Republicans<U+2019> impeachment threat demonstrates their gathering disrespect for democracy. If they can<U+2019>t gain control of government fairly, they<U+2019>ll simply undermine it. It is the clearest warning yet that voters must deliver a firm rejection of the politics of division that Mr. Trump represents.

Those saying they have <U+201C>some<U+201D> respect for police is down to 17 percent and those claiming to have <U+201C>hardly any<U+201D> respect for police is down to 7 percent. \nThe Gallup survey flies in the face of the narrative of leftists and Black Lives Matter. They<U+2019>re trying to convince Americans <U+2013> especially black Americans <U+2013> that the police are on a racist rampage and that they have nothing more to fear in this country than a man in uniform. \nBut the public doesn<U+2019>t buy it. \nWith both whites and <U+201C>non-whites,<U+201D> respect for police is up sharply. Four in five white Americans say they have <U+201C>a great deal<U+201D> of respect for the police in their area, while just over two in three <U+201C>non-whites<U+201D> also say they have a <U+201C>great deal<U+201D> of respect. \nRespect for police is highest among Republicans, at 86 percent, but even 68 percent of Democrats claim a <U+201C>great deal<U+201D> of respect. \nAdults 55 and older (81%) have the most respect, but even those 18-34 had high levels of respect at 71%. \nThere is a moral to this for the BLM Social Justice Warriors: You can paint our cops as racist thugs, but we know better. Police risk their lives every day to protect us and deserve our utmost respect. And judging by this poll, they<U+2019>re getting it. \nFrom the Gallup Poll: \nThe sharp increase over the past year in professed respect for local law enforcement comes as many police say they feel they are on the defensive <U+2014> both politically and for their lives while they are on duty <U+2014> amid heated national discussions on police brutality and shootings. After an officer was killed by a gunman in Harlem last year, then-New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton warned that the U.S. has fostered <U+201C>an anti-police attitude that has grown<U+201D> and that the national dialogue on police-community relations needs to discourage individuals who <U+201C>exhibit anti-police behavior or attitudes.<U+201D> \nLouisiana became the first state to pass a bill that treats acts targeted against police officers as a hate crime. Other states are discussing passing similar laws. It<U+2019>s unclear whether the spike in respect for police will have staying power or if it reflects mostly a reaction to the retaliatory killings against police officers last summer. \nAlthough confidence in police varies among subgroups, majorities of all groups say they have a great deal of respect for their local police. And the percentage of national adults who say they have <U+201C>hardly any<U+201D> respect for local law enforcement remains small.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Jacob G. Hornberger \n source: informationclearinghouse.info \n text: Another U.S. Massacre in Afghanistan By Jacob G. Hornberger\nNovember 08, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" fff \" - The latest massacre of many innocent people by U.S. forces in Afghanistan provides another demonstration as to why it is imperative that the American people stop deferring to the authority of the national security state and demand the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Afghanistan.\nIn a war that has now gone on for 16 years, U.S. forces just killed at least 32 more civilians, many of whom were children. Another 25 people were wounded. Of course, this is on top of all the wedding parties, hospitals, and other victims of U.S. bombing attacks that have brought the death toll from U.S. interventionism in Afghanistan to more than 200,000, not to mention the wounded, maimed, homeless, and refugees. In the last seven days alone, 95 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan and 111 injured.\nHow many of those 30 people, including the children, who are now being buried had anything to do with the 9/11 attacks? It is a virtual certainty that none of them did.\nHow did this latest U.S. massacre occur? Afghan government forces, assisted by U.S. troops, decided to raid a home in a densely populated neighborhood in a village where a Taliban commander was supposedly having a meeting. The soldiers got trapped in a narrow dead-end street, where they began taking enemy fire from surrounding homes.\nSo, what did they do? Naturally, to save their lives, they called in air strikes, which necessarily involved firing missiles into the neighborhood, which killed those 32 people, including children.\nThe U.S. military<U+0092>s position is the standard one: The military regrets the loss of innocent life but, they say, they didn<U+0092>t really have a choice. If they didn<U+0092>t fire the missiles, the U.S. and Afghan troops would be killed. If they did fire the missiles, the innocent people living in the neighborhood would die. Not surprisingly, the military chose to protect the lives of the soldiers at the expense of those innocent people living in the neighborhood.\nBut let<U+0092>s be mindful of an important fact: If U.S. troops had not still be intervening in Afghanistan, there never would have been a U.S. bombing raid on that neighborhood.\nHow do the people who survived the massacre feel about what happened? Not surprisingly, they were chanting <U+0093>Death to America!<U+0094> Americans should think about that the next time there is a terrorist attack in the United States.\nDespite the bombing attack, two U.S. soldiers <U+0097> Captain Andrew Byers and Sgt. First Class Ryan Gloyer <U+0097> were killed in the battle.\nWhat did they die for? No, they did not die protecting our freedom or keeping us safe. That<U+0092>s nothing but pabulum for the families of those two soldiers <U+0097> to make them feel okay about losing their loved ones. fThey died for nothing, the same thing that those 58,000 plus U.S. soldiers died for in Vietnam.\nFreedom and security of the American people have nothing to do with America<U+0092>s 16-year war in Afghanistan. The Taliban are not coming to get us, any more than the North Vietnamese were coming to get us. The conflict in Afghanistan is nothing more than a civil war, one in which one side is battling to oust a regime that has been installed into power by the U.S. government.\nOnce the U.S. presidential race is over <U+0097> a race in which the 16-year-old war in Afghanistan has barely been mentioned <U+0097> the American people need to demand an immediate end to the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan. Continued U.S. interventionism is accomplishing nothing positive and is only pouring fuel on the fire, making matters worse for everyone, including innocent women, children, and others in Afghanistan.\nJacob G.

Hopefully you didn<U+2019>t throw them out, though, as it turns out there might be quite the market for some old tapes.

While some people don<U+2019>t mind or even enjoy these changes, for others, the original cut is worth a hefty price tag.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Corrie Driebusch \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-up-as-oil-prices-rise-1479803109 \n text: The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 19000 for the first time, extending a stretch of milestones for major U.S. stock indexes. The index of 30 companies flirted with the level off throughout the day Tuesday, before closing at 19024. It was Nov. 4 when the blue-chip index last closed below 18000. Since then, a rally following the U.S. presidential election has benefited, in particular, the shares of industrial companies and banks, bolstering the Dow. That has led to an unusual dynamic: the Dow industrials are on track to post a stronger yearly performance than the S&P 500 for the first time since 2011. The stampede into sectors that have lifted the Dow to new heights <U+201C>happened so quickly and so parabolically,<U+201D> said Rob Bartenstein, chief executive of Kestra Private Wealth Services, who added that he was surprised the index hit the 19000 level just weeks after the election. The Dow<U+2019>s late-year surge is also at odds with the index<U+2019>s performance at the start of the year. In January, worries about slowing economic growth in China and its possible spillover effects sent the blue-chip index to its worst-ever five-day start to a year . U.S. economic data have since improved , and investors have re-embraced stocks. The election of Donald Trump also renewed demand for shares of companies tied to economic growth, particularly in the manufacturing sector . Banks also are new stock-market darlings, as investors have bet on loosened regulation under Mr. Trump as well as higher interest rates. All but two of the 24 banks listed on the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has hit a 52-week high since the Nov. 8 election, according to the WSJ Market Data Group. Since Election Day, the Dow industrials were up 3.4% through Monday<U+2019>s close, while the S&P 500 was up 2.7%. Goldman Sachs Group contributed nearly 200 points of the Dow<U+2019>s 624-point gain in that time. <U+201C>People are now thinking the glass is half full,<U+201D> said Jimmy Chang, chief investment strategist at Rockefeller & Co., referring to the stock market<U+2019>s postelection rally. Talk about tax cuts, looser regulation and infrastructure spending are contributing to investors<U+2019> optimism, he added. The Dow industrials are now up 9.2% this year, while the S&P 500 is up 7.8%. On Tuesday, the Dow industrials rose 67 points, or 0.4%, to 19024. The S&P 500 added 0.2% to 2203 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3% to 5386<U+2014>fresh records for all three. Tuesday<U+2019>s gains added to a spate of recent milestones for U.S. stocks. On Monday, the three indexes<U+2014>plus the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks<U+2014> closed at records. The strength in the recent rally belies the lack of clarity about the policy implications of a Trump administration, some analysts say. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s always the danger that you jump to conclusions way too fast because a lot of these expected benefits will take time to pan out,<U+201D> Mr. Chang said. Other possible contributors to stock-market swings could include an acceleration in the recent selloff in bonds, a strengthening dollar weighing on corporate earnings, or the Trump administration enacting protectionist policies that could hurt multinational companies, some analysts and traders said. The dollar<U+2014>which had rallied for 10 consecutive sessions through Monday as investors bet on U.S. growth<U+2014>inched higher again Tuesday. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, rose 0.1% . The dollar also has gained as traders have become all but certain that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise rates next month. Fed funds futures, a popular tool for traders to bet on U.S. interest-rate policy, show a 94% probability that the Fed lifts rates next month, according to data from CME Group . Meanwhile, a postelection selloff in government bonds paused, sending yields lower Tuesday. Investors have dumped long-term government debt as expectations of higher rates and inflation have made assets with fixed returns less attractive. Some of that selling pressure eased Tuesday . The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.319% from 2.335% Monday. That compares with a close of 1.867% on Election Day. Earlier, the Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.2%. The Nikkei Stock Average recovered to close up 0.3%, after falling in response to a 6.9-magnitude earthquake that struck off the eastern coast of Japan early Tuesday. Australia<U+2019>s energy-heavy S&P ASX/200 rose 1.2%, while Hong Kong<U+2019>s Hang Seng Index added 1.4%.

Despite striking an $85.4 billion deal with AT&T Inc. over the weekend, Jeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner Inc., unceremoniously was left out of a release from the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, which said the CEOs of both companies would testify at a hearing on the accord. The reason? The four top Republicans and Democrats leading the Senate Judiciary Committee and its antitrust subcommittee accidentally named Time Warner Cable<U+2019>s former CEO Rob Marcus instead. Time Warner Inc. owns HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. Time Warner Cable, the cable and internet provider that recently sold itself to Charter Communications Inc. <U+201C>Both Randall Stephenson, the CEO of AT&T, and Robert Marcus, the CEO of Time Warner, will testify,<U+201D> the release said. The hearing announcement was sent by Sens. Chuck Grassley, Patrick Leahy, Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar. Shortly after, the Committee sent a corrected news release naming Mr. Bewkes instead of Mr. Marcus. A representative for the Committee said the correct executive was invited to the hearing. It<U+2019>s far from the first time someone has confused the two companies. It<U+2019>s been a bit of a headache for AT&T and Time Warner during the last several dizzying days since they announced their megamerger. Not only have they been clobbered by opposition from politicians including Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, many consumers have tweeted and emailed reporters at The Wall Street Journal confusing the two companies. It doesn<U+2019>t help that Time Warner Cable had a long history as one of the most-hated companies in the U.S. known for its poor customer service. Senior executives at Time Warner were chuckling on Thursday as they read the antitrust committee release. For days, they have suspected that at least part of the backlash stemmed from politicians confusing Time Warner with Time Warner Cable. Earlier this week, AT&T tried to clear up the issue in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. <U+201C>Time Warner Inc. should not be confused with Time Warner Cable, which is a distinct, independent company owned by Charter Communications,<U+201D> the filing explained. <U+201C>In 2008, Time Warner and Time Warner Cable announced a complete legal and structural separation of the companies. That separation was completed in 2009, and the companies have been completely separate and independent entities ever since.<U+201D> Clearly, the lawmakers haven<U+2019>t kept up-to-date with their SEC filings. The Journal earlier this year wrote about how Mr. Bewkes would like to be thought of as the <U+201C>Game of Thrones<U+201D> guy. But to many, he is, unfortunately, the Cable Guy. Mr. Marcus left Time Warner Cable after the Charter deal closed. In an email to this reporter, Mr. Marcus said he <U+201C>didn<U+2019>t know I was invited to D.C. until I read your post.<U+201D> The hearing is slated for Dec. 7 at 10 a.m. in the Judiciary Committee hearing room.

In her own voice, we hear the corrupt Democrat telling reporters that elections can and should be rigged to ensure who wins. This throws the validity of every government on earth in the shredder because she isn<U+2019>t only talking about rigging American presidential elections. \nSince the FBI reopened their investigation into the criminal Democrat and Hillary seeks a powerful position to dictate the lives of others, it<U+2019>s important to hear this audio. She is blatant when she say elections shouldn<U+2019>t take place unless we make <U+201C>sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.<U+201D> \nHear it from her own mouth: \nHillary clearly said, <U+201C>I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. <U+201D> \nThis conversation took place in 2006 during a discussion with Eli Chomsky, an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press. At the time, Hillary Clinton was running for a <U+201C>shoo-in re-election<U+201D> as a U.S. senator. \nHer trip, making the rounds of editorial boards, brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. Her conversation was secretly recorded, and the audio hasn<U+2019>t been released until now. \nAccording to Chomsky, this little audio clip has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. He claims his copy is the only copy and no one has heard it since 2006 <U+2014> until now. Election rigging Democrat, Hillary Clinton \nIt proves she is willing to do whatever it takes to win. With massive amounts of voter fraud already being reported in favor of the most criminal and corrupt politician of our time, in combination with this audio, it<U+2019>s hard to deny that Hillary wouldn<U+2019>t rig the election to win. \nLuckily, Americans are wising up to her disturbing antics. We all saw her cheat during the debates , and the proof came out in leaked emails, thanks to WikiLeaks. \nIt<U+2019>s important to hear this, coming directly from Hillary herself, and we can all tell that it is her voice. We all know she<U+2019>s rigging this election to beat Donald Trump, but she obviously has had her hands in rigged elections before. \nIt is hard to say how many elections across the globe she has influenced or just stolen. Hillary Clinton will stop at nothing to grab even a small amount of power, and she continues to prove she is as corrupt as they come.",

After Mr. Trump called off the meeting, accusing the paper of changing the ground rules, the misunderstanding was cleared up and the president-elect headed to the Times headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. The lunchtime meeting included an off-the-record sit-down with executives followed by an on-the-record meeting with journalists. Mr. Trump started the on-record meeting by saying he respected the Times but complained that its coverage of his campaign had been <U+201C>very rough,<U+201D> according to tweets from reporters in the room that were also posted in a live blog on the Times<U+2019> website. <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve been treated very unfairly,<U+201D> he was quoted as saying. <U+201C>I will say the Times is about the roughest of all.<U+201D> He said he would like to improve his relationship with the paper, as it would make his job easier. The meeting with the Times comes a day after Mr. Trump sat down with senior executives and on-air talent from the major broadcast and cable news outlets at Trump Tower, where he criticized their election and postelection coverage. In the off-the-record meeting on Monday, which was organized by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s staff, he complained about news coverage, including predictions he would lose to Hillary Clinton, but also said he wanted to wipe the slate clean, according to a person familiar with the gathering. In the sit-down with the Times, Mr. Trump was quoted as defending his appointment of media executive Steve Bannon, who previously was executive chairman of the conservative news site Breitbart News, as his chief strategist amid criticism that he holds white nationalist views. <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve known Steve Bannon for a long time. If I thought he was a racist or alt-right<U+2026>I wouldn<U+2019>t even think about hiring him,<U+201D> Mr. Trump was quoted as saying. He defended Brietbart as a successful, more conservative news organization and said he doesn<U+2019>t think he did anything to energize the alt-right movement. Mr. Trump was also asked about climate change, conflicts of interests with his businesses, Israel, Syria and President Barack Obama during the interview. Early Tuesday, it wasn<U+2019>t even clear if the meeting would happen. Before 7 a.m. Eastern time, Mr. Trump tweeted that he called off the meeting <U+201C>with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice.<U+201D> He also tweeted that <U+201C>perhaps a new meeting<U+201D> would be set up and proceeded to criticize the publication for covering him <U+201C>inaccurately and with a nasty tone.<U+201D> The Times responded by saying the ground rules as had been agreed upon the day before<U+2014>in which Mr. Trump would meet with publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and other executives for an off-the-record exchange followed by an on-the-record meeting with journalists and editorial columnists<U+2014>hadn<U+2019>t been changed. Mr. Trump has been a vocal critic of print and TV outlets<U+2014>particularly the Times and CNN<U+2014>throughout his campaign and since winning the election. He has frequently urged his supporters not to trust the mainstream media. Write to Lukas I. Alpert at lukas.alpert@wsj.com and Sarah Rabil at Sarah.Rabil@wsj.com",

Band did not respond to request for comment. \nIn November 2011, according to the memo, the telecommunications company Ericsson agreed to give Bill Clinton $400,000 in private plane travel. The company also paid the former president an additional $750,000 to speak at its conference that month in Hong Kong. \nIt was the largest speaking fee Bill Clinton had received up until that point, and with the added plane fare, the payment reached well over $1 million. \nAlthough Hillary Clinton reported in her disclosure filings that her husband received a $750,000 honorarium for the speech, she did not disclose the additional $400,000 in private plane expenses from Ericsson in the spousal income or gifts and reimbursements sections . \nIn another Nov. 17, 2011 email, Band complained that Bill Clinton was not required to submit an internal conflict-of-interest disclosure form <U+2013> unlike other top officials at the Clinton Global Initiative <U+2013> despite the fact that the former president received <U+2018>expensive gifts<U+2019> for his home from CGI sponsors . Bill Clinton and Doug Band \nBill Clinton <U+2018>does not have to sign such a document even though he is personally paid by 3 CGI sponsors, gets many expensive gifts from them, some that are at home etc,<U+2019> wrote Band. \nHillary Clinton did not disclose any gift or travel expenses that she or her husband received while at the State Department. The federal disclosure form requires officials to report gifts to themselves or a spouse totalling more than $350 from a single source, such as <U+2018>tangible items, transportation, lodging, food, or entertainment<U+2019> and <U+2018>travel-related cash reimbursements.<U+2019> \nHowever, a federal official does not have to disclose gifts to a spouse that are <U+2018>totally independent of their relationship<U+2019> <U+2013> for example, business-related benefits that a spouse receives from his employer. While many of the companies involved in CGI and Bill Clinton<U+2019>s for-profit business had interests before the State Department, government ethics experts said it can be difficult to determine whether a gift to a public official<U+2019>s spouse is connected to their relationship . \nIt is also unclear whether Hillary Clinton travelled on any of these <U+2018>personal trips<U+2019> and <U+2018>in-kind vacations,<U+2019> which Band wrote were given to Bill Clinton<U+2019>s <U+2018>family.<U+2019> The Clintons have a 36-year-old daughter, Chelsea, who is also involved in the Clinton Foundation. \nA spokesperson for Clinton<U+2019>s campaign did not respond to request for comment. \nAccording to the National Legal and Policy Center, a government watchdog group, failure to report certain gifts in a financial disclosure form could violate the Ethics in Government Act or the Federal False Statements Act. \nFederal laws <U+2018>require full disclosure of such expensive gifts and reimbursements when special interests use a spouse to target a government official,<U+2019> said Ken Boehm, chairman of the NLPC. \n<U+2018>The just-disclosed emails of Clinton associate Doug Band that Bill Clinton and his family members benefitted from hundreds of thousands of dollars in free travel and gifts from special interests while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State raises substantial ethical and legal issues because the Financial Disclosure reports filed by Secretary Clinton does not show these expensive gifts and reimbursements,<U+2019> said Boehm. \nDCG",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Robert Fisk \n source: informationclearinghouse.info \n text: The Tales of Bodies and Blood That Surround a Front Line in Syria By Robert Fisk\n The Independent \" - We arrived so soon after Jabhat al-Nusra<U+0092>s retreat from the village that one man and his family had only just buried the remains of four Islamists at the bottom of their field. <U+0093>We found them at the back and they stank so much that we had to get rid of them,<U+0094> Mohamed Kenjo said. <U+0093>So we took the remains and put them under a covering of earth away from our home.<U+0094>\nBut the house he once shared with his wife and six children had been looted <U+0096> everything, from the washing machine and the water tank, to cups and saucers and kettles <U+0096> and the homes of Kenjo<U+0092>s neighours lay in ruins, broken open by shells and rockets. This was the front line north of Hama, a city whose history lay in the blood of insurrection more than 34 years ago.\nSo close to the front line, in fact, that the fighter bombers were still howling over our heads to attack the Islamists <U+0096> Ahrar al-Sham, Nusra, all the usual suspects <U+0096> in the next village to the north-west. The Syrians say you can only see their jets, that the Russian fighter-bombers are so fast it<U+0092>s impossible to catch them with the naked eye. You could make out the spray of anti-missile flares that the aircraft released, four or five bright stars that drifted through the imperial blue sky like fireworks.\nBut then, as the planes turned one after the other from their bombing runs, you could just see them as the sun caught their swept-back wings, daggering up into the heavens to the south before their bombs exploded with a loud, hollow sound like two giant wooden planks banging together on the ground. Amid the soldiers, sweating, tired, a general turned up, steel helmet over his eyes, marching briskly with his officers through the ruins. I wanted to know how many of the Nusra men had died.\n<U+0093>Many, many,<U+0094> he replied. But when I asked how many of his Syrian soldiers had been killed in the broken, smashed village of Soran, his answer came without hesitation. <U+0093>We had 42 martyrs,<U+0092> he said bleakly. I didn<U+0092>t doubt the figure. And when soldiers tell the truth, it means they are winning. But that<U+0092>s a lot of men to lose for one dust-covered hamlet. The Syrian army<U+0092>s death toll in six years of war is a state secret. But I<U+0092>ve been given a reliable figure for the government army<U+0092>s fatalities in this terrible war: around 75,000. These are the dead, not the hundreds of thousands of wounded. Soldiers expect to die. They live by the sword.\nCivilians on both sides are the innocents whose lives should be spared. Their mortality statistics come from all sides, including the United Nations. Is it 250,000 or 300,000 as the UN now states? Or 400,000 as the <U+0093>experts<U+0094> in faraway cities now claim? Whatever the figure, add another 75,000 to it.\nThe ruins of the village of Soran north of Hama (Nelofer Pazira)\nThe Nusra men and their allies had only captured this place two and a half months ago. House after house in what had been Soran had been blown apart. Some remained, their doors ajar, the bougainvillea still spilling over their concrete walls. But always, when I walked inside, there were cupboards torn open by the retreating Islamists, piles of children<U+0092>s clothes and toys and clocks and family snapshots scattered across the floor. One picture showed a baby smiling from a cot, another a husband and wife surrounded by their children. The Islamists had probably been looking for money hidden in the cupboards. But why did the looters want a washing machine? Did they plan to lug this rubbish away in their retreat? What happened to those who lived here?\nThere was no doubt of the tragedy of one middle-aged man. He stood forlornly in the street beside a huge bomb crater surrounded by heavy, jagged pieces of steel casing that lay at his feet. <U+0093>I am a policeman in Hama,<U+0094> he said. <U+0093>My father stayed behind. He was an old man. And on the day they left, the killers murdered him. They shot him at the back of his home.<U+0094> And he led me into his father<U+0092>s blackened house and pushed open the door to a small, darkened closet. <U+0093>We found him there, on the floor,<U+0094> he said.\nOther Syrian villagers, returning now that the Islamists had fled, told similar stories, of missing women, of bodies in the wreckage. Highways seem to survive wars, as if history insists that the basic geography of a society should remain mapped out amid the ruins for a village<U+0092>s later reconstruction. So on the main road, those who had fled the invaders last August had turned up in pick-up trucks and old cars to see what remained of their homes, to collect what detritus was left.\nIn the neighbouring village of Maardes, I found a woman and her daughter <U+0096> her name was Qamar, which means <U+0093>moon<U+0094>, and they had returned to a real moonscape. She and Qamar found part of a wardrobe and a mat carpet which they loaded pathetically onto a pick-up which a relative had brought up from Hama. In a different age, in 1982, the Muslim Brotherhood <U+0096> a pale ghost compared to the Islamists of today <U+0096> had staged a fearful insurrection in the city, put down with more than equal ferocity by Hafez al-Assad<U+0092>s army all those years ago.\nThe statistics of those long dead civilians who had died in the government<U+0092>s reprisals are as slippery as today<U+0092>s death toll. Was it five or six thousand? Or 20,000 as we journalists claimed at the time?\nMany of the ruins of Hama<U+0092>s old city were bulldozed away to make room for new apartment blocks and a luxury hotel. But a few ancient houses remain beside the ancient <U+0093>nouriah<U+0094> water wheels that still wail and creak away in this haunted city. Its Sunni Muslim citizens are quiet now. Maybe they have learned their terrible lesson. Or maybe the government learned to treat them with respect, leaving new generations with their new-found trade and wealth and schools. Today, its market packed with shoppers, it feels like a memory of the old, dubiously <U+0093>safe<U+0094> dictatorship that dominated Syria before this war; content, subdued, careful, aware <U+0096> to use an old British wartime maxim <U+0096> that <U+0093>careless talk costs lives<U+0094>. Brotherhood prisoners back in 1982 were later slaughtered in a prison massacre at Palmyra.\nThe Ibrahim mosque still displays a three-decade old shell hole in its minaret. But Nusra has not let the city forget its past. Less than a month ago, a suicide bomber set off a truck load of explosives outside the Baath party headquarters. One governor has been assassinated. It<U+0092>s a relief to drive north again to a wooded hillside whose burned trees and massive earth revetments show that it was an artillery position until a few days ago. Two 120mm guns stand on a parapet above the plain of Hama.\nOn top of the hill, there stands the almost untouched shrine of Ali Ibn Hussein al-Abdin, the fourth Imam who survived the seventh century battle of Kerbala, a Shiite holy place <U+0096> the Alawi sect to which the al-Assads belong is Shia <U+0096> and soldiers had arrived from the battlefront to pray and kiss the black marble shrine beneath its cupola of antiquity. A major later stood outside the courtyard and pointed to the horizon. You could see 30 <U+0096> perhaps 40 <U+0096> miles across the flat, featureless countryside where around 7,000 armed opponents of the Assad regime are still fighting to retake the lost villages and cut the desert military supply road to Aleppo. Are they all Nusra men? A few Isis members, no doubt. Perhaps they were the <U+0091>moderate<U+0092> rebels whom David Cameron, a former British prime minister seemingly invented.\nAnd how long before the Syrian army could recapture all those lands which ran seventy miles to Aleppo and linked up to the Turkish border north of the city? The major looked across this vast expanse of territory. Then he pointed to the sky and opened his hands. The gesture said it all. Only God knows.",

Youtube screenshot \nSan Diego, CA <U+2014> James Slatic took every precaution possible to ensure his California medical marijuana business was in full compliance with local, state, and federal laws <U+2014> and that appropriate taxes and fees, hundreds of thousands each year, were always paid on time. \nBut despite conducting business professionally and legally, nearly 30 heavily armed San Diego police and DEA agents broke into and destroyed Med-West Distribution, stole all the legal products inside, confiscated his computers and servers <U+2014> and proceeded to clean out his entire family<U+2019>s life savings, including the accounts of his high school and college-aged daughters, and his 84-year-old mother<U+2019>s safety deposit box. \nBy obstinately refusing to acknowledge Med-West<U+2019>s legal status, law enforcement used highly contentious federal civil asset forfeiture (CAF) law to rob the Slatics of everything they<U+2019>d earned <U+2014> including $324,000 in proceeds from the lucrative medical cannabis business, according to the Institute for Justice (IJ). \n<U+201C>This case is not about crime fighting,<U+201D> IJ attorney Wesley Hottot, who now represents the Slatics, explained. <U+201C>This case is about policing for profit, and it illustrates the abusive power of civil forfeiture at its worst.<U+201D> \nAs countless families and individuals around the country have been shocked to learn, the State can rob you blind, taking everything of value <U+2014> bank accounts, vehicles, electronics, and even houses, etc. <U+2014> without proof any crime has been committed. \nJames Slatic has never been convicted or charged with any wrongdoing in the matter <U+2014> but the nightmare of civil asset forfeiture doesn<U+2019>t end with a lack of charges or conviction. In fact, attempting to reclaim property and cash can be a nightmare of red tape, court appearances and legal fees <U+2014> and, even then, isn<U+2019>t always a successful venture. And like so many others, Slatic had not been familiar with this legal, policing-for-profit scheme prior to his firsthand encounter. \n<U+201C>I<U+2019>ve done nothing wrong,<U+201D> he told the Institute for Justice. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s beyond frustrating that my family<U+2019>s money was taken without any criminal charges being filed. My wife and teenage daughters had nothing to do with my business whatsoever, and the District Attorney took their college savings accounts. This is not just wrong; it is unconstitutional.<U+201D> \nWhile he certainly might be right, CAF is federal law <U+2014> a brief reprieve in January, when the Department of Justice suspended the program, only lasted through early April <U+2014> because the ability of police to steal people<U+2019>s stuff and either use it or the proceeds from its sale is just too damned profitable. \nIndeed, police and other agencies <U+2014> particularly the Drug Enforcement Agency <U+2014> make a killing in this legalized State robbery sham, and many departments have come to rely on CAF profiteering to bolster their funding. \n<U+201C>Civil forfeiture is one of the greatest threats to property rights in the nation,<U+201D> said IJ attorney Allison Daniel, also representing the Slatic family. <U+201C>Civil forfeiture takes the American principle of innocent until proven guilty and flips it on its head, treating property owners worse than criminals by making them prove their innocence.<U+201D> \nAt 7:30 in the morning on January 28, 2016 <U+2014> as surveillance cameras outside and inside Med-West captured on video <U+2014> the San Diego Joint Narcotics Task Force used a sledgehammer to break down the door of Slatic<U+2019>s legal business, and stormed in, pointing automatic weapons at the heads of innocent employees inside. \nNeedlessly and recklessly, around 28 officers took everything of value inside, destroying and scattering property in the process. \nAs Slatic told IJ, in addition to assets stolen from the business, the greedy cops cleared family bank accounts of over $100,000 <U+2014> leaving his daughters scrambling to pay for school supplies, like college textbooks, while putting their tuition and fees in jeopardy. \nAnnette Slatic, James<U+2019> wife, who works as a nurse at the Veterans Administration, found out about the raid and financial seizure when she tried to pay for groceries that morning and had her card declined. Then her daughter, Penny, a high-schooler, tried to pay using her ATM card <U+2014> and was also declined. Without notice, the Slatics suddenly found themselves essentially penniless and unsure how to afford basic needs. \nNow they<U+2019>re fighting to get everything back, since under California law, <U+201C>probable cause<U+201D> a crime has been committed must be established before officers can use civil asset forfeiture to seize property and cash. \nAs the Institute for Justice explains, <U+201C>Because police and prosecutors ignored Med-West<U+2019>s status as a legal marijuana business, they did not have probable cause to seize the Slatics<U+2019> money. Even if Med-West had been an illegal operation (and it was not), the Slatics<U+2019> personal money is not connected to the business.<U+201D> \nPerhaps the Slatics will have better luck in getting justice than innumerable others who have been unfortunate enough to be victims of legalized robbery. \nDespite massive controversy surrounding the program <U+2014> and one of its creators now denouncing the policing-for-profit scheme it has become <U+2014> civil asset forfeiture won<U+2019>t be going anywhere soon. \nWhile some states have severely curtailed cops<U+2019> ability to take your stuff, by implementing strictures requiring a conviction and similar limits, others have taken CAF to new levels. Oklahoma Highway Patrol began using a device called an ERAD , which scans bank and prepaid cards <U+2014> right from a person<U+2019>s wallet <U+2014> to seize all cash in an individual<U+2019>s account during a traffic stop if an officer even suspects a person of committing a drug-related offense. \n<U+201C>Three decades ago, I helped create our civil asset forfeiture system,<U+201D> wrote Brad Cates in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal , <U+201C>now it<U+2019>s time to end it.<U+201D> \nThis is what it<U+2019>s like to run a legal business, pay taxes, and follow the law in a Police State: \nThis is free and open source originally appearing on the Free Thought Project.

Additions to the collection on Thursday included three short email exchanges between Mr. Podesta and Mr. Obama himself in the days leading up to his election in 2008. Mr. Podesta<U+2019>s emails were first published by WikiLeaks earlier this month. The release came just days after James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, and the Department of Homeland Security publicly blamed Russian officials for cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee, in what they described as an effort to influence the American presidential election. To date, no government officials have offered evidence that the same Russian hackers behind the D.N.C. cyberattacks were also behind the hack of Mr. Podesta<U+2019>s emails, but an investigation by the private security researchers determined that they were the same. Threat researchers at Dell SecureWorks, an Atlanta-based security firm, had been tracking the Russian intelligence group for more than a year. In June, they reported that they had uncovered a critical tool in the Russian spy campaign. SecureWorks researchers found that the Russian hackers were using a popular link shortening service, called Bitly, to shorten malicious links they used to send targets fake Google login pages to bait them into submitting their email credentials. The hackers made a critical error by leaving some of their Bitly accounts public, making it possible for SecureWorks to trace 9,000 of their links to nearly 4,000 Gmail accounts targeted between October 2015 and May 2016 with fake Google login pages and security alerts designed to trick users into turning over their passwords. Among the list of targets were more than 100 email addresses associated with Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s presidential campaign, including Mr. Podesta<U+2019>s. By June, 20 staff members for the campaign had clicked on the short links sent by Russian spies. In June, SecureWorks disclosed that among those whose email accounts had been targeted were staff members who advised Mrs. Clinton on policy and managed her travel, communications and campaign finances. Two security researchers who have been tracking the GRU<U+2019>s spearphishing campaign confirmed Thursday that Mr. Podesta was among those who had inadvertently turned over his Google email password. The fact that Mr. Podesta was among those breached by the GRU was first disclosed Thursday by Esquire and the Motherboard blog, which published the link Russian spies used against Mr. Podesta. <U+201C>The new public data confirming the Russians are behind the hack of John Podesta<U+2019>s email is a big deal,<U+201D> Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s senior policy adviser, said Thursday. <U+201C>There is no longer any doubt that Putin is trying to help Donald Trump by weaponizing WikiLeaks.<U+201D> The new release of Mr. Podesta<U+2019>s email exchange with Mr. Obama from 2008 made clear that Mr. Obama<U+2019>s team was confident he would win. In one of the emails, Mr. Podesta wrote Mr. Obama a lengthy memo in the evening on Election Day recommending that he not accept an invitation from President George W. Bush to attend an emergency meeting of the Group of 20 leaders. <U+201C>Attendance alongside President Bush will create an extremely awkward situation,<U+201D> the memo said. <U+201C>If you attempt to dissociate yourself from his positions, you will be subject to criticism for projecting a divided United States to the rest of the world. But if you adopt a more reserved posture, you will be associated not only with his policies, but also with his very tenuous global standing.<U+201D> The White House did not respond to questions about the email. Correction: October 22, 2016 An article on Friday about suspected email hacking by Russia<U+2019>s foreign intelligence service misstated the name of one organization that first disclosed that a presidential counselor, John D. Podesta, was among those whose accounts were breached. The blog is Motherboard, not VICE Motherload. Nicole Perlroth reported from San Francisco, and Michael D. Shear from Washington.

Last year, the State Department tipped off the Clinton campaign that a New York Times reporter was digging into her email scandal. The State Department had claimed that they had not worked to help Clinton during the whole corrupt mess. Guess what? They lied. \nMike Schmidt is the reporter that broke the original story on the Hildabeast using a private email account and a home brewed server.

The State Department should go under immediate review and heads should roll over this. What blatant corruption. \nFrom The Daily Caller: \nThe State Department tipped the Hillary Clinton campaign off last year that a New York Times reporter was asking questions about Clinton<U+2019>s emails. \nThe revelation undermines the State Department<U+2019>s claims that it has not worked to help Clinton during the ongoing email scandal. \n<U+201C>State just called to tell me that Mike Schmidt seems to have what appear to be summaries of some of the exchanges in the 300 emails the committee has,<U+201D> Nick Merrill wrote in a March 14, 2015 email . \nSchmidt is the Times reporter who broke the news that Clinton used a private email account as secretary of state. The article was published on March 2, 2015. Clinton had turned more than 50,000 emails over to the State Department in Dec. 2014. The State Department then provided around 300 emails to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which was chaired by South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy. \nThe emails seem to indicate that Clinton<U+2019>s team suspected Trey Gowdy of leaking the contents of Clinton<U+2019>s emails to Schmidt. <U+201C>Again, it appears that he does not have the email but that someone, likely from the committee, is slipping him cherry-picked characterizations of the exchanges,<U+201D> Merrill wrote. <U+201C>I haven<U+2019>t heard directly from Schmidt yet but will circle back when I do.<U+201D> Other Clinton campaign officials were not pleased with the news.

Another email sent days before Schmidt published his first bombshell report on the Clinton emails, shows that Democrats on the Benghazi Committee also tipped off the Democrat<U+2019>s team that the reporter was snooping around. There<U+2019>s not a damned one of these Democrats that have any honor. Not one. <U+201C>Talked to [Clinton attorney Heather Samuelson] late afternoon aand [sic] told her I<U+2019>d heard from Dem Staff Director on Benghazi Select Comm that NYT was sniffing around, maybe to do a story on State production to Committee or on our production to State,<U+201D> Clinton lawyer David Kendall wrote on Feb. 28th, 2015. \n<U+201C>I<U+2019>d gotten a call from NYT<U+2019>s Mike Schmidt (very young) about 2:00 pm<U+2013>said nothing on background or on record. I didn<U+2019>t feel he had anything, but. We may get a further inquiry from him over weekend.<U+201D> This indicates to me that these idiots had no idea how big the NYT<U+2019>s story would be. \nKendall also wrote that Schmidt attempted to get him to hand over copies of Clinton<U+2019>s emails that had already been produced for the Benghazi Committee. <U+201C>He knew that some of the HRC dox had been produced <U+2014> wasn<U+2019>t sure if they all had been. He knew that State had asked other former SOS<U+2019>s for their emails but didn<U+2019>t know what the response was. I couldn<U+2019>t tell what his likely angle was (and even if he had one),<U+201D> Kendall wrote. \nThis isn<U+2019>t the first time there has been dirty dealings between the State Department and other government agencies with Team Clinton.

The plans to boost presence in the Baltic States and Poland were approved at the bloc<U+2019>s Warsaw summit in July but the issue of strengthening Black Sea presence was hung in the air. The idea of forming a \"Black Sea Fleet\" did not materialize. \nThis time the defense chiefs agreed to significantly boost allied forces specifically in that region. The US, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Turkey indicated their willingness to contribute. Other countries are also expected to join. Romania and Bulgaria will host an increased air force presence, designed to undertake surveillance missions over the Black Sea. Starting next year, Romania also hopes to head a multinational force there. The UK, Canada and Poland will send aircraft to be based in the Romanian southeastern Mihail Kogalniceanu air base. \nRomania, Bulgaria and Turkey are also expected to come forward with a plan to increase naval and air patrols in the area by the beginning of 2017. The US supports the Romania<U+2019>s initiative to establish a multinational naval brigade in the region. The plans on enhancing Black Sea presence will be finalized during another meeting of NATO<U+2019>s defense ministers in February. The proposals on two basic elements for the maritime component <U+2013> a strengthened training framework and a coordination body for the Black Sea that reports to the specialized NATO command <U+2013> are expected to be submitted for consideration by that time. \nSofia and Bucharest would work together and define their takes on the increased NATO deployment in the Black Sea by December. With the naval brigade on the agenda, Bulgaria has agreed to participate with 400 troops in the multinational brigade in Romania. The unit is intended to facilitate the flow of forces throughout the region. \nAccording to Doug Lute, US ambassador to NATO, that amounts to a new land presence in NATO<U+2019>s southeast. Romania calls for a regular trilateral format of joint naval exercises in the Black Sea, along with Turkey and Bulgaria, with the eventual participation of non-littoral NATO members. US servicemen conduct periodic training exercises on Romanian and Bulgarian firing ranges. \nNATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said Georgia and Ukraine will be fully involved in the plans. According to him, <U+00AB>It is important to have close contact with partner countries like Ukraine and Georgia<U+2014>being non-NATO members but NATO partners<U+2014>and to dialogue with them regarding our increased presence in the Black Sea<U+00BB>. \nIn September, US and Bulgarian aircraft launched joint regular patrols in the Black Sea. The patrolling mission greatly increases the risk of an accident, especially with the Russian S-400 long range systems stationed in Crimea. \nA NATO naval task force permanently deployed in the Black Sea will require non-Black Sea states to rotate their ships every 21 days, raising the cost of the operation, in line with the provisions of the Montreux Convention (1936). Bulgarian, Romanian, Ukrainian and Georgian navies can hardly make a significant contribution. It will put on the agenda the need for major NATO seafaring members hand over some of their own warships to them. One of the ideas under consideration is reflagging some NATO naval assets under the three Black Sea members<U+2019> flags to boost permanent naval capabilities in the theater. Politically, bringing together NATO and non-NATO ships together under one operational control is a highly provocative step towards Russia. \nUS destroyers and cruisers visit the Black Sea from time to time to provide NATO with long range first strike capability. The Romania-based BMD system uses the Mk-41 launcher capable of firing Tomahawk long range precision-guided missiles against land assets. \nThe NATO<U+2019>s decision to beef up its presence in the Black Sea comes just four months after it unveiled the deployment of 4,000 soldiers to the Baltic republics and Poland, backed up by a rapid reaction force of some 40,000 troops capable of reaching the region in days. Romania already hosts a ballistic missile defense (BMD) with the plans under way to have another operational BMD system deployed on Polish soil in 2018. \nThe NATO plans are doomed to be counterproductive bringing more escalatory than deterrent value. They will inevitably provoke Russia into taking measures in response. The Black Sea will become a region of uncontrollable arms race. For instance, with the NATO Aegis Ashore BMD system deployed, Romania has become a target for Russia<U+2019>s military as it had been warned. \nRather symbolically the announcement of the plans coincided with the news that Russia launched on October 26 Veliky Novgorod super-stealth submarine capable of striking land, sea and underwater targets - the latest addition to Russia<U+2019>s Black Sea Fleet. Kolpino - another Varshavyanka-class submarine <U+2013> will be launched in November. \nThe Russian territory is protected by Russia's Bastion-P (K-300P) anti-ship coastal defense missile systems equipped with Onyx missiles. \nThese Mach 2.6 supersonic missiles are highly maneuverable, difficult to detect and have a range of nearly 300 kilometers. With the help of the Monolith-B radar station, the system is capable of obtaining over-the-horizon target designation many miles beyond the horizon. The long range cruise missile capable Su-24 supersonic attack aircraft are already deployed in Crimea. By deploying a naval group to the Black Sea, NATO puts it at risk. \nThe militarization of the region against the background of high tensions is a very negative trend. An accident may spark a big fire. The just announced NATO plans testify to the intention of NATO<U+2019>s leadership to turn the Black Sea into a \"NATO lake\" permanently patrolled by a naval task flotilla with air cover in the proximity of Russian border. The October 26-27 NATO defense ministers<U+2019> meeting illustrated the fact that the alliance is shifting to a Cold War-era security framework . \nThe decision to militarize the Black Sea will make Russia and NATO balance on the brink of conflict instead of joining together in the fight against terrorists - the common enemy. The costly effort will require a lot of time and effort to make the world less safe.",

[1] Source: Friends of the Earth \nTiffany Finck-Haynes, food futures campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said: \n<U+201C>U.S. food retailers must take responsibility for how the products they sell are contributing to the bee crisis. \nThe majority of the food sold at top U.S. food retailers is produced with pollinator-toxic pesticides. We urge all major retailers to work with their suppliers to eliminate pollinator-toxic pesticides and to expand domestic organic offerings that protect pollinators, people and the planet.<U+201D> [1] Organic Offerings And Transparency Are Lacking \nThe report <U+201C>Swarming the Aisles: Rating Top Retailers on Bee-Friendly and Organic Food<U+201D> is the work of a coalition led by Friends of the Earth and more than 50 farmer, beekeeper, farmworker, environmental, and public interest organizations. [1] \nThe coalition sent a letter urging food retailers to eliminate pesticides that are toxic to bees and other pollinators , and increase U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) certified organic food and beverages to 15% of overall offerings by 2025. The group would like to see retailers prioritize domestic, regional, and local p<U+00AD>roducers. \nFriends of the Earth and its allies have been successful in the past at convincing more than 65 garden retailers, including Lowe<U+2019>s and Home Depot, to commit to eliminate pollinator-toxic neonicotinoid (neonic) pesticides. \nAccording to Haynes, the demand for organic foods has grown by double-digits , but grocers aren<U+2019>t keeping up. She said: \n<U+201C>A lot of the major food retailers have started to increase their organic offerings, but few of them have really adopted clear goals or metrics to continue to significantly increase their organic food offerings in the future.<U+201D> [2] \nAs evidenced by the group<U+2019>s research, it<U+2019>s difficult for the public to know where retailers stand concerning pesticide use and organic food. Eleven of the 20 retailers<U+2019> websites examined by Friends of the Earth don<U+2019>t provide basic information concerning their policies on organic food, pollinators, and/or pesticides , Haynes said, adding: \n<U+201C>There<U+2019>s a lot that retailers could do by adopting creative programs with their supply chain to help farmers grow their organic offerings, and then be able to sell that in their stores.<U+201D> Americans Are Ready For Change \nA YouGov poll released 25 October 2016 by Friends of the Earth and SumOfUs reveals that 80% of Americans believe neonics should not be used in agriculture , and 65% of those who do the grocery shopping for their household would be more likely to shop at a store that has made a formal commitment to eliminate neonicotinoids. [1] \nAdditionally, the poll shows that 59% of respondents believe it<U+2019>s important for supermarkets to sell organic food. Another 43% said they<U+2019>d likely spend more time at a different grocery store if it sold more organic food than the store they currently frequent. \nSaid Angus Wong, lead campaign strategist at SumOfUs, a consumer watchdog with ten million members: \n<U+201C>Over 750,000 SumOfUs members have spoken out advocating that U.S. Hardware stores take action to protect our pollinators. And after years of pressure, Home Depot and Lowe<U+2019>s have finally enacted more bee-friendly policies. \nAnd the findings of this poll show that a vast majority of consumers want to eliminate neonicotinoids from their grocery stores too. This is why food retailers must commit policies that protect our bees immediately.<U+201D> \nOnly four of the nation<U+2019>s top food retailers <U+2013> Albertsons, Costco, Target, and Whole Foods <U+2013> have adopted and made public a company-wide commitment to increase offerings of certified organic food . They are also the only retailers to disclose data on the current percentage of organic food they offer, or organic sales. \nAldi, Food Lion, part of the Delhaize Group, and Kroger disclosed data on the current percentage of organic offerings or organic sales. \nNone of the retailers that the group looked at have publicly committed to sourcing organic food from American farmers . Retailer Apathy Is Killing Pollinators \nOf the top 20 food retailers surveyed by Friends of the Earth, a shocking 16 were predominantly unresponsive to Friends of the Earth<U+2019>s requests for information via surveys, calls, and letters. The group was forced to turn to publicly available information, including company websites, company annual reports, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports, press coverage, and industry analyses, for their data. \nWe have bees to thank for every 1 in 3 bites of food we take ; and without bees, stores would run low on everything from strawberries to almonds. Source: Bee Cause \nScience increasingly points to neonicotinoid pesticides as a leading cause of pollinator decline. Glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto<U+2019>s blockbuster herbicide, Roundup, has been shown to play a significant role in monarch butterfly declines . \nSeveral U.S. cities have banned neonics, including Boulder City, Colorado , and Portland, Oregon .

A new poll conducted for POLITICO by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that only 36 percent of likely voters want to overturn the long-standing ban on Medicaid paying for abortion with federal funds. But among self-described Clinton voters, 57 percent support scrapping the current rules. Story Continued Below Federal funding for Planned Parenthood, in contrast, has considerable bipartisan support, by an approximately 3-to-2 ratio. That<U+2019>s despite the strong Republican drive to cut off its funds, nationally and in many states. That was fueled by undercover videos released in the summer of 2015 that purported to show some clinics illegally selling fetal tissue <U+2014> an accusation that Planned Parenthood denied. Not seeing the podcast? Click here to listen on Soundcloud and click here to subscribe on iTunes. The ban on federal funding of most abortions, known as the Hyde Amendment after the late anti-abortion Rep. Henry Hyde, has been on the books for 40 years. Democrats have grudgingly accepted it as a kind of compromise on abortion. But during this year<U+2019>s presidential campaign, that changed. Clinton, who has made defending reproductive rights a cornerstone of her candidacy, and other prominent abortion-rights supporters have said the time has come to end Hyde. They argue that the ban unfairly prevents low-income and minority women from accessing a basic form of women<U+2019>s health. Under Medicaid, abortion funding is banned except in cases of rape, incest and threat to the mother<U+2019>s life. Some states use their own funds to cover abortion in certain circumstances but more often if a Medicaid recipient seeks an abortion, she must pay for it herself. The push to repeal the Hyde Amendment <U+2014> a policy rider Congress attaches to spending bills every year <U+2014> could rally Clinton<U+2019>s base and propel her to fight for it if she wins the presidency, even though congressional Republicans (and probably some moderate Democrats) would block it. Robert Blendon, a Harvard professor of health policy and political analysis who conducted the poll, says that if Clinton is elected, her supporters are going to want her to make progress on women<U+2019>s health <U+2014> and progress means more than protecting the status quo on reproductive rights. <U+201C>She put this in [the platform] because activist Democrats care about it and if she wins, it<U+2019>s not enough to say, <U+2018>We<U+2019>re not going to defund Planned Parenthood,<U+2019><U+201D> Blendon said. <U+201C>She has to make some positive step.<U+201D><U+2019> If the Hyde Amendment is divisive, Clinton<U+2019>s support for federal funding for Planned Parenthood has strong bipartisan support among likely voters. Fifty-eight percent favor ongoing funding, while 37 percent want to end it. Surprisingly, self-described Trump voters are evenly split <U+2014> 48 percent want to keep funding Planned Parenthood and 47 percent want to end it. Clinton voters are much more supportive: 70 percent are in favor of continued funding and 26 percent want to cut it off. <U+201C>For the majority of Americans, Planned Parenthood isn<U+2019>t a political talking point, it<U+2019>s where people get their health care,<U+201D> said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. <U+201C>Right now in this election we<U+2019>re seeing the last gasp of an outdated agenda to attack women<U+2019>s health and rights.<U+201D> Lawmakers in the next Congress may have to contend with both Planned Parenthood funding and attempts to repeal Hyde. Efforts to defund Planned Parenthood have failed several times, but Republican leaders <U+2014> if they maintain control of the House or Senate <U+2014> could revive that effort to please their base. Hyde's repeal has not faced a recent vote in either chamber. While liberals may love to see Clinton push to undo Hyde, moderates may be reluctant to take that on. And conservative groups that oppose abortion have already started a counter-offensive, indicating that Republicans would try to vote it down. Among Trump voters, 77 percent want to maintain current policy while 19 percent oppose it. If Clinton does push for repeal of Hyde, it could squeeze moderate Democrats, especially in the Senate, where many of them are up for reelection in 2018. House Democrats have introduced a bill to repeal the Hyde Amendment with 124 co-sponsors <U+2014> all Democrats. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said she<U+2019>s confident that as more people learn what the Hyde Amendment does, support for repeal will grow. <U+201C>It has been a long-term fight but we have some phenomenal young people in our country who are working day and night to turn this around,<U+201D> she said on the 40th anniversary of the Hyde Amendment last month. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s not going to take us another 40 years to win this.<U+201D> Overall, abortion remains divisive, the POLITICO/Harvard poll found. About one-quarter of all likely voters say it is extremely important to their pick for president. But for Republicans, it<U+2019>s more salient. Republicans count abortion as one of their top health care concerns in choosing for whom to vote. However, abortion for Republican voters trails behind the future of the health care law, the government<U+2019>s role in slowing the rise of health costs and Medicare. Democrats count Medicare as their top concern, followed by five other issues before abortion. Women (67 percent) were much more likely than men (46 percent) to say that abortion policies are extremely or very important to their presidential pick. The POLITICO Pro-Harvard poll was conducted by independent research company SSRS from Sept. 14-21 among a nationally representative sample of 1,492 likely voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Not seeing the podcast? Click here to listen on Soundcloud and click here to subscribe on iTunes.

You<U+2019>d think that in the winter when there are no crops to tend or hay to mow, there may be some time to take a break, and that<U+2019>s somewhat true, but not really. \nWinter is actually one of the busiest times of year; in addition to taking care of the animals, clearing snow, and keeping things running, you need to plan and prep for the next year. \nWinter appears to be a time of sleep and relaxing by the fire, but for a homesteader, there is no such thing. If you have cows to milk and chickens to feed, then you still have to take care of that. Then there are all of the other tasks that you have to do: clearing the roof, bringing in firewood, making impromptu repairs. \nWinter is a great time of the year to make a plan for what you need to do in the spring, summer, and fall to make your homestead successful. \nWe<U+2019>ve put together a calendar of things to do in the winter to help make your homestead successful all year round. \nCheck your Stockpile \nWinter is a great time to check your stockpile for several reasons, but the primary reason that we<U+2019>re adding it to the calendar is so that you can decide what to plant in the spring. \nIf you<U+2019>re running out of green beans but still have a ton of corn, you can adjust your crops accordingly. Plant more beans and less corn. The same thing goes for canned meals and condiments. If you<U+2019>ve just about eaten all of your beef stew and salsa but still have a ton of chicken soup left, adjust accordingly. \nYou can also determine whether you<U+2019>re best using your crops. Say you had a bumper crop of apples and made pie filling, applesauce, apple cider vinegar , and apple butter. Now you<U+2019>re out of pie filling but still have 32 quarts of applesauce. It seems like you may want to adjust how you use your apples next year. \nMake a chart and record your findings so that you can compare to last year and make your adjustments. You don<U+2019>t want to use your entire stockpile. \nIt<U+2019>s good to have enough for a couple of years, but you don<U+2019>t want to can 6 months<U+2019> worth of apple butter and 5 years<U+2019> worth of okra, especially two years in a row. \nConcentrate on Your Herbs/Winter Crops \nI don<U+2019>t know about you but I love herbs. They<U+2019>re great for adding flavor, and for using medicinally. Since they<U+2019>re easy to grow inside , you can grow them year round. Since you<U+2019>re likely slam busy all summer and fall, wait until winter to harvest and store your herbs. This is a good time to make your essential oils and medicinal blends , too. \nIf you live in a moderate climate, you may be able to grow some winter crops such as garlic, kale, carrots and potatoes during the winter. They<U+2019>re easy to grow and won<U+2019>t take up hardly any time. Search the internet for crops that will grow in the winter according to your zone . \nThere are also early spring edibles that you can start growing and have ready to eat while you<U+2019>re waiting on those peppers and tomatoes to grow. \nStart Your Seeds \nIf you live in a zone where you have short summers and you want to grow crops that have a long growing period, start them inside as early as February. That way, you<U+2019>ll have healthy seedlings or young plants to transplant when the weather warms up. Your garden will have a great start before the snow is even off the ground! \nMake a To-Do List for the Coming Months \nPlan your summer. Sit down and make charts of what you<U+2019>re going to plant, how much of it you<U+2019>re going to plant, and where you<U+2019>re going to plant it. Keep in mind soil types and compatible plants when you<U+2019>re making your chart. \nThink about your animals. Do you want to breed? Do you need more eggs? Did you put back enough meat this year? Are your chickens cramped and need a new coup? How about the barn <U+2013> does it need repairs? Is the tractor running rough? Do you need any new equipment? Make a list by month of all these projects that you need to address. \nPlan Your Expenses \nNow that you<U+2019>ve sat down and planned your crops and equipment repairs and made a list of other things that you do, then plan how much you<U+2019>re going to need to spend versus when you<U+2019>ll need it and when you<U+2019>ll have the money to do it. Try to project any equipment replacements or repairs that you<U+2019>ll need, too. Remember to allow for any unexpected expenses. \nYou don<U+2019>t have to stop with just the next year. Do a five-year plan, then adjust as needed. Keep adding a year every winter. This will really help keep you on track as long as you actually refer back to the list and follow it as much as possible. \nMake Syrup \nIf you live in an area where you have birch or maple trees, late winter is when you can gather the sap from the trees and make your syrup for the year. Just FYI, it<U+2019>s a bit of work to make, but it<U+2019>s free and you can sell it for a great profit. That<U+2019>s assuming your family doesn<U+2019>t make you keep it! \nDo all of the in-house repairs. Think about those creaky stairs, unpainted rooms, loose carpets and wobbly stools that you<U+2019>ve been meaning to fix all summer. Now<U+2019>s a great time to get all of that stuff done so that you can check it off the list. Video first seen on TacticalIntelligence . \nHelp Your Animals Adapt \nWinter affects different animals in different ways. Chickens will likely slow down production when the weather changes. You can head this off a bit by making sure that they<U+2019>re snug and warm, but make sure that the coop stays well-ventilated. Keeping your hens happy will make your breakfast a happy event, too. \nCows and horses, on the other hand, may need to be fed more so that they have enough energy to stay warm and (in the case of cows) keep producing quality milk. If you<U+2019>re new to homesteading study up on your animals before winter so that you<U+2019>ll know what to do to keep your animals safe and healthy. \nWinter is definitely a bit slower than the rest of the year, but there are plenty of things that you can do to maintain and improve your farm. Relaxing a bit isn<U+2019>t a bad thing, either <U+2013> you work your buns off the rest of the year, so give your brain and your body a break. \nHave Some Family Time \nFarms are a ton of work and though we all squeeze in <U+201C>together<U+201D> time while we work, cleaning out the chicken coop together just isn<U+2019>t the same as picking up a Redbox or heading out for pizza and an evening of fun. There<U+2019>s so much work to be done in the other months that it<U+2019>s easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle and forget to have some fun. Now<U+2019>s your chance! \nEducate Yourself \nWinter is a great time to use your mind instead of your back. Farming, homesteading, sustainability, and prepping are ever-changing beasts, so take the downtime to catch up on the latest news and ideas that are available all over the net. \nFeel free to go old-school and buy some books and magazines to get some new ideas about how to move your farm forward. Think about planting guides, new equipment, new prepping ideas, or ways to help keep your animals healthy naturally. \nAnother good subject to study up on is the plants that you<U+2019>re growing. If you don<U+2019>t know all about each plant that you grow, take this time to learn. Not all plants like the same types of soil. Some like rich, loamy soil, some like sandy soil. Some grow great next to each other and others, such as tomatoes and potatoes, shouldn<U+2019>t be grown together. \nJust knowing these small facts will increase your yield and even improve the quality and flavor of your crops. \nIf you have anything else to add to the winter calendar to-do list,   \nWe can all learn from each other, but never forget the ways our forefathers made their own food, harvested their own plants and made their own medicines to survive during gloomy   1 total views, 1 views today",

Specifically, a population explosion that will cause eventual food shortages? I am told that procreation is a very macho thing for the Mexican male. You have even mentioned in the past that men do not perform oral sex on women because it<U+2019>s not important when having children. How does that way of thinking weigh in with regard to the future of the planet? \nEl Blanco Pedro \nDear Pedro Gabacho:Malthus called<U+2014>he wants his crackpot theory back. Besides, the gabacho love of suburbia proved far more toxic to the environment than any 12-child Mexican mom ever did, so vete a la chingada con your faux environmental concern. \nOPEN LETTER TO OUR NEW PRESIDENT: Gentle cabrones: as I write this, the Mexican still doesn<U+2019>t have a feel for whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump (or neither?) will be the next president of the United States (The Mexican has to file his columna a week before actual publication<U+2014> viva dead-tree journalism). In the interest of not looking more pendejo than usual, I will write three open letters to ensure I get the results right. Enjoy! \nTO PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON: Congrats on beating that pendejo Trump<U+2014>you<U+2019>re now the greatest female savior of Mexicans since the original Santa Sabina, the legendary curandera for which the goth-Mex band was named. But that<U+2019>s not enough. Do not inherit the title of Deporter-in-Chief from Obama. Realize that the only reason you won is because raza overwhelmingly voted for you<U+2014>and we want results besides appointments of token vendidos (although do give a cool gig to Congressman Xavier Becerra, a truly down Chicano). Don<U+2019>t pay attention to all the Know Nothings who insist on enforcement before amnesty. There<U+2019>s millions of Mexicans who have lived their entire lives in limbo, and it<U+2019>s your job to save them. And if you do that? We<U+2019>ll create a new altar to you at Tepeyac. \nTO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Congrats on beating that pendeja Killary<U+2014>you<U+2019>re now the greatest unifier of Mexicans since Porfirio Diaz. Don<U+2019>t even try to deport 12 million people, or build that nasty, small-handed wall. Back in the day, raza mostly stood meekly as everyone from Presidents Hoover to Roosevelt to Eisenhower to Obama enacted mass deportations<U+2014>but those were honorable men. You<U+2019>re not. We will protest, we will resist, we will struggle, we will take over elected offices the way Irish took over Boston. You hear me, President Pendejo ? We ain<U+2019>t no sleeping giant<U+2014>we woke, and we<U+2019>re ready to make your one-term more pitiful than Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto.

She Drank a Gallon of Water/Day for a Month and Now She Looks 10 Years Younger Sufficient daily water intake is vital for virtually every function within our bodies yet fewer than... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/she-drank-gallon-of-waterday-for-month.html Sufficient daily water intake is vital for virtually every function within our bodies yet fewer than one in five of us drinks enough. Read on to see the results of this experiment. Sarah Smith is a 42 year old mother of two young kids in the UK. She, like many others, openly admitted to not drinking the recommended 2 to 3 liters of water daily. She suffered from poor and sluggish indigestion and regular headaches. Following consultations with medical professionals for both issues she decided to take heed of the advice given <U+2013> in both cases she had been told that she needed to up her intake of water . She decided to document and photograph what happened in a self imposed experiment whereby she would drink 3 liters, just over 5 pints, of water per day, every day for an entire month and see if she could feel any benefits.At the outset Sarah took a long hard look at her face noting that: <U+201C>I am 42, but have to admit I look more like 52 in this picture, which is shocking. There are dark shadows under and around my eyes, which make me look exhausted, a profusion of wrinkles and strange reddish blotches, and my skin lacks any lustre. It looks dead<U+2026> even my lips look shrivelled.<U+201D> She spread the water out during the day aiming to drink a big jug of water in the morning, another in the afternoon with a third in the evening.At the end of the FIRST WEEK she had already noticed that her bowel function was improved and her urine was virtually clear as the water was flushing out her previously dehydrated poorly functioning kidneys. She noticed sudden skin breakouts, which were a result of the toxins being eliminated from throughout her body. However, her headaches were already gone and her previous joint stiffness first thing in the morning was vastly improved. Water is vital for lubricating the joints. WEEK TWO saw an improvement in her skin tone and general complexion although she noted that her eyes were still wrinkled but said <U+201C>they look less crepey and shadowy than before<U+201D>. She also had a visibly flatter stomach and her smart husband paid her the ultimate compliment by noting that her cellulite had vanished! Significantly she had another week headache free.On to WEEK THREE when Sarah was happy to find that her eye wrinkles and dark circles had all but disappeared and her skin was plumper and healthier looking.She noted that she was actually eating less by this stage as she had fallen into the common trap of reading signals from her stomach as being hunger pangs whereas they were actually thirst pangs. Research has shown that 37 per cent of people actually mistake thirst signals for hunger signals. The plentiful water had now stopped her from continually falling into that unhealthy trap.So what about the end of WEEK FOUR ? Sarah said: <U+201C>I genuinely can<U+2019>t believe the difference in my face. I look like a different woman. The dark shadows around my eyes have all but disappeared and the blotches have gone. My skin is almost as dewy as it was when I was a child. The transformation is nothing short of remarkable.<U+201D> She was leaner, fitter and nobody can deny the astonishing change to her appearance. She changed nothing else in her daily routine apart from the water intake. To those already of you already converted to drinking enough water these results will merely confirm what you already know, but to anyone who is guilty of not doing so, will this persuade you to try this for yourself? Alexander : Since we have addressed the miraculous rejuvenating power of water, here is one more mind-blowing fact. According to Gregg Prescott of In5D.com , he was able to restore his hair's original color after only six months of drinking distilled water . In his own words: \"In August of 2010, I was 2 months away from turning 50 and my hair was predominantly gray, with pronounced lines around my eyes. This is when I began to be conscientious about my eating habits and started eating more organic food, although I was still eating processed food as well. I began drinking distilled water in February 2012. By August of 2012, my hair had turned from gray back to its original color and the facial lines were not as pronounced.\" And the results are fantastic! Here's a before and after comparison: You can buy a good quality water distiller from Amazon for about $200, which is not that much considering the benefits.

Credit: Alan Hilditch / flickr)\nDemocracy grants people the right to protest, to show their opinion on matters that affect their lives and their nation<U+2019>s. Protesting is a universally acknowledged fact belonging to the modern world. It serves to give voice to those who are disturbed by the faulty policies, drawbacks and negligence of their governments and who wish to raise public awareness on these matters. Demonstrations, rallies, strikes, pickets, boycotts and so on are all ways of protesting. As long as they are within the limits defined by the <U+201C>law,<U+201D> protests and acts of similar nature are in essence an indisputable part of democracy, freedom of opinion and expression.\nHowever, in some cases protesting is exploited and used as a means of opposing democracy itself. Protests that give way to riots are now methods of staging coups to shut down administrations and overthrow democratically elected governments.\nLegitimacy of Protests and Feasibility of Demands\nDemocratic protests are welcomed by societies and addressed by governments to the extent that their demands are tangible, justified and feasible . Protests lacking those qualities are most likely to fail in having their demands met.\nThe anti-government movement in Bulgaria in 2013-14 confirmed the validity of these qualities. The protests took place in three separate cycles. January and February witnessed rallies that objected to the high prices of electricity and demanded the government resign. They were successful as the requests were sensible. A later demonstration was against a government officer, and resulted in his resignation. Yet another cycle of protests called for a change of the system, along with some other illegal demands and faced defeat after turning into riots that were not supported by the overall society.\nMORE... Gruesome Video Shows Turkish Soldiers Execute Female Kurdish PKK Fighters by Shooting in Their Heads 2 bombers, stopped by police, blew themselves up in Turkey Dispute over Kurds and Coup attempt threatens U.S.-Turkey alliance The attempted coup d<U+2019><U+00E9>tat made Turkey band together The Gezi Park protests in Turkey in the same year followed the same pattern. Set in motion with a good willed and environmentalist approach, it was likely to succeed considering its solid and feasible calls and legitimate ways at first. The government heeded the nature lovers<U+2019> voices and took a positive step by postponing a construction project that required the destruction of Gezi Park. Yet the humanist approach of young people changed course in the wake of provocations of separatist and terrorist gangs and turned into a totally different nature. Demonstrations that began in Gezi Park in Istanbul and that demanded the preservation of Gezi Park as a recreational area spread to other cities of the country and transformed into armed and bloody uprising imposing the fall of government. It was a quite clear coup d<U+2019>etat attempt that did not refrain from using violent methods and openly rejected the validity of a democratically elected government. The protests were contradictory considering people took to streets using their democratic rights, but then appealed to non-democratic methods to lay their claims ignoring the will of the nation.\nThough justified at the beginning, these two cases of protests demonstrate that they are open to hostile manipulations and may lose their legitimacy if left at the hands of ill-minded people. Recently some dark powers have been using this latest technique to manage countries<U+2019> internal affairs as they see fit and stage coups to overthrow governments. They bring in professional teams of brutal killers amidst peaceful protests, which then lead to violent anti-democratic clashes. These protests sometimes end up in civil wars where fellows of the same nation kill one another. It all happens in the wake of a government<U+2019>s non-yielding to some dark power<U+2019>s demands and a democratically elected government faces anti-democratic attempts.\nMethods of Provocations and OTPOR\nSuch dramatic outcomes come by the employment of social media. Social media becomes an instrument for organizing, stirring and agitating the masses that are presumed to join the demonstrations. Various provocative organizations undertake the organization of some agents and provocateurs who take part in demonstrations by inciting them to get violent. These illegal <U+201C>subcontractors<U+201D> organize the public relations part of the riots and channel intellectual circles of the country such as its authors, academicians, journalists and members of non-governmental institutions to act against democratically elected government in the name of democracy and to lead the public.\nOne of the most common groups among these <U+201C> professional revolutionary organizations <U+201D> is a Serbia-based resistance organization,OTPOR . Independent observers state that OTPOR organizes coup attempts and civil disturbance by providing training and logistic support for the US-backed dissident organizations in many countries such as the former Yugoslavia, Serbia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Egypt, Brazil, and Turkey. There is a consensus that the CIA has been creating riots and social disturbances in fifty countries OTPOR its offshoot CANVAS<U+2026>\nA relevant source puts forward the following interesting findings OTPOR :\nThe (OTPOR 's ) fist-logo, would turn up 11 years later in the streets of Cairo , illustrating further the preposterous, foreign-backed nature of the Egyptian uprisings... Serbia<U+2019>s OTPOR would continue receiving funds from the West and become a <U+201C>CIA-coup college<U+201D> of sorts under the name of CANVAS (Center for Applied Non-Violent Action and Strategies ).\nThe research article penned by Carl Gibson and Steve Horn and published on <U+201C>Occupy.com<U+201D> deals with the international financial, intelligence and political connections of OTPOR and features the following information based on WikiLeaks documents:\nSerbia<U+2019>s Srdja Popovic is known by many as a leading architect of regime changes in Eastern Europe and elsewhere since the late-1990s , and as one of the co-founders of OTPOR<U+2026> Popovic and OTPOR's offshoot CANVAS have also maintained close ties with a Goldman Sachs executive and the private intelligence firm Stratfor as well as the U.S. government <U+2026>\nSuch examples are easy to find. The internal public opinion on OTPOR is that it is being employed as leverage to overthrow those governments which conflict with the interests of the U.S. No wonder some media organizations that act on behalf of the US administration speak highly of OTPOR at every turn. Moreover, the British media rigorously advocates that the executives of OTPOR have nothing to do with the organization of coups.\nLikewise, some Turkish media organizations disseminated similar statements during the 2013 Gezi Park demonstrations. The attempt to occupy the Prime Minister<U+2019>s residence by armed groups, which is an act of rebellion against the state and treason by law, was orchestrated by OTPOR, according to reports. Yet the media deliberately defined it as <U+201C>the exercise of legitimate, democratic rights, and freedom of expression by the people,<U+201D> and thus desired to create misapprehension to display the members of the Marxist and separatist terrorist organizations who are far from representing even a slightest portion of the nation as the representatives of the nation. These media organs called the nation<U+2019>s security forces who risked their lives to preserve public order and people<U+2019>s lives as <U+2018>the so-called enemies of freedom and democracy.<U+2019>\nIn truth, such mass demonstrations that aim to topple governments, divide countries and organize bloody conflicts - and even civil wars - can no longer be called innocent rallies, but subtle projects of deep states and shadow organizations to take over countries from within.",

But several recent WikiLeaks emails from John Podesta, chairman of Hillary<U+2019>s campaign, have revealed that Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s health problems cannot possibly be branded as <U+201C>conspiracy theories<U+201D> any longer.\n\nBefore Hillary Clinton announced her run for president, an email sent on March 14th, 2014, by campaign manager Robert Mook to Clinton campaign chairman Podesta asks whether Podesta has discussed Hillary<U+2019>s <U+201C>taxes and health.<U+201D> The email states that he acknowledges they<U+2019>re both <U+201C>hyper sensitive<U+201D> issues, wondering whether <U+201C>both are better dealt with very early so we control them<U+2013>rather than responding to calls for transparency.<U+201D> \nIn this thread, Mook stated <U+201C>Yes. We need to kill that baby in the cradle.<U+201D> (Which perfectly articulates how sadistic the Clinton campaign and agenda is within a single metaphor.)\nA later email thread from July 31, 2015 , shows Dan Schwerin, Clinton<U+2019>s director of speech writing, aiming to roll out Hillary<U+2019>s tax records along with a letter from her physician stating that she is <U+201C>in excellent health,<U+201D> and that following this <U+201C>We expect the stories that pop at 2 pm to have headlines such as <U+201C>CLINTON IN <U+2018>EXCELLENT HEALTH,<U+2019> MEDICAL RECORDS SAY<U+201D> <U+2026> <U+201C>CLINTON RELEASES HEALTH REPORT<U+201D> <U+2026> <U+201C>CLINTON CAMP AIMS TO ONE-UP BUSH IN DISCLOSING FINANCES<U+201D>\nThe emails expose the Clinton campaign<U+2019>s attempts to suppress any further inquiry into these health problems and control the narrative, and provide them with <U+201C>the best possible, <U+2018>fighting<U+2019> chance of promoting the most helpful story lines.<U+201D>\nAlso stating that <U+201C>the first stories on health won<U+2019>t pop until 2. 1 pm is just when we will quietly approach the reporters, <U+201D> the Clinton camp is exposed in the way in which the mainstream media has held complete bias in favor of a Clinton presidency. This has also been revealed through all the recent Podesta email Wikileaks releases. Just one example being an email sent April 30, 2015, by Politico reporter Glenn Thrush, who even called himself a <U+201C>hack<U+201D> when asking Hillary<U+2019>s top campaign aide, John Podesta, to check over sections of his report regarding the Democratic presidential candidate before publication. \n\nStartlingly, an email exchange between Hillary<U+2019>s campaign leaders, Tanden and Podesta, even questions if she is aware that we are living on planet Earth. Telling an audience in Ohio that she was <U+201C>moderate and center<U+201D> after previously stating just a few days prior that she was <U+201C>progressive<U+201D>, Tanden asks, <U+201C>Why did she call herself a moderate?<U+201D>\nPodesta replied <U+201C> I pushed her on this on Sunday night. She claims she didn<U+2019>t remember saying it. Not sure I believe her.<U+201D> \nIn response, Tanden stated, <U+201C>I mean it makes my life more difficult after telling every reporter I know she<U+2019>s actually progressive but that is really the smallest of issues. It worries me more that she doesn<U+2019>t seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment. <U+201D> \nIt can be speculated as to what this statement is referring to, but it is evident that this proves Hillary<U+2019>s lack of awareness and mental stability. Perhaps regarding her inability to hold a firm political position, or even more worryingly, her inability to retain even the most basic and fundamental information, due to a medical condition that she is suffering from. Giving credibility to the latter possibility, Hillary<U+2019>s top aide Huma Abedin admits that the former Secretary of State is <U+201C>still not perfect in her head,<U+201D> in a newly revealed Wikileaks email on Tuesday.\nCountless incidents capturing Hillary<U+2019>s poor health and unstable mental state have been brought to light, despite the Clinton campaign and mainstream media<U+2019>s attempted censoring of this content in the hope that portraying a false narrative regarding these episodes will stray attention away from this issue. For example, after Hillary<U+2019>s recent fall at a 9/11 memorial event filmed by a bystander, the Clinton campaign tried to cover up by claiming this was due to <U+201C>pneumonia and dehydration<U+201D> even though Clinton does not appear limp, as though she has fainted. In contrast, she appears ridged and shaky throughout this episode, as Secret Service agents lift her into the vehicle. However, Hillary<U+2019>s constant tumbles do not surprise me, as the gravitational force pulling this Democratic nominee towards underworld must be so incredibly strong.\nThis along with many other recently recorded accounts of Hillary<U+2019>s severe coughing fits , dangerous falls, recurring eye problems , and the spitting up of a vile yellow substance, have undoubtedly shown that this presidential candidate is scarcely physically fit to perform duties as president. Hillary<U+2019>s mental state is also a major point of concern, which top aides, Podesta and Abedin, have confirmed through the Wikileaks emails stated in this article.\nIf Hillary blatantly appears unable to function healthily during her time running for president, we can only expect these issues to increase in severity if she were to take on the stressful position of president.\nThe post WikiLeaks Podesta Emails Confirm Hillary<U+2019>s Health Issues appeared first on We Are Change .\n",

        "input": "time: null \n author: TRIP GABRIEL \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/us/politics/ivanka-trump.html?_r=0 \n text: IVYLAND, Pa. <U+2014> When Donald J. Trump is in trouble with women voters, he has often called on his daughter Ivanka, an executive and entrepreneur as smooth as he is rough-hewed, as calming as he is potentially alarming. Ms. Trump had attacked the <U+201C>false narrative<U+201D> of her father<U+2019>s misogyny on television a month ago, and she declared in the spring that he was <U+201C>not a groper<U+201D> in response to a New York Times account of his treatment of women. It was Ms. Trump, 34, who persuaded her father to add child care support to his policy proposals. Ms. Trump returned to the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since the emergence of a recording of Mr. Trump vulgarly describing how he liked to grab women by the genitals and force kisses on them. On a carefully stage-managed swing through the Philadelphia suburbs, Ms. Trump avoided mentioning the 2005 recording or a series of accusations by women who said the Republican nominee had gone beyond braggadocio to active groping. Metaphorically, there was a storm raging outside, but inside a series of ballrooms, at events billed as <U+201C>coffee with Ivanka,<U+201D> Ms. Trump answered nonchallenging questions from supporters about favorite memories of attending college in Philadelphia (<U+201C>great restaurants<U+201D>) and her top campaign trail moments (<U+201C>those primary wins<U+201D>). Her audiences were mainly active volunteers for the Trump campaign, and the news media was kept at a distance as Ms. Trump was whisked in and out of her appearances. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s been an amazing experience,<U+201D> she said in response to a typical audience question about what it was like to campaign with her father and siblings. The events <U+2014> one each in four suburban counties <U+2014> had a serious political purpose: to rouse and inspire the volunteers in the closing weeks of the presidential race. The Hillary Clinton and Trump campaigns know the Philadelphia suburbs are very likely to determine the electoral fate of Pennsylvania on Election Day. And a new Bloomberg Politics poll that coincided with Ms. Trump<U+2019>s swing held brutal news: Mrs. Clinton was walloping Mr. Trump in the Philadelphia suburbs by 28 percentage points, driving a nine-point lead for the Democratic nominee statewide. Suburbanites, the survey showed, have reached harsh judgments on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s remarks on the recording. More than two of three likely voters in the poll said they were bothered a lot by the comments, including three of four women. Still, the activists who turned out for Ms. Trump on Thursday dismissed her father<U+2019>s words and were skeptical of the women<U+2019>s accounts, including one by a former People magazine reporter who wrote that Mr. Trump pushed her against a wall and forcibly kissed her during a visit to his estate in 2005 for an interview. <U+201C>Why are they digging things up from 11 years ago?<U+201D> asked Annette Patchell, the owner of a small business here in Bucks County. <U+201C>And these women that are coming out of the woodwork, why now only four weeks before the election? It seems a little odd.<U+201D> Lee Henry, a paralegal waiting in line to hear Ms. Trump, said, <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t buy it at all,<U+201D> referring to the accusations. <U+201C>Where were all these women then?<U+201D> She sought to change the conversation to <U+201C>why Hillary likes open borders,<U+201D> accusing a brother of Mrs. Clinton of maintaining a warehouse full of green cards to be used to grant permanent resident status to illegal immigrants. Alice Buehler, a retiree who made phone calls for Mr. Trump over the weekend, said that she had thought that the emergence of the recording would suppress the number of volunteers. <U+201C>It was more crowded than ever,<U+201D> she said.

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: truthdig.com \n text: ( IMDb ) \nThe first two movements of the movie <U+201C>Moonlight,<U+201D> Barry Jenkins<U+2019> lyrical account of one young man<U+2019>s passage to adulthood, shatters the soul into sharp-edged shards. The third section of this unique triptych, Jenkins<U+2019> adaptation of Tarell Alvin McCraney<U+2019>s play , <U+201C>In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,<U+201D> rearranges these fragments in a way that makes its characters<U+2014>and viewers<U+2014>whole. \nThis coming-of-age story is all the more singular because it is a serious film by African-Americans, one that employs the familiar tropes of black poverty and underemployment, and yet defines its characters not by the struggle against the racism, drug addiction or incarceration that limit them, but by the humanity that elevates them. This distinguishes it from other compelling recent films such as <U+201C>12 Years a Slave<U+201D> and <U+201C>The Birth of a Nation,<U+201D> which contend with the hopelessness of slavery. \nThe place: the northwest Miami enclave of Liberty City . The time: the 1980s, perhaps not so long after white police officers have been acquitted of beating to death a black youth. One afternoon, Juan ( Mahershala Ali ), a dealer during this period when crack is replacing pot and heroin as the drug of choice, sees a small schoolboy running from his pursuers, who taunt each other to <U+201C>get his gay ass!<U+201D> \nThe undersize 9-year-old, Chiron (played by the watchful Alex Hibbert), takes cover in an abandoned building from which Juan extracts him. The older man takes Chiron to the modest home he shares with Teresa ( Janelle Mon<U+00E1>e ). For those who know Hollywood movies, this is particularly fraught. Is Juan planning to recruit Chiron as a sex partner, a drug runner, or <U+2026>? \nJuan is a dealer, but that<U+2019>s not all he is in this movie, which refuses to reduce characters to fit convenient pigeonholes. Juan is also a supremely empathic father figure who looks out for and protects this stripling. \nStill, for Chiron, nicknamed <U+201C>Little,<U+201D> the world is a brutish place that diminishes people who are different. While at first Chiron is almost mute, after a meal he quietly asks Juan what the word <U+201C>faggot<U+201D> means. \nWisely, Juan blames Chiron<U+2019>s victimizers: <U+201C> <U+2018>Faggot<U+2019> is a word used to make gay people feel bad,<U+201D> he says. When Chiron asks, <U+201C>Am I one?<U+201D> Juan shrugs and replies, <U+201C>You could be gay, but you don<U+2019>t got to let people call you a faggot.<U+201D> Despite Juan<U+2019>s excellent advice, Chiron will let his mother ( Naomie Harris , in a devastating turn) and his baiting schoolmates call him just that. The only time Chiron is not on what appears to be emotional lockdown is with a schoolmate named Kevin, as outgoing as Chiron is introverted. \nJuan does not teach Chiron to fight back. Nor, in the calm blue waters off of Miami Beach, does the older man send the boy the message that life is a matter of sink or swim: He teaches Chiron to float. The moment Chiron ceases to navigate the world burdened with fear and humiliation and experiences zero gravity, his weightlessness is transcendent. \nOn a moonlit evening when Chiron is a teenager (now played by wiry, wary Ashton Sanders), he finds himself on that same beach, silent but for the plash of gentle waves. While in most encounters Chiron retreats from others, this night he approaches Kevin. They talk. Another moment of ecstatic weightlessness. Another glance at the fluidity of masculinity. \nThough there are moments of violence and betrayal in <U+201C>Moonlight,<U+201D> Jenkins quietly achieves something that more didactic filmmakers cannot. In this film, with minimal plot and dialogue, he brings his camera up close to his characters. Without telling us how to feel, he gives us the space to feel Chiron<U+2019>s inner thoughts. The result is a movie that, like the scene of Juan teaching Chiron how to float, is a baptism by hope.",

When pushed to say whether he had ruled out prosecution of Mrs. Clinton, he said:<U+00A0><U+201C>It<U+2019>s just not something that I feel very strongly about,<U+201D> according to comments published by the Times . In the interview, Mr. Trump also said he disavowed the so-called alt-right movement, which has been tied to racism and anti-Semitism. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s not a group I want to energize. And if they are energized, I want to look into it and find out why,<U+201D> he said to the Times. Asked about a video that showed white nationalists gathered in D.C., he said: <U+201C>I disavow and condemn them.<U+201D> In other comments, Mr. Trump said he has an <U+201C>open mind<U+201D> on whether to pull the U.S. out of an international climate accord. On his business dealings, he said that when it comes to conflicts of interest, <U+201C>the law<U+2019>s totally on my side, the president can<U+2019>t have a conflict of interest.<U+201D> He added:<U+00A0><U+201C>In theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly.<U+201D> Earlier, a top aide said Mr. Trump wouldn<U+2019>t push for prosecutors to investigate Mrs. Clinton for her email practices or the operations of the Clinton Foundation . <U+201C>I think when the president-elect, who<U+2019>s also the head of your party, tells you before he<U+2019>s even inaugurated that he doesn<U+2019>t wish to pursue these charges, it sends a very strong message, tone and content<U+201D> to others, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said on MSNBC. Mr. Trump, during one of three debates with his Democratic rival, had said he would direct the attorney general to launch an investigation of Mrs. Clinton, whom he regularly referred to as <U+201C>crooked Hillary.<U+201D> He said repeatedly that she should be in jail, and his supporters often yelled <U+201C>lock her up<U+201D> at his rallies. <U+201C>If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,<U+201D> he said during a debate in October. Mrs. Clinton couldn<U+2019>t immediately be reached for comment. In the days after the election, he showed signs of wavering, telling The Wall Street Journal in an interview that he hadn<U+2019>t decided how to proceed. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s not something I<U+2019>ve given a lot of thought, because I want to solve health care, jobs, border control, tax reform,<U+201D> he said at the time. The Federal Bureau of Investigation probed Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s email practices, which involved the use of a personal server while serving as secretary of state, and didn<U+2019>t pursue charges . It concluded she and her aides were <U+201C>extremely careless<U+201D> in handling sensitive information but that <U+201C>no charges were appropriate.<U+201D> Mr. Trump repeatedly said on the campaign trail that Mrs. Clinton broke the law. During the second presidential debate, he said that she should be <U+201C>in jail.<U+201D> Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign trail rhetoric was widely criticized for violating longstanding norms in politics against politically motivated prosecutions of rivals. Decisions about prosecution are made by the Justice Department without White House involvement to ensure that political considerations aren<U+2019>t a factor and to preserve the independence of prosecutors. Some Republicans in Congress have said they intend to continue pursuing Mrs. Clinton. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) after the election said his <U+201C>task No. 1 is to get what are literally tens of thousands of documents out of the State Department.<U+201D> The Trump campaign<U+2019>s statements could complicate the confirmation process of his attorney general pick , Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.), who will likely be pressed by Democrats about what conversations, if any, he has had with Mr. Trump about Mrs. Clinton.

Mayor Errick D. Simmons of Greenville said that firefighters, responding to a call around 9:15 p.m., discovered the Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church <U+201C>engulfed in flames.<U+201D> Fire Chief Ruben Brown said the blaze took about an hour to fully extinguish. The church sanctuary was heavily damaged by heat, fire and smoke, he said. By Wednesday evening, Mr. Brown said investigators had concluded that the fire was <U+201C>definitely arson<U+201D> after discovering <U+201C>some type of solvent or flammable substance<U+201D> inside. And Police Chief Delando Wilson said a <U+201C>person of interest<U+201D> was being interviewed by authorities <U+201C>to see if this person was an active participant in this crime, or to rule them out from being a participant.<U+201D> The 200-member church has been a fixture for more than 110 years in Greenville, a Mississippi Delta city of about 32,000. <U+201C>Our hearts are broken but are not angry,<U+201D> Carolyn Hudson, the church pastor, said at a news conference called Wednesday by city officials. <U+201C>But hearts are broken, and we are saddened by what has happened.<U+201D> No one was injured in the attack. At the news conference, Chief Wilson said the episode was being investigated as a hate crime. <U+201C>We feel that the quote that was placed on the church was basically, it<U+2019>s an intimidation of someone<U+2019>s right to vote whatever way they choose to vote,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>So that would be definitely considered a hate crime.<U+201D> But <U+201C>as far it being a racial issue,<U+201D> he added, <U+201C>I can<U+2019>t say that.<U+201D> The F.B.I. office in Jackson, the state capital, released a brief statement saying that it was <U+201C>working with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners to determine if any civil rights crimes were committed.<U+201D> The state fire marshal and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also assisting with the investigation. Mississippi<U+2019>s secretary of state, Delbert Hosemann, said Wednesday that he had been in contact with <U+201C>authorities in Greenville<U+201D> and the state Highway Patrol about the attack. Those discussions led him to believe that the burning and vandalism were not committed by <U+201C>somebody of a political nature,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>The initial work here indicates this is not of a political nature even though there may be something that says <U+2018>Vote Trump<U+2019> on the side of the church,<U+201D> said Mr. Hosemann, a Republican. <U+201C>So everybody needs to calm down here until we get to the bottom of this.<U+201D> In a Wednesday evening phone interview including the mayor, the fire chief and the police chief, Mr. Simmons said none of them had been in contact with Mr. Hosemann or his staff about the matter. Mr. Wilson said investigators were keeping all possible motives on the table. The attack occurred a little more than two weeks after a local Republican headquarters in Hillsborough, N.C., was firebombed , and graffiti were discovered with a swastika and the message <U+201C>Nazi Republicans leave town or else.<U+201D> No one has been arrested in that attack. It also follows months of racially charged campaign speech from Donald J. Trump , the Republican presidential nominee. Though Mr. Trump has portrayed himself as a friend of African-Americans and has vowed to make their lives better, he has garnered the support of many white supremacists and white nationalists. Some of his supporters have darkly predicted riots and even revolution if he loses to his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, on Tuesday. His campaign this week disavowed support from The Crusader, a Ku Klux Klan newspaper. Mr. Trump is heavily favored to win in Mississippi, a state where about 60 percent of the population is white. At the news conference, Mayor Simmons, an African-American, called the racial climate in Greenville <U+201C>fairly good,<U+201D> though he noted a racial slur had been found painted on a boat ramp Sept. 11. Like much of the Mississippi Delta, Greenville has struggled economically and has worked to overcome the legacy of slavery. In the mid-20th century, as African-Americans struggled to integrate the Deep South, church bombings were among the ugliest acts of retaliation by recalcitrant white racists. Greenville today is about 20 percent white and 78 percent black, and the public schools are virtually all black. But Mr. Simmons noted that blacks and whites now pray together every fifth Sunday as part of an event he created. The mayor said he visited church members Wednesday. <U+201C>I talked to folks who were fearful,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>I talked to people who were intimidated. I talked to people who, quite frankly, were saddened and crying last night. This should not happen in 2016. It happened in the <U+2019>50s. It happened in the <U+2019>60s. But we<U+2019>re in 2016.<U+201D> In a separate phone interview on Wednesday, the mayor said race relations in the city had not really changed with the rise of Mr. Trump. But he blamed the Republican candidate for coarsening the national mood, and said extremists were using his remarks <U+201C>as an excuse to show their true colors.<U+201D> Also on Wednesday, about three dozen people gathered in a park along the Greenville waterfront to pray and speak about healing and the primacy of faith over politics. Joining a Methodist preacher, an Episcopal priest and a synagogue president in the cool of the night was Alice Washington, a member of Hopewell. <U+201C>We had good church on Sunday,<U+201D> she said, saying it had been some time since she remembered such a good service. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve been trying to figure out who would do something like this to our church,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>Whoever done it, may God bless them.<U+201D> Campbell Robertson reported from Greenville, and Richard Fausset from Chapel Hill, N.C. A version of this article appears in print on November 3, 2016, on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Black Church Is Burned in Mississippi, With <U+2018>Vote Trump<U+2019> Scrawled on Side.

Produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, it drew nearly 100,000 views per day and more than 1,000 viewer comments, with the overwhelming majority expressing support for Williams and outrage at the Clintons for not being willing to allow a DNA test to determine paternity. \nSign the precedent-setting petition supporting Trump<U+2019>s call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton! \n<U+201C>My YouTube account has been deleted, but the same video appears in 50 other places on YouTube alone,<U+201D> Williams said on his Facebook page after being notified of YouTube<U+2019>s decision. <U+201C>[YouTube] can<U+2019>t handle the truth! Please share #BillClintonSon.<U+201D> \nTwitter also continues to allow Williams to post the <U+201C>Banished<U+201D> video on Danney Williams<U+2019> page , but the Twitter link to YouTube displays the message : <U+201C>This video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated. Sorry about that.<U+201D> \nThe video is still running on Danney Williams-Clinton<U+2019>s Facebook page , as well as on the YouTube channel operated by Gilbert. \nAttempt to silence Danney Williams? \nGilbert told WND he helped Williams file an online appeal form on YouTube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated. \n<U+201C>The behavior of YouTube/Google in suspending Danney<U+2019>s account is outrageous! There have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any YouTube terms or guidelines,<U+201D> Gilbert said. \nHILL AND BILL EXPOSED AS <U+2018>PARTNERS IN CRIME<U+2019><U+2013> $4.95 TODAY ONLY! $21 discount on No. 1 New York Times bestselling author<U+2019>s brand-new election blockbuster. \nGilbert was outspoken in charging YouTube with partisan political motives for the suspension. \n<U+201C>The only possible explanation is that the Clinton campaign requested YouTube/Google to silence Danney, <U+2018>to run him off the plantation<U+2019> as Danney said Hillary Clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the Arkansas governor<U+2019>s mansion in 1990,<U+201D> Gilbert said. \n<U+201C>Danney cannot be silenced any longer,<U+201D> he continued. <U+201C>Hillary may try to sweep Danney Williams under the rug, but it<U+2019>s not going to work this time. His story is out there, and every day more and more people understand Bill and Hillary Clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin.<U+201D> \nSee the Danney Williams video feature: \nWND reported Oct. 19 that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate, attorneys for Williams were in Las Vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. \nAccompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating Williams that went viral on the Internet. \nThe mask is off!

Just as O<U+2019>Keefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud Oct. 13, Twitter shut down his account , claiming violations of <U+201C>Twitter Rules.<U+201D> The notice said he <U+201C>must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules, which prohibit: harassing other users, threatening other users, disclosing other users<U+2019> private information<U+201D> or violating <U+201C>other rules.<U+201D> In a statement, O<U+2019>Keefe said he relies on social media to <U+201C>bypass the media and directly reach the public.<U+201D> On Monday, O<U+2019>Keefe wrote in a tweet Project Veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to YouTube, calling the apparent block <U+201C>bizarre.<U+201D> Earlier this month, O<U+2019>Keefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a Hillary Clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day. His account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hidden-camera video that exposed a Clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns, the Daily Caller reported . Project Veritas posted an undercover video Oct. 17 proving Hillary Clinton supporters were inciting violence at Donald Trump rallies to gain negative media coverage. Millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours, but it didn<U+2019>t show up on Google<U+2019>s <U+201C>trending<U+201D> list on YouTube, which Google owns, noted SilenceisConsent.net . It did, however, trend on Twitter, which Google does not own. Breitbart blogger Milo Yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by Twitter minutes before his <U+201C>Gays for Trump<U+201D> party at the Republican National Convention. For some 11 months, the makers of the new movie <U+201C>I<U+2019>m Not Ashamed,<U+201D> about the first victim of the Columbine killers in Colorado in 1999, were unable to promote their movie through YouTube.

But investors also are putting their money on the shares of train, truck and shipping companies, betting on an acceleration in U.S. economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average<U+2019>s surge to 19000 has been accompanied by an even sharper rise in freight operators<U+2019> shares. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, a 20-company index that includes shippers and air carriers, has climbed 7% since the election, ahead of the Dow industrials<U+2019> 3.7% rise to fresh highs. <U+201C>The transportation average often is a leading indicator for the economy,<U+201D> said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird. <U+201C>If we get everything in gear, it suggests everything is in harmony to the upside.<U+201D> Many investors consider transportation stocks a proxy for the health of the U.S. economy because those companies carry the raw materials and goods that power manufacturing and construction. That has led some to say gains in transport stocks could signal new heights for major indexes still to come. Bets that a Republican-controlled government would enact policies that could boost growth and inflation have lifted stocks in general and spurred selling in bonds. Hopes for an infrastructure build-out have also accelerated gains in transportation stocks, which rose ahead of the Dow industrials even before Election Day. After a sluggish first half, the economy is showing signs of strength toward the end of the year. Existing home sales rose in October for the second consecutive month to the fastest pace since February 2007, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of U.S. output, accelerated at its fastest pace in two years in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said last month. The Dow transports signaled improvement back in September, when they broke higher than the Dow industrials. Other factors have bolstered shares of shippers. A record autumn grain harvest and rising exports have boosted railroad operators, increasing shipments around 6.5% this year, according to the American Association of Railroads trade group. CSX Corp. , the U.S.<U+2019>s third-largest railroad operator, said grain shipments increased 27% in the third quarter compared with a year earlier. Its shares have gained 9.2% since the election. Airlines have also been rising sharply since before the election, with the major carriers continuing to signal they will cut capacity to help lift ticket prices and revenue to counter rising fuel and labor costs. The postelection rally has helped accelerate gains, with United Continental Holdings Inc. up 17% and Delta Air Lines Inc. up 9.8%. Some investors said the gains in could mark a new leg up for the U.S. stock market. <U+201C>Now you<U+2019>re sort of resetting the clock here because you<U+2019>ve had such significant outperformance by the transports,<U+201D> said Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at Leuthold Weeden Capital Management in Minneapolis, which has long owned airline stocks. Peter Stournaras, portfolio manager of the BlackRock Large Cap Series Funds, said he is holding on to his transportation stocks. And parts of the transportation sector are concentrated in the U.S., leaving them poised to benefit if Donald Trump and Republicans cut taxes and regulation as proposed. <U+201C>These are very high-tax-rate companies, so any benefit there significantly increases the value of their future cash flows,<U+201D> he said. Markets have responded to the Republican sweep of the U.S. government by pricing in almost all of their policies, as if all campaign promises are about to become policy, several analysts and investors said. Any distance between campaign-trail rhetoric and actual legislation could be setting stocks up for a fall. <U+201C>Given the fundamentals we<U+2019>re seeing in the market, the stocks are pricing in a high success rate for infrastructure not only passing, but happening right away,<U+201D> said Andrew Davis, an analyst at T. Rowe Price. <U+201C>That should give you pause.<U+201D> Investors also watch the transportation stocks because of a theory that suggests their movements predict the direction of the broader index. The Dow Theory holds that the transports should touch new highs each time the industrials hit a new high to confirm the market<U+2019>s upward trend. The Dow industrials closed at a record Monday. The transportation index remains below records reached in late 2014, but valuations remain low relative to broader indexes, one sign they could be poised to continue their recent outperformance. The 12-month trailing price/earnings ratio of the transports, at 16.1 on Monday, remained below the 20.8 ratio of the Dow industrials, according to data from Birinyi Associates. Market technicians say the transports have been performing well since mid-September, but their postelection surge has helped turn broader market sentiment. <U+201C>As long as they<U+2019>re participating, or in this case outperforming, that tends to enhance what<U+2019>s going on the broader market,<U+201D> said Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG. <U+201C>I think it<U+2019>s bullish. I think the momentum shift is real. Write to Aaron Kuriloff at aaron.kuriloff@wsj.com and Ben Eisen at ben.eisen@wsj.com",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Christy Lee Parker \n source: madworldnews.com \n text: Share This \nAfter the FBI<U+2019>s Friday announcement that they had reopened their investigation into Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s private email server, many have been quick to attack director James Comey for the timing of his recent move. However, Trey Gowdy just obliterated the criticisms while also delivering a nasty surprise directly to Hillary herself. \nThe Democrats have come unhinged as they watch their candidate sink, with the FBI<U+2019>s reopened investigation delivering a devastating blow to an already disastrous campaign. In fact, what<U+2019>s coming out of their mouths as they enter panic mode is almost laughable. Take for instance Howard Dean<U+2019>s claim that Comey is in cahoots with Vladimir Putin or Harry Reid<U+2019>s suggestion that director Comey broke the law. \nIt<U+2019>s rather ironic that he<U+2019>s concerned about Comey following the law while, at the same time, basically suggesting Hillary should get a free pass. In fact, Reid is so concerned about the FBI director<U+2019>s actions in investigating Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s criminality that he had the nerve to write Comey, attempting to intimidate him. <U+201C>I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election,<U+201D> Reid wrote. <U+201C>Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.<U+201D> \nLuckily for us, Trey Gowdy was ready to call Reid out for his crap, and of course, it<U+2019>s all on video for us to enjoy. Watch: \nGowdy wasn<U+2019>t falling for the left<U+2019>s excuses, and he said what we were all thinking. First, he laid into Huma Abedin<U+2019>s excuse that she didn<U+2019>t know how her emails could have ended up on a device she says belongs to her husband. As Gowdy points out, there aren<U+2019>t that many ways it could happen, but it<U+2019>s rather irrelevant since that<U+2019>s not what the FBI is investigating. \nNext, Gowdy took out John Podesta for his <U+201C>blame the cops<U+201D> play, and then came the nasty surprise for Hillary. Gowdy reminded viewers that Comey isn<U+2019>t responsible for a single one of the facts , saying, <U+201C> He didn<U+2019>t tell her to use a private server, he didn<U+2019>t tell Huma not to turn over all of her devices, and God knows, he didn<U+2019>t tell Anthony Weiner to send sexually explicit texts to allegedly underage people. <U+201D> Gowdy continued to put Hillary on blast, saying <U+201C> The timing is a direct and natural consequence of decisions Hillary Clinton made ,<U+201D> reminding everyone of where our focus and blame should be. But, he wasn<U+2019>t done there. \nIt was then Harry Reid<U+2019>s turn to feel the Gowdy heat as the senator ripped into Reid<U+2019>s asinine letter to Comey. <U+201C>Thank God he<U+2019>s leaving is my initial reaction,<U+201D> Gowdy said about Reid before adding, <U+201C>My second reaction is: I did not know Mormons used drugs, and anyone who is capable of sending out that press release has to be under the influence of something.<U+201D> \nThen, Gowdy went right back to putting the attention and blame where it needs to be <U+2014> on Hillary Clinton. <U+201C> The person responsible for this fact pattern is Secretary Clinton ,<U+201D> Gowdy explained. <U+201C>Jim Comey did not tell her to use her private server. He did not say to mislead the public about whether or not you turned over all of your work emails. And he certainly didn<U+2019>t say, Secretary Clinton, why don<U+2019>t you say you neither sent nor received classified information.<U+201D> \nTrey Gowdy successfully obliterated any critics of the FBI and director James Comey while also delivering Hillary the nasty surprise she deserves. Although she<U+2019>s used to skirting consequences, she has no one to blame for what<U+2019>s happening besides herself, and it<U+2019>s nice to see that there are those in Washington, D.C., who are more than willing to wrap up some personal accountability and drop it directly into the presidential candidate<U+2019>s lap. Timing wouldn<U+2019>t be an issue if her own actions didn<U+2019>t lead our entire country down this path. Hillary Clinton has no one but herself to blame for what she<U+2019>s facing. As for timing, now maybe Mrs. Clinton has a little idea what it<U+2019>s like to be aborted just days before delivery.",

Ms. Whitman, who ran unsuccessfully for California governor in 2010, estimates that 90% of her political contributions have been to Republican candidates. She chaired New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie<U+2019>s finance team during his bid for the Republican presidential nomination but criticized his decision to endorse the eventual nominee, Donald Trump. Ms. Whitman endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton in August. In a telephone interview last week, Ms. Whitman said she is backing Democrat Josh Gottheimer in the Nov. 8 election because she believes his opponent, incumbent Scott Garrett, is a <U+201C>Republican extremist.<U+201D> <U+201C>We need reasonable people from all sides to reassert leadership and work together on the country<U+2019>s biggest challenges,<U+201D> Ms. Whitman said. <U+201C>I have no doubt that Josh will play a role in unlocking the gridlock in Washington.<U+201D> Reached by telephone Monday, Mr. Garrett said he has worked for balanced budgets during his time in Washington. <U+201C>Meg Whitman is not really a conservative if she thinks the way that our government is working is fine, that $20 trillion of debt is fine,<U+201D> Mr. Garrett said. Ms. Whitman said she has contributed to Mr. Gottheimer<U+2019>s campaign and urged her largely Republican donor base to support him as well. Her endorsement comes as political analysts show the race tightening in New Jersey<U+2019>s northwestern corner, a historically Republican district that Mr. Garrett has represented since 2003. Two nonpartisan newsletters that early on gave Republicans an advantage in the Fifth Congressional District have changed their ratings. The Cook Political Report now considers the race a <U+201C>toss up<U+201D> and the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report is calling it a <U+201C>toss-up/tilt Republican.<U+201D> Nathan Gonzales, editor of the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, said Mr. Gottheimer<U+2019>s ads attacking Mr. Garrett are resonating with voters. <U+201C>The thrust of the Democratic attacks is that Scott Garrett is out of step with the district, that his views, particularly on social issues, are not representative of North Jersey,<U+201D> Mr. Gonzales said. <U+201C>The polling data shows that people are open to that argument.<U+201D> Mr. Garrett, a founding member of the hardline-conservative alliance known as the House Freedom Caucus, votes conservatively on spending and social issues. Ms. Whitman said his inclination to <U+201C>block everything<U+201D> is counterproductive. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m more of a fiscal conservative, so I believe ultimately in a balanced budget,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>But at some point you have to spend some money to make the government run.<U+201D> Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said he believes Ms. Whitman<U+2019>s endorsement could sway moderate Republican voters who are <U+201C>uneasy with some of the more conservative elements in their own party.<U+201D> Mr. Garrett said Democrats have long coveted his seat, which he has been re-elected to six times. <U+201C>Every election I<U+2019>m in my opponent and the media say that this is going to be a tight race,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We take every race very seriously.<U+201D> Ms. Whitman said she was introduced by a mutual friend to Mr. Gottheimer. She described him as a <U+201C>fiscal conservative and socially progressive individual,<U+201D> a reputation Mr. Gottheimer has sought to establish for himself throughout his campaign. <U+201C>We spoke about the importance of tax reform and lower taxes, investing in infrastructure as a country and treating everybody with respect,<U+201D> Mr. Gottheimer said of his conversation with Ms. Whitman. Sign up here to receive e-mail alerts for breaking news and exclusive stories from The Wall Street Journal<U+2019>s Greater New York section. Mr. Gottheimer, a former Microsoft executive and speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, has never held elective office. He has led Mr. Garrett in fundraising, bringing in $2.9 million as of June 30 to the Republican<U+2019>s $1.4 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. Mr. Garrett still has $2.8 million in cash on hand to his challenger<U+2019>s $2.5 million, largely because his post as chairman of a House Financial Services subcommittee netted him contributions from Wall Street in the past. Many of Mr. Garrett<U+2019>s donors stopped supporting him over the past year, however, after he refused to pay dues to the National Republican Congressional Committee. Media reports at the time said he was boycotting the committee because it was recruiting gay candidates. Mr. Garrett said his comments were <U+201C>distorted<U+201D> and that his opposition is specific to candidates who support gay marriage.",

He had been motivated by politics rather than public service. And he had no damaging information to support his relentless pursuit and the daily negative headlines it generated. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s just a very unfortunate turn of events that we are using the criminal justice system to try to achieve political ends in this country,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton said. The year was 1998, and she was referring to Kenneth W. Starr, the independent prosecutor who spent years investigating Mr. Clinton<U+2019>s administration. But those remarks are echoed in the Clinton camp<U+2019>s response to the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who said on Friday that investigators would review additional emails potentially related to their inquiry into Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s use of a private server. The episodes offer a glimpse into the collective psyche of the Clintons and their allies. After facing 25 years of political attacks and investigations into scandals <U+2014> real and imagined <U+2014> they have developed a protective reflex against potentially damaging assaults, rallying their forces against what they see as an overzealous, partisan villain. The situations are distinct: Mr. Starr was a conservative Republican who, as an independent counsel, had free rein on his investigation; Mr. Comey, a Republican, was appointed by President Obama and answers to the Justice Department. But the way the Clintons and their allies have targeted Mr. Comey speaks to the former first couple<U+2019>s instincts when under attack, impulses that were honed and hardened during the storms of the 1990s. <U+201C>Comey has become the Ken Starr of the 21st century,<U+201D> said Douglas G. Brinkley, a presidential historian and professor at Rice University. <U+201C>When lashed out at, Bill and Hillary Clinton tend to strike back harder and go after character assassination.<U+201D> With no clear timeline on when the F.B.I. will complete its inquiry, the review could haunt the early days of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s administration, should she win the White House. That prospect has sent a shudder through Democrats who remember Mr. Starr<U+2019>s dogged pursuit of Mr. Clinton over Whitewater, a failed real estate project in Arkansas, which ultimately led to revelations that the president had an affair with a White House intern. <U+201C>This will last as long as you<U+2019>re president and beyond,<U+201D> Bernard W. Nussbaum, Mr. Clinton<U+2019>s White House counsel, recalled warning the president about the Whitewater inquiry in an oral history conducted by the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. <U+201C>They will chase your family. They<U+2019>ll chase you.<U+201D> This time, Mrs. Clinton and her allies fought back promptly after news broke about the new trove of emails. They were discovered during an inquiry into Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s top aide, Huma Abedin, over accusations that he made online advances to an underage girl. Mrs. Clinton held a brief news conference during which she criticized Mr. Comey<U+2019>s decision to release a vague letter to Congress 11 days before the election. On Monday, she opened her rally in Kent, Ohio, by saying, <U+201C>There is no case here.<U+201D> The response by Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign was strikingly speedier than the belabored apology she gave after questions about her private server first surfaced. Some Democrats attributed the swift response to the lessons of the Starr investigation. <U+201C>Comey is acting as if he<U+2019>s an independent counsel, as if he had the same authority and absolute power as Starr had,<U+201D> said Joe Conason, a journalist and the author of <U+201C>Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton .<U+201D> Mr. Conason and other Clinton defenders have pointed out that Mr. Starr recently expressed regret for what he called <U+201C>the unpleasantness<U+201D> of his investigation into Mr. Clinton. Mr. Starr had been solicitor general under President George Bush and a judge under President Ronald Reagan before being appointed independent counsel, a position that has since been eliminated and that Mr. Nussbaum called an <U+201C>evil institution.<U+201D> Mr. Comey served as deputy attorney general for President George W. Bush before President Obama nominated him to his current position in 2013. He was confirmed by the Senate 93 to 1 for a 10-year term. Unlike an independent counsel, however, an F.B.I. director can be fired by the president. <U+201C>There are substantial differences that come to mind<U+201D> concerning the two men, said Russell L. Riley, an associate professor at the Miller Center. But, Mr. Riley added, the Clintons<U+2019> <U+201C>reactions are very much the same,<U+201D> forged in battles that began during the 1992 presidential campaign. <U+201C>The idea was always rapid response, don<U+2019>t let a charge go unanswered.<U+201D> Democrats had praised Mr. Comey in July when he recommended that there be no criminal charges against Mrs. Clinton in her handling of emails at the State Department. Donald J. Trump and Republicans blasted the decision. Mr. Comey<U+2019>s letter to Congress on Friday flipped the script. Democrats have assailed his tactics and accused him of responding to political pressure from Republicans to prove he had not gone easy on Mrs. Clinton. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada all but accused Mr. Comey of violating the Hatch Act, which bars government officials from engaging in activity that could influence elections. <U+201C>Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law,<U+201D> Mr. Reid wrote in a letter to Mr. Comey. By Monday afternoon, some Democrats wondered if it was time for Mrs. Clinton and her allies to back off on taking aim at the messenger. To some, it seemed as if Mrs. Clinton were running against Mr. Comey, rather than Mr. Trump, in the final days of the race. Without knowing the substance of the emails, Mrs. Clinton <U+201C>had very little choice but to push back stalwartly,<U+201D> said William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former aide to Mr. Clinton. But, he added, <U+201C>the Clinton campaign should think very hard about what it wants its closing argument to the American people to be.<U+201D> If she prevails on Nov. 8, Mrs. Clinton, who is known for her long memory, is likely to have a fraught relationship with her F.B.I. director. Abner J. Mikva, a former White House counsel to Mr. Clinton, recalled in an oral history that in 1994, in a moment of misplaced optimism, he said that he was sure he and Mr. Starr would get along just fine. <U+201C>From there, every time his name came up, Hillary would say <U+2018>your friend Ken Starr<U+2019> <U+2014> one word, <U+2018>yourfriendKenStarr,<U+2019><U+201D> he said. Years after he left the White House, and after Mr. Clinton<U+2019>s impeachment, Mr. Mikva, who is now deceased, ran into Mrs. Clinton at a fund-raiser. <U+201C>I got up to her, she hugged me and whispered in my ear,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>She said, <U+2018>Now what do you think of your friend Ken Starr?<U+2019> She didn<U+2019>t forget.<U+201D> Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the First Draft newsletter .

And it should be consistent with the nation<U+2019>s guiding principles, as well as internally consistent <U+2013> meaning that the components of the foreign policy don<U+2019>t conflict with each other. \nVia TruthAndAction \n\nIt should be affordable, and recognize the nation<U+2019>s strengths and weaknesses. None of this requires a genius to figure out. In other words, a proper foreign policy is exactly what we do not have in the United States. It<U+2019>s difficult to imagine a more stupid foreign policy than one of using NATO to provoke Russia.\nScroll Down Below For Video NATO should have been disbanded when the Soviet empire fell. Of course, ending a government program, regardless of how useless or detrimental it is, is all but impossible. The Obama Administration<U+2019>s foreign policy in Eastern Europe is one of lunacy as NATO and Russia appear to be preparing for war.\nNobody should admire cowardice. But recklessness needs to be condemned as well. When a nation engages others to assist it in taking rash and provocative actions, it needs to be called out for the danger it is. The military buildup in Eastern Europe, largely sponsored by the Obama Administration, supported by Hillary Clinton, and conducted through NATO, has the potential to trigger the unthinkable.\nA key Russian defence figure says the deployment of US Marines at V<U+00E6>rnes is part of a US buildup to go on a <U+201C>global blitz<U+201D> and warned that Norway may make itself a target for a potential nuclear attack. Frants Klintsevitsj, a deputy chairman of Russia<U+2019>s defence and security committee, told TV2 that Russia views the presence of 330 Marines in Norway as a direct military threat that demands a reaction.

He should be.\nRussia has on several occasions criticized the plans to deploy 330 US troops at V<U+00E6>rnes. Norway<U+2019>s defence minister, Ine Eriksen S<U+00F8>reide, has rejected those criticisms and insisted that the deployment does not constitute a US military base but is rather a test run that will be evaluated during 2017.\n<U+201C>There is no objective reason for the Russians to react to this. But the Russians are reacting at the moment in the same way toward almost everything the Nato countries are doing,<U+201D> S<U+00F8>reide said.\nNow a bit of history to put this into context.\nBefore joining Nato in 1949, Norway allayed Russian fears by pledging not to open its territory to foreign combat troops so long as Norway was not attacked or threatened with attack.\nSomething changed.\nThe perspective of this article may appear to be pro-Russia, but the truth is that the intention is to be neither pro-Russia, nor anti-Russia, but pro-US. It<U+2019>s difficult to see how an Obama Administration sponsored military build-up on Russia<U+2019>s western border is pro-US. Using NATO as a cover doesn<U+2019>t help or give it legitimacy.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Jay Solomon Laura Meckler \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/foreign-policy-debate-scrambled-by-2016-election-1477560601 \n text: The 2016 presidential campaign has thoroughly scrambled traditional positions on foreign policy and international intervention, obliterating many of the usual partisan distinctions and presenting political challenges for whoever wins in November. Hillary Clinton, if elected president, would take a more aggressive posture than President Barack Obama on the international stage, according to her public statements and top aides. That would set her apart from the liberal wing of Democrats led by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has called her too quick to back military force, as well as the anti-interventionist approach advocated by Republican nominee Donald Trump and a growing number in his party. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s approach has given her an unusual set of allies, including from the national-security wing of the GOP, whose members would normally back the Republican nominee but this time rejected Mr. Trump and his approach. If she wins, a senior adviser said, Mrs. Clinton, before her inauguration, would pressure Europe to renew sanctions against Russia, which expire in December. Aides say she also will take a more aggressive posture than the Obama administration in Syria, work to impose a no-fly zone, and will consider new sanctions on Iran, despite Tehran<U+2019>s threat to pull out of a new nuclear agreement if she does. The split between interventionists and noninterventionists in both parties suggests it might be difficult to reach consensus in Washington no matter the election<U+2019>s outcome. <U+201C>I cannot recall a time when you had such an anomalous situation, where elements of both parties are arguing for a risk-averse, sort of withholding approach to the world,<U+201D> said Aaron David Miller of Washington<U+2019>s Wilson Center, a senior diplomat in both Republican and Democratic administrations. The former secretary of state has for years taken a more interventionist approach than members of her party, including when she broke with Mr. Obama by advocating military action to topple Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. She voted in 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq, though later called it a mistake. In an interview, Mrs. Clinton said she believes in combining the tools of American power, including diplomacy and development, to influence events. She pointed to her work gathering international support for financial sanctions against Iran, which she has said helped push Tehran to the negotiating table over its nuclear agreement. <U+201C>I think I<U+2019>ve been very clear that my position is in favor of what I called smart power<U+2026>that uses all the tools at our disposal, and military power always should be a last resort,<U+201D> she said. Mr. Trump has attacked Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s foreign-policy record throughout the campaign, questioning her judgment both in the State Department and Senate. He has said she was too quick to back military operations in Iraq and Libya, and that the Obama administration<U+2019>s nuclear diplomacy with Tehran, which Mrs. Clinton helped initiate, resulted in a flawed agreement. The return of the isolationist right has propelled Mr. Trump<U+2019>s rise, and provides a sharp distinction to Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s history and campaign positions. The Republican<U+00A0>candidate has pledged to renegotiate or back out of trade deals with Asia and Latin America and<U+00A0>said<U+00A0>he would backtrack on U.S. obligations to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization if members don<U+2019>t pay their dues. He has suggested traditional U.S. allies such as South Korea and Japan should develop their own nuclear arsenals and that he could create a working alliance with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In an interview earlier this year, Mr. Trump rejected the idea that the U.S. should be an automatic guarantor of international stability, as it has been since World War II. <U+201C>You have to be properly reimbursed for our tremendous services,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We can<U+2019>t afford it as a country. If they don<U+2019>t pay up we have to be prepared to walk and they<U+2019>ll have to defend themselves.<U+201D> While Mr. Trump<U+2019>s positions have resonated with Republican voters, they have drawn criticism from lawmakers who favor a more interventionist posture. <U+201C>The problem with Trump is he<U+2019>s embraced Reagan rhetoric wrapped around isolation,<U+201D> said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one the most hawkish members of the GOP. Mrs. Clinton, he said, has the right inclinations, though he isn<U+2019>t sure she will act on them, partly due to pressure from other Democrats. <U+201C>I think her instincts will be to be more aggressive,<U+201D> he said. Mrs. Clinton would still not be the first choice of many Republicans, especially those who criticize her for her association with Obama administration policies such as fallout from regime change in Libya and a reset in the U.S. relationship with Russia when she was secretary of state. They also fault her for backing the Iran nuclear deal and Mr. Obama<U+2019>s establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba. From her left, Mrs. Clinton would<U+00A0>have to contend with Democrats who support Mr. Obama<U+2019>s elevation of diplomacy over military power and embrace of traditional U.S. adversaries such as Iran, Cuba and Russia. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a 35-year-old veteran of the Iraq war elected to Congress in 2012 from Hawaii, is among the party<U+2019>s dovish crowd. <U+201C>We need to end these interventionist wars that have cost our countries trillions,<U+201D> Ms. Gabbard said. Some Democrats laud Mr. Obama for the nuclear deal he forged with Iran and his refusal to launch military strikes against the Assad regime in Syria<U+2014>a decision of which Mrs. Clinton was skeptical, according to her political aides and current State Department officials. <U+201C>If you were to ask an average Democrat, <U+2018>Should we be less interventionist abroad?<U+2019> you would get an overwhelmingly positive response,<U+201D> said Rep.

Chicago ANSWER was one of the radical leftist groups that helped to organize anti-Trump protests when his campaign tried to hold a rally in March ; that rally was canceled after protesters clashed with attendees. As The DC reported last week , the group is responsible for organizing rallies in Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Albuquerque. Since holding those rallies, the group has announced <U+201C>mass marches<U+201D> on Inauguration Day in Washington and another one in Chicago on Saturday; the group hopes to <U+201C>shut the streets down<U+201D> at both rallies. In other words, if they can<U+2019>t win an election legally, they<U+2019>ll try to reverse it with violence and <U+201C>birddogging<U+201D> chaos. Before we go any further down this sad road, I want you to keep two things in mind. First, this is what Marxism always does. When it fails one group of people, it oozes away like a red version of The Blob to consume some other poor, unsuspecting populace with its cultural and economic acids. Now that Marxism has left Venezuela devastated and poor, the swarm of Marxist fire ants are trying to do the same here. The Socialist Blob: Coming Soon To A Community Center Near You! Second, like a lot of critics of Trump, these Marxist ants don<U+2019>t listen to his positive message and policy proposals. Instead, like a swarm of worker ants following their queen, the mainstream media, they fixate on the <U+201C>racist<U+201D> or <U+201C>sexist<U+201D> or <U+201C>mean<U+201D> things Trump reportedly said. As I wrote yesterday, Trump hired Steve Bannon for many reasons, but one reason in particular is because they both care about economic justice, middle-class prosperity, and a strong national labor force. So remember: 1) these ants are making trouble for Trump because they smell fresh meat after leaving rotten meat in other places and 2) they are fighting a presidency that will actually help the people they say they care about. Now back to Volpe<U+2019>s report: On Nov. 15, the group held a meeting to plot its next move in its ongoing resistance of the Trump in a space normally operated by the Mexican Solidarity Network, a less well-known group in the mold of La Raza. CHICAGO ANSWER organizers, Stephanie and Mika, co-chaired the evening and Mika said he was also an organizer with the Party for Socialist and Liberation, a radical Marxist group and a frequent partner of ANSWER. Mika fired up the crowd. <U+201C>What do want?<U+201D> he yelled at the crowd. <U+201C>Justice,<U+201D> the crowd roared back. Same as Donald Trump! Law and order! Drain the swamp! <U+201C>When do we want it,<U+201D> he screamed again. <U+201C>Now,<U+201D> the crowd roared even louder. <U+201C>People can and must be organized in a deepening resistance,<U+201D> Stephanie said. <U+201C>As united as possible, as militant as possible.<U+201D> She also said she was willing to <U+201C>work with anyone to resist this administration.<U+201D> Because these ants have no ideas or skills to contribute to society, they prefer to tear anyone who is trying to help in concrete ways<U+2013>hence they hate a celebrated DOER like Donald Trump. Jes<U+00FA>s Rodr<U+00ED>guez-Espinoza is the Counsel General for the Venezuelan consulate in Chicago and while the rest of the speakers accused Trump of the normal litany of grievances <U+2014> that he<U+2019>s a racist, homophobe, misogynist and charlatan <U+2014> Rodriguez said his diplomatic position forbade him from weighing in on Trump. <U+201C>Before I was the Counsel General in Chicago, I was a regular citizen in Venezuela just like you, in 2002, was moved in my basement because of the attack against Hugo Chavez. Because of that I started getting involved in politics. Rodriguez-Espinoza said he became a supporter of Chavez after that. Just goes to show: never trust a Jesus that isn<U+2019>t in the Bible. Rodriquez-Espinoza also claimed the current economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela is over-blown. <U+201C>All the humanitarian crisis that you hear in the media most of that is an exaggeration. The only crisis we face is destabilization in Venezuelan oil. I<U+2019>m not saying everything is perfect; I<U+2019>m just saying it<U+2019>s overmagnified because it<U+2019>s in the interest of the most powerful countries in the world to get rid of the progressive government in Venezuela.<U+201D> According to a June Guardian story , Venezuela has an economic crisis where Gross Domestic Product is contracting by 8 percent, unemployment was at 17 percent, and the inflation rate was at 482 percent. As always, facts are inconvenient things at times. Plus, if oil is Venezuela<U+2019>s main (only??) economic problem, then people like Rodriguez-Espinoza should try to work with Trump as a successful business developer, dealmaker, and, as of this Tuesday, the President-elect over the largest oil discovery in America of all time (20 BILLION barrels in the Permian Basin in southwest Texas). But because he is a short-sighted ant, Roqriguez-Espinoza, and all Marxist ants, to be honest, only know how to swarm and scurry and bite so they can feel <U+201C>progressive.<U+201D> Far be it from them to take the humble, slow route of working, developing, building, and planning like Trump and most of his supporters do on a daily basis.

President Kennedy , Martin King , Robert Kennedy (and here ), and dozens of others were assassinated by the .01% <U+201C>Deep State.<U+201D> The evidence is overwhelming in each case.

If anyone has any refutations of this professional academic factual claim for any of this easy-to-read and documented content , please provide it. US ongoing lie-started and Orwellian-illegal Wars of Aggression require all US military and government to refuse all war orders because there are no lawful orders for obviously unlawful wars. Officers are required to arrest those who issue obviously unlawful orders. And again, those of us working for this area of justice are aware of zero attempts to refute this with, <U+201C>War law states (a, b, c), so the wars are legal because (d, e, f).<U+201D> All we receive is easy-to-reveal bullshit .

Likely treason for lying to US military, ordering unlawful attack and invasions of foreign lands, and causing thousands of US military deaths. Crimes Against Humanity for ongoing intentional policy of poverty that<U+2019>s killed over 400 million human beings just since 1995 (~75% children; more deaths than from all wars in Earth<U+2019>s recorded history). \nUS military, law enforcement, and all with Oaths to support and defend the US Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, face an endgame choice: Demand arrests , with those with lawful authority to enact it. An arrest is the lawful action to stop apparent crimes , with the most serious crimes documented here meaning the most serious need for arrests. Watch the US escalate its rogue state crimes that annually kill millions, harm billions, and loot trillions. \nIn just 90 seconds , former US Marine Ken O<U+2019>Keefe powerfully states how you may choose to voice <U+201C>very obvious solutions<U+201D>: arrest the criminal leaders (video starts at 20:51, then finishes this episode of Cross Talk ): Solutions worth literal tens of trillions to <U+2018>We the People<U+2019>: \nAgain: The top three benefits each of monetary reform and public banking total ~$1,000,000 for the average American household, and would be received nearly instantly.

Congressional Republicans grilled her for hours about it, but have found nothing. These same Republicans just keep on complaining anyway. \nNow, the Director of the FBI, James Comey, wrote a memo saying some newly-found emails may be linked to Hillary Clinton and her private server. \nThe media and the supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump are excited about the possibility of the FBI reopening the investigation. \nSorry, guys, it<U+2019>s not. \nA Republican Congressman started a Twitter shitstorm over this news: FBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \n<U+2014> Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \nSpeaker of the House, Paul Ryan (R-Wis), said that Clinton<U+2019>s security briefings should stop: BREAKING NEWS <U+2192> The FBI is reopening its investigation into Secretary Hillary Clinton. \nMy full statement <U+21E9> pic.twitter.com/LHfyg46dWk \n<U+2014> Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) October 28, 2016 \nAt least Hillary Clinton didn<U+2019>t blab classified information on television. \nMany news outlets falsely reported that the entire investigation was back on. \nThe Associated Press tweeted: BREAKING: US official: Newly discovered emails related to Clinton investigation did not come from her private server. \n<U+2014> AP Politics (@AP_Politics) October 28, 2016 \nThe emails were found during the investigation of disgraced ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner and his latest sexting scandal involving a 15-year-old girl. \nThe FBI doesn<U+2019>t know for sure what is in the emails. It is very difficult to read emails when you don<U+2019>t have a warrant to do so. This puts Comey<U+2019>s letter to Congress in an even shadier light. All they know is that none of the emails are to or from Clinton herself, and they may only be duplicates of emails the FBI already has in their possession. \nThe Department of Justice has received a complaint from the Democratic Coalition Against Trump accusing FBI Director Comey of violating the Hatch Act . \nThe complaint reads in part: <U+201C>This is an election year, and we are just 11 days away from the date that the American public votes to choose the next President of the United States, I am writing to ask that an investigation be opened into Director Comey for any potential violations of the Hatch Act. The timing of this announcement, accompanied by the vague facts of the investigation, seems as if Director Comey was making a political move, and not a professional one.<U+201D> \nPassed in 1939, the Hatch Act limits political activity of federal employees and certain state and D.C. employees who work with federal funding. It is meant to keep federal agencies from taking sides politically, and prevents employees from getting promotions based on political affiliations.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: JACKIE CALMES \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0 \n text: WASHINGTON <U+2014> The stark choice that Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump pose for voters goes as well for their revised tax plans: Mr. Trump would simplify the tax code but cut taxes mainly for the rich and add trillions of dollars to the federal debt, while Mrs. Clinton would do the opposite, an independent analysis released Tuesday concluded. The review by the Tax Policy Center, a joint research arm of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, is the first to examine the plans since Mr. Trump significantly rewrote his proposal after criticisms of its costs and inequities and Mrs. Clinton on Monday proposed to double the existing tax break for parents with young children. <U+201C>They really couldn<U+2019>t be more different,<U+201D> Len Burman, director of the center and a professor at Syracuse University, said in a conference call with reporters. It is unclear that either plan would pass in Congress. If Republicans keep control of the House, even if they lose the Senate, they would probably block Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s proposed tax increases. And while Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plan is similar to one that House Republicans have outlined, many Republicans would probably object to its cost given the size and projected growth of the federal debt as an aging population drives spending higher. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s tax cuts would be the deepest ever, reducing revenue $6.2 trillion in the first decade and mostly benefiting corporations and the highest-income Americans, the center said. Some middle-income families, however, would receive a tax increase. With interest, the cost would be $7.2 trillion over 10 years, nearly doubling the growth in the federal debt that is otherwise projected. The cost would build in subsequent decades, though Mr. Trump denounces the size of the debt at nearly every campaign appearance. His campaign disputed the cost estimates, saying that the Tax Policy Center did not account for the economic benefits of his tax cuts and other policies on trade, energy and federal regulations. The center<U+2019>s economists said they would have another analysis of both candidates<U+2019> plans within days that accounts for economic changes, but said it was unlikely to alter their conclusions much. Mrs. Clinton would substantially raise taxes on high-income taxpayers, mostly on the top 1 percent; slightly reduce taxes on average for middle- and low-income households; and overhaul corporate taxes. Her plan would increase federal revenue $1.4 trillion over the first decade. Rather than lower the federal debt, however, Mrs. Clinton would use the money to pay for education and other initiatives. While Mr. Trump, with exceptions, would simplify the tax code, Mrs. Clinton would make it more complex for taxpayers other than small businesses, the center said. For example, the wealthiest households would face a 4 percent surcharge on adjusted gross income exceeding $5 million, a minimum tax rate of 30 percent, a 28 percent cap on deductions and other tax breaks and a higher capital gains tax on assets held less than six years. President Obama has repeatedly proposed the minimum tax rate, known as the Buffett Rule for the supportive billionaire Warren E. Buffett, and the cap on deductions, both to no avail in Congress. While Mr. Trump, in keeping with his populist message, frequently points to his proposal to end the so-called carried interest tax break for hedge fund operators and other investment managers, the center<U+2019>s analysis reaffirmed that his tax plan actually gave them <U+201C>a much better deal<U+201D> than the existing tax break, Mr. Burman said. Under current law, much of their income is taxed as capital gains, at a preferential rate of 23.8 percent instead of higher income-tax rates. Though Mr. Trump would repeal that break, his plan would allow money managers to pay a new 15 percent business rate and <U+201C>retain a substantial tax advantage on their income compared with wage earners,<U+201D> according to the center. The Trump plan would give the richest 0.1 percent of taxpayers <U+2014> those with incomes of more than $3.7 million this year <U+2014> an average tax cut of $1.1 million, for a 14 percent increase on average in their after-tax income. The middle one-fifth of Americans by income would receive a tax cut increasing after-tax income less than 2 percent, on average, while the poorest fifth would get a break of less than 1 percent. But many large families and single parents <U+2014> a separate study put the number at about eight million families <U+2014> would face tax increases under Mr. Trump<U+2019>s proposals. That reflects his proposals to repeal personal exemptions and the head-of-household filing status. Mr. Trump would reduce the top marginal tax rate for individuals, now 39.6 percent, to 33 percent, and the corporate rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. The Trump campaign has sent contradictory signals about the candidate<U+2019>s plan for owners of so-called pass-through businesses <U+2014> sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations. Campaign officials have told the National Federation of Independent Business that such businesses could pay a flat 15 percent business rate instead of the generally much higher individual rates they currently pay but told accountants calculating the cost of the plan that they would get no such choice. Absent clarification from the campaign, the center assumed that choice would be available and concluded the change could lead to significant tax avoidance <U+2014> of income taxes and payroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare <U+2014> as high-wage employees reclassify themselves as pass-through businesses for tax advantage. Unlike Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump would also repeal taxes on the wealthy that help finance the Affordable Care Act, and eliminate estate and gift taxes. He would tax some capital gains at death and cap some itemized deductions, to hold down his plan<U+2019>s costs. Mr. Trump, in his plan, does not address the tax breaks so beneficial to real estate developers that may have allowed him to avoid federal income taxes for as much as 18 years. Roberton C. Williams, an economist at the tax center, said about one-tenth of 1 percent of high-income taxpayers avoided any federal income taxes. But the number may be larger: Mr. Burman noted that Mr. Trump would not have qualified as rich in the years in question because of the big real estate losses he was claiming.

If fewer than six are false, the party in power gets four more years,<U+201D> he said. \nThese <U+201C>keys<U+201D> include questions about who holds the most seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, the lack of a significant third party campaign, the economy, the extent of a real policy change should a challenger win, the level of social unrest, foreign, and military policies. \n<U+201C>The keys have nothing to do with presidential approval polls or horse-race polls,<U+201D> Professor Lichtman said, going on to make it evident that he personally dislikes Trump a great deal. However, on his system the Democratic party has definitely <U+201C>lost<U+201D> five of the <U+201C>keys,<U+201D> and is well on course to lose a sixth, which, he said, would give the election to Trump by default. \nThe New Observer has long predicted that Trump can only win if at least 70 percent of whites turn out to vote, and that he takes at least two-thirds of the white vote. Anything less than that will see a liberal minority white vote team up with the block nonwhite vote to grant Clinton victory<U+2014>which was exactly how Obama was twice elected. \nTrump<U+2019>s only hope therefore, lies in previous non-voters turning out, a fact to which he alluded in a recent speech, where he mentioned that reports coming in from the early voting figures revealed a massive surge in people who had never voted before.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: REALdeal \n source: realfarmacy.com \n text: by Jonathan Benson \nThe primary way in which your body expels toxins is via the liver, which detoxifies and cleanses your body by continuously filtering the blood of poisons that enter it through the digestive tract, the skin, and the respiratory system. But when your liver becomes overworked as a result of stress or excessive exposure to toxins, your entire system can be thrown off balance, and your health severely compromised. \nSince the liver is also responsible for producing bile, another form of detoxification that is metabolically necessary for the breakdown and assimilation of fats and proteins from your food, it is exceedingly important that your liver be properly maintained. Without a well-functioning liver, your body will be unable to cleanse itself and absorb nutrients, which is a recipe for a health disaster. \n<U+201C>The thousands of enzyme systems that are responsible for virtually every body activity are constructed in the liver,<U+201D> writes Dr. Karl Maret, M.D., about the importance of vibrant liver function. <U+201C>The proper functioning of the eyes, the heart, the brain, the gonads, the joints, and the kidneys, are all dependent on good liver activity.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>If the liver is impaired from constructing even one of the thousands of enzyme systems the body requires, there is an impairment in overall body function and a resultant greater metabolic stress on the individual.<U+201D> \nSo here are seven important foods you may want to begin incorporating into your diet in order to maintain a healthy liver. \n\nGarlic, grapefruit, green tea, and green vegetables Garlic contains numerous sulfur-containing compounds that activate the liver enzymes responsible for flushing out toxins from the body. This bulbous relative of the onion also contains allicin and selenium, two powerful nutrients proven to help protect the liver from toxic damage, and aid it in the detoxification process. \nGrapefruit is rich in natural vitamin C and antioxidants, two powerful liver cleansers. Like garlic, grapefruit contains compounds that boost the production of liver detoxification enzymes. It also contains a flavonoid compound known as naringenin that causes the liver to burn fat rather than store it ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk ). \nGreen tea is loaded with catechins, a type of plant antioxidant that has been shown in studies to eliminate liver fat accumulation and promote proper liver function ( http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v26/n11/abs/0802141a.html ). This powerful herbal beverage also protects the liver against toxins that would otherwise accumulate and cause serious damage. \nLeafy green vegetables such as bitter gourd, arugula, dandelion greens, spinach, mustard greens, and chicory also contain numerous cleansing compounds that neutralize heavy metals, which can bear heavily on the liver. Leafy greens also eliminate pesticides and herbicides from the body, and spur the creation and flow of cleansing bile. \n\nAvocados, walnuts, and turmeric Rich in glutathione-producing compounds, avocados actively promote liver health by protecting it against toxic overload, and boosting its cleansing power ( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/12/001219074822.htm ). Some research has shown that eating one or two avocados a week for as little as 30 days can repair a damaged liver. \nWalnuts, which contain high levels of l-arginine, an amino acid, glutathione, and omega-3 fatty acids, also help detoxify the liver of disease-causing ammonia. Walnuts also help oxygenate the blood, and extracts from their hulls are often used in liver-cleansing formulas. \nTurmeric, one of the most powerful foods for maintaining a healthy liver, has been shown to actively protect the liver against toxic damage, and even regenerate damaged liver cells. Turmeric also boosts the natural production of bile, shrinks engorged hepatic ducts, and improves overall function of the gallbladder, another body-purifying organ. \nTo learn more, visit: http://www.globalhealingcenter.com",

They also have right to demand a new one or vote in person at a polling station in case their previous ballot was not counted. Before that Trump claimed several times about imperfect election system of the US, which allows vote rigging.

        "input": "time: null \n author: DavidSwanson \n source: washingtonsblog.com \n text: Posted on October 26, 2016 by DavidSwanson \nOfficially, of course, the national bird of the United States is that half-a-peace-sign that Philadelphia sports fans like to hold up at opposing teams. But unofficially, the film National Bird has it right: the national bird is a killer drone. \nFinally, finally, finally, somebody allowed me to see this movie. And finally somebody made this movie. There have been several drone movies worth seeing , most of them fictional drama , and one very much worth avoiding ( Eye in the Sky ). But National Bird is raw truth, not entirely unlike what you might fantasize media news reports would be in a magical world in which media outlets gave a damn about human life. \nThe first half of National Bird is the stories of three participants in the U.S. military<U+2019>s drone murder program, as told by them. And then, just as you<U+2019>re starting to think you<U+2019>ll have to write that old familiar review that praises how well the stories of the victims among the aggressors were told but asks in exasperation whether any of the victims of the actual missiles have any stories, National Bird expands to include just what is so often missing, and even to combine the two narratives in a powerful way. \nHeather Linebaugh wanted to protect people, benefit the world, travel, see the world, and use super cool technology. Apparently our society did not explain to her in time what it means to join the military. Now she suffers guilt, anxiety, moral injury, PTSD, sleep disorder, despair, and a sense of responsibility to speak out on behalf of friends, other veterans, who have killed themselves or become too alcoholic to speak for themselves. Linebaugh helped murder people with missiles from drones, and watched them die, and identified body parts or watched loved ones gather up body parts. \nEven while still in the Air Force, Linebaugh was on a suicide watch list and had a psychologist recommend moving her to a different sort of job, but the Air Force refused. She has episodes. She sees things. She hears things. But she<U+2019>s forbidden to discuss her work with friends or even with a therapist who doesn<U+2019>t have the proper <U+201C>security clearance.<U+201D> \nWe let Daniel down even more than Heather. He says he actually opposed militarism but was homeless and desperate, so he joined the military. We could have given him a house for much less than we paid him to help murder people at Fort Meade. \nLisa Ling worked on a database filled by drone surveillance that compiled information on 121,000 <U+201C>targets<U+201D> in two years. Multiply that by a dozen years. With 90% of victims not among the targets, add up how many people would die in the targeting of the whole list. That<U+2019>d be over 7 million. But it<U+2019>s not numbers that have poisoned the souls of these three veterans; it<U+2019>s children and mothers and brothers and uncles lying in pieces on the ground. \nLing travels to Afghanistan to see the place at ground level and to meet with drone victims. She meets a little boy who lost his leg and his 4-year-old brother and his sister and his father. On February 2, 2010, drone <U+201C>pilots<U+201D> at Creech Air Base murdered 23 innocent members of one family. \nThe filmmakers have voices read the written transcript of what the drone operators said to each other before, during, and after sending in the missiles that did the damage. This is worse than Collateral Murder . The people whose job it is to identify children and others who should not be murdered have identified children among the group of people being targeted. The <U+201C>pilots<U+201D> at Creech are eager to reject this information and to get onto killing as many people as they can. Their lust for blood drives the decision process. Only after they<U+2019>ve killed 23 people do they recognize children among the survivors, and the lack of guns. \nWe see the bodies brought home to bury. Those injured describe their suffering, physical as well as mental. We see people being fitted with artificial legs. We hear Afghans describe their perception of drones. They imagine, just as many Americans may imagine, and just as viewers of Eye in the Sky would imagine, that drone operators have a clear, high resolution view of everything. In fact, they have a view of fuzzy little blobs on a computer screen that looks like it was created in the 1980s. \nLinebaugh says there is no way to distinguish the little <U+201C>civilian<U+201D> blobs from little <U+201C>militant<U+201D> blobs. When Daniel hears President Obama claim that there is always near certainty that no civilians will be killed, Daniel explains that such knowledge is simply not possible. Linebaugh says she was often on the side of the conversation telling the <U+201C>pilots<U+201D> at Creech not to murder innocents, but that they always pushed for permission to kill. \nJesselyn Radack, attorney for whistleblowers, says in the film that the FBI told two whistleblowers that a terrorist group had put them on a kill list. She said that the FBI has also contacted Linebaugh<U+2019>s family and warned her that <U+201C>terrorists<U+201D> have been searching for her name online, suggesting that she fix this problem by shutting up. (She had written an op-ed in the Guardian ). \nThe FBI also raids Daniel<U+2019>s house, arriving with 30 to 50 agents, badges, guns, cameras, and search warrants. They take away his papers, electronics, and phone. They tell him he is under investigation for a possible indictment under the Espionage Act. This is the World War I-era law for targeting foreign enemies that President Obama has made a routine of using to target domestic whistleblowers. While Obama has prosecuted more people under this law than did all previous presidents combined, we probably have no way of knowing how many people have been explicitly threatened with the possibility. \nWhile we should be apologizing to, comforting, and aiding these young people rather than denying them the right to speak to anybody and threatening them with decades in prison, Lisa Ling did manage to find some kindness. Victims of drone strikes in Afghanistan told her that they forgave her. As the film ends, she<U+2019>s planning another trip to Afghanistan. This entry was posted in General .

A technician works to prepare voting machines to be used in the upcoming presidential election, in Philadelphia, Friday, Oct. 14, 2016. \nCould these connections be enough to implicate the Clinton Foundation in the alleged early vote rigging in Texas? \nAs usual, the internet has come through as the ultimate watchdog while the supposed safeguards of our democracy have failed. \nA Gab user by the name <U+201C>Special Prosecutor Will Logan<U+201D> has found some stunning information. Note: as Gab is a members only site, you<U+2019>ll have to join to see his actual posts, but we included all pertinent information in the article. Click to enlarge \nAccording to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. \nThe McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation <U+2013> apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 <U+2013> when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? \nEither way, it doesn<U+2019>t look good. \nBut there<U+2019>s more. \nAs the same user notes in this post , Dominion Voting Systems and The Clinton Foundation did a 2.25 million dollar charity initiative in developing nations together called the DELIAN Project. \nAccording to the project<U+2019>s own website : In 2014, Dominion Voting committed to providing emerging and post-conflict democracies with access to voting technology through its philanthropic support to the DELIAN Project, as many emerging democracies suffer from post-electoral violence due to the delay in the publishing of election results. Over the next three years, Dominion Voting will support election technology pilots with donated Automated Voting Machines (AVM), providing an improved electoral process, and therefore safer elections. As a large number of election staff are women, there will be an emphasis on training women, who will be the first to benefit from the skills transfer training and use of AVMs. It is estimated that 100 women will directly benefit from election technology skills training per pilot election. \nOf course, this is all speculation, and we are not making any claims of illegal activity by the Clinton Foundation. \nHowever, it presents a very troubling conflict of interest. Most Americans would certainly agree that voting machines should have zero connection to presidential candidates and their foundations. \nConsider the implications further abroad, as well. Could this DELIAN Project be designed to influence elections in developing nations? \nIt can certainly be argued that electronic voting machines do not in fact provide an <U+201C>improved electoral process<U+201D> or provide <U+201C>safer elections<U+201D> \nAgain, this is speculation.

Mr. Trump<U+2019>s comments during the election campaign about seeking a better relationship with Russia rattled Eastern European officials. Those worries were accentuated with a Kremlin report of a<U+00A0>phone call Monday between Messrs. Trump and Putin that said the two leaders agreed on a collaborative dialogue based on <U+201C>principles of equality, mutual respect and noninterference.<U+201D> Diplomats have said Kremlin requests for<U+00A0>noninterference amount to a demand of a recognition of a Russian sphere of influence in the countries of the former Soviet Union, most important Ukraine. Germany, which has had a growing role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in recent years, has long pushed to balance the alliance<U+2019>s steps to deter Russia with more dialogue. On Tuesday,<U+00A0>German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said Mr. Trump<U+2019>s desire for dialogue was <U+201C>completely understandable,<U+201D> but she issued a pointed reminder that <U+201C>it<U+2019>s also important not to forget our principles,<U+201D> noting Russia<U+2019>s annexation of Crimea and what she called its hybrid war in Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Mr. Trump<U+2019>s call to Mr. Putin was <U+201C>a very normal thing.<U+201D> Mr. Stoltenberg said NATO for months has been emphasizing that it wants dialogue. But he too noted that the alliance wouldn 't accept the annexation of Ukraine<U+2019>s Crimean peninsula. <U+201C>There is no contradiction between strong defense and political dialogue,<U+201D> Mr. Stoltenberg said. <U+201C>We think it is important to respect territorial integrity and sovereignty of all nations, including Ukraine.<U+201D> During the campaign, Mr. Trump raised the possibility that U.S. defense of European allies could be contingent on whether they spend enough on defense, comments that have rattled diplomats here since the election . President Barack Obama, at a news conference before his last foreign trip as president, said Mr. Trump had told him he was interested in <U+201C>maintaining our core strategic relationships.<U+201D> Mr. Obama said he would tell foreign leaders <U+201C>there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America<U+2019>s commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO.<U+201D> Mr. Stoltenberg<U+00A0>on Tuesday<U+00A0>said he shared Mr. Trump<U+2019>s view that Europe must spend more on defense and said he expected the new president to continue the U.S. role in NATO <U+201C>I am certain he will be a president of the United States who will live up to all the commitments of the United States in the alliance,<U+201D> Mr. Stoltenberg said. <U+2014>Valentina Pop contributed to the article.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Author \n source: journal-neo.org \n text: Country: Syria Turkey, in a bid to legitimize its uninvited, illegal incursion into northern Syria, has created several media platforms specifically reporting on what it calls <U+201C>Operation Euphrates Shield.<U+201D> Operation Euphrates Shield, according to official Turkish government statements, aims at <U+201C>securing<U+201D> a buffer zone in northern Syria spanning from the Euphrates river in the east and extending all the way to Azaz in the west. This is also coincidentally the exact same buffer zone US policy think tanks have called for since at least 2012 <U+2013> specifically seeking Turkey to implement it. The Brookings Institution <U+2013> a corporate-funded policy think-tank whose policymakers have helped craft upper-level strategy for the Iraqi, Afghan, Libyan, and now Syrian conflicts as well as plans laid for future confrontations with Iran and beyond <U+2013> has been explicit regarding the true nature of these <U+201C>buffer zones.<U+201D> In a 2015 paper titled, <U+201C> Deconstructing Syria: A new strategy for America<U+2019>s most hopeless war ,<U+201D> it states: <U+2026>the idea would be to help moderate elements establish reliable safe zones within Syria once they were able. American, as well as Saudi and Turkish and British and Jordanian and other Arab forces would act in support, not only from the air but eventually on the ground via special forces. The paper goes on by explaining (emphasis added) : The end-game for these zones would not have to be determined in advance. The interim goal might be a confederal Syria, with several highly autonomous zones and a modest (eventual) national government. The confederation would likely require support from an international peacekeeping force, if this arrangement could ever be formalized by accord. But in the short term, the ambitions would be lower<U+2014>to make these zones defensible and governable, to help provide relief for populations within them, and to train and equip more recruits so that the zones could be stabilized and then gradually expanded. Despite claims that Turkey<U+2019>s actions are necessary to <U+201C>stop<U+201D> the self-proclaimed <U+201C>Islamic State<U+201D> (ISIS) and help end the deadly conflict raging in Syria, it is clear that instead, Turkey is carving out territory specifically to shelter militants fighting the Syrian government in an attempt to perpetuate, even expand the violence for as long and as extensively as possible. Joint operations between Washington and Ankara in Manbji, a well-known waypoint for Islamic State fighters, weapons and equipment coming from Turkey bound for Raqqa, would effectively open <U+201C>a second front<U+201D> in the ongoing fight to drive the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, from Syria<U+2019>s borders, [Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu] said. It was Turkey<U+2019>s own foreign minister who was quoted by the Washington Times in an article written just before Turkey embarked on its invasion titled, <U+201C> Turkey offers joint ops with U.S. forces in Syria, wants Kurds cut out ,<U+201D> admitting that ISIS was being supplied and reinforced specifically from within Turkish territory. The article stated (emphasis added): It is thus abundantly clear that ISIS sprung into being and has since sustained itself through extensive state sponsorship <U+2013> sponsorship that has flowed freely over Syria<U+2019>s borders with Turkey and Jordan. Any genuine attempt to cripple the source of ISIS<U+2019> fighting capacity would require securing the Turkish and Jordanian borders with Syria, not invading Syria itself. As ISIS Disappears, Militants Magically Multiply Operation Euphrates Shield can be followed on popular social media platforms, including Twitter. Turkish officials regularly post self-incriminating updates regarding their activities within Syrian territory. On October 21, the operation<U+2019>s official Twitter account claimed : \nTurkish Army-backed FSA has tripled number of its soldiers thanks to its achievements against terrorist organizations. However, this claim is highly problematic. The process of crossing a battlefield successfully alone does not <U+201C>increase<U+201D> the number of soldiers fighting in one<U+2019>s army unless militants an army is engaged against are recruited into the advancing force. <U+201C>Liberated<U+201D> civilians would not be able to simply <U+201C>join<U+201D> Turkish-backed militant groups. A responsible military commander knows that incorporating untrained civilians into a military force without at least 1-3 months of basic training creates more disadvantages and dangers than any benefits gained from <U+201C>tripling<U+201D> the size of one<U+2019>s force. Additionally, men of fighting age found on the battlefield in areas Turkish-backed troops are advancing through must be vetted to ensure they have no ties to terrorist organizations including ISIS <U+2013> yet Turkey<U+2019>s government has not given any details on how these <U+201C>new fighters<U+201D> are being either vetted or trained. In other words, it simply seems as if Turkey is attempting to explain why <U+2013> within the buffer zone it is creating <U+2013> numbers of militants are swelling without admitting that the entire purpose of the buffer zone in the first place is and always was to provide a sanctuary for Al Qaeda, ISIS, and other extremist forces inside Syria just as Turkey has provided them sanctuary in Turkey for the last 5 years. Turkey<U+2019>s Operation Euphrates Shield is indeed a shield wielded by Turkey and its US partners. But it is a shield lifted up not in defense of the Syrian people or the Turkish state itself, but instead brought to face those forces decisively defeating Al Qaeda and ISIS deeper within Syria and poised to push remaining militants out of Syria, permanently. With the establishment of a Turkish occupied buffer zone <U+2013> as imagined by US policy makers who crafted this operation for Turkey long ago <U+2013> it will now be exceedingly difficult to eradicate remaining militants at the edge of Syrian territory after they are defeated and driven out of the nation<U+2019>s interior. Indeed Turkey is shielding a region west of the Euphrates, not from terrorists, but to protect them.

There was one omission: Donald Trump, now the president-elect. With Mr. Trump set to take office in January, justice-reform groups across the political spectrum are scrambling to find a path forward. Following a wave of changes across the states, a federal overhaul this year became a hot topic in Washington and a rare spot of bipartisan convergence. Both chambers of the Republican-controlled Congress pushed criminal-justice bills, arguing that reforms would both reduce crime and save money. President Barack Obama cited the effort in his State of the Union address . The push fell short, and now advocates of changes such as shorter prison sentences find themselves searching for hints on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s positions. Many of these activists see Mr. Trump<U+2019>s selection of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.) for attorney general as a bad sign. Mr. Sessions has been one of Congress<U+2019>s staunchest opponents of a criminal-justice overhaul, arguing it would put Americans in danger. Earlier this year, he said a proposed sentencing bill <U+201C>would release thousands of violent felons and endanger millions of Americans whose safety is increasingly threatened by rising crime rates,<U+201D> which reform proponents dispute. Some activists also cite the president-elect<U+2019>s tough-on-crime rhetoric and praise of New York<U+2019>s stop-and-frisk police tactics as signs he won<U+2019>t support change. But Mr. Trump rarely spoke explicitly about criminal-justice policies on the campaign trail, and some activists are hoping he will see the issue as a way to connect with the rising number of Americans whose friends and family members have served time behind bars. Justice Department data shows that the number of people incarcerated in the U.S. more than quadrupled from 1980 to 2.2 million as of 2014. Representatives of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s transition team didn<U+2019>t respond to requests for comment on his plans. Had Democrat Hillary Clinton been elected president, a criminal-justice overhaul would have been <U+201C>a top three issue,<U+201D> said Kevin Ring, vice president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums. Under the leadership of Mr. Trump, <U+201C>We<U+2019>ll be fighting for scraps,<U+201D> he said. Some groups, like the American Civil Liberties Union, are responding by refocusing on the states. Udi Ofer, the ACLU<U+2019>s deputy national political director, said he was encouraged by state ballot results, citing Oklahoma<U+2019>s decision to approve criminal-justice-overhaul measures. <U+201C>The same voters who voted for Donald Trump by a wide margin also voted for aggressive sentencing reform that will reduce that state<U+2019>s prison population,<U+201D> Mr. Ofer said. <U+201C>To me that is the most concrete signal coming out of the 2016 elections on criminal-justice reform.<U+201D> Others aren<U+2019>t giving up on a federal push. <U+201C>People say a President Trump would be disastrous for criminal justice reform, but I think that<U+2019>s completely ridiculous,<U+201D> said Holly Harris, executive director of the U.S. Justice Action Network. Ms. Harris acknowledged that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s selection of Mr. Sessions to head the Justice Department could set the movement back, but she said having him out of the Senate would at least mean he no longer could directly impede an overhaul bill. Ms. Harris added that others close to Mr. Trump, such as Vice President-elect Mike Pence and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, support changes to criminal-justice laws. A representative for Mr. Sessions declined to comment. Timothy Head, executive director of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, was optimistic about the prospect for certain changes to the criminal-justice system under Mr. Trump. The conservative Christian group, which counts a criminal-justice overhaul among its priorities, has had more access to Mr. Trump than liberal activists championing the cause, and Mr. Head said the president-elect may want to use criminal-justice issues to reach out to minority communities, following the example of some Republican governors. He said he also expects Mr. Trump to be less interested in relatively contentious changes like reducing prison sentences and more attracted to causes that conservatives back, such as helping former prisoners re-enter society and combatting <U+201C>overcriminalization.<U+201D> While many overhaul proponents on the left and right agree there are too many federal crimes on the books, some Republican lawmakers also want to require criminal intent for more prosecutions. Democrats resist that because they say it could let corporate criminals off the hook. For Inimai Chettiar, justice program director at the Brennan Center, tweaking the system won<U+2019>t be enough. After running the ACLU<U+2019>s state-level campaign to end mass incarceration, she concluded that the only way to enact far-reaching changes was to make criminal justice a national issue. It was Ms. Chettiar who conceptualized the book of essays by political leaders on the left and right, minus Mr. Trump, and she created a group of law-enforcement leaders favoring changes in an attempt to elevate the issue beyond state legislatures. But following Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election, Ms. Chettiar said she needs to again go back to the drawing board. <U+201C>The opportunity for very large progressive criminal-justice reform in Washington is not going to happen,<U+201D> she said.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Steven Broiles \n source: fellowshipoftheminds.com \n text: Posted on November 4, 2016 by DCG | 1 Comment \nSeattle proggies love to push businesses out of their city. \nFrom MyNorthwest.com : Seattle City Councilmember Tim Burgess proposed a 241 percent business license fee hike for pot shops, citing inspection and enforcement costs associated with regulating the two-year-old retail marijuana industry. \nThe proposed increase, introduced at Wednesday<U+2019>s budget meeting, would raise the annual licensing cost within Seattle to $3,450 from the existing $1,000 . Cannabis retailers <U+2014> and one council member <U+2014> immediately questioned the proposal, saying that the math doesn<U+2019>t make much sense. \n<U+201C>So what justified the increase other than the fact that we can do it?<U+201D> asked District 2 Councilmember Bruce Harrell, citing Mayor Ed Murray<U+2019>s more modest proposal for a $500 increase. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve done a cost analysis that actually reflects (the increase)? It seems like we<U+2019>ve exceeded it quite significantly.<U+201D> \nThe city<U+2019>s Finance and Administrative Services department defended the cost, saying that even with the mayor<U+2019>s proposed increase, the licensing fee falls $430,000 short of the city<U+2019>s cost to regulate pot. The finance department projected that pot retailers will cost the city more than $700,000 next year. \nPot growers and retailers wondered why this industry, from a license fee standpoint, must pay for its regulation in a way that other businesses, such as pawn shops and strip clubs, do not. Moreover, the city finance estimate misses a key point, said KC Franks, owner of Stash pot shops. <U+201C>What about the $2 million in new sales taxes to the city?<U+201D> Franks asked. <U+201C>Why doesn<U+2019>t their math reflect that?<U+201D> Seattle Council Tax-Raising-Advocate Tim Burgess \nBurgess, who said he has no independent confirmation of the sales tax figures, conceded that the pot retailers have, <U+201C>raised some legitimate objections, so I<U+2019>m sure we are going to look at all of that.<U+201D> \nBut, he added, the pot issue speaks to a larger policy discussion about how cities pay for the cost of regulating local businesses. Typically, he said, a city uses a blend of licensing fees and taxes to get the money for necessary inspections and enforcement. Pot, he said, costs Seattle about $1 million a year to regulate, an amount which he characterized as a big burden. <U+201C>This proposal was made to try to offset some of those costs,<U+201D> he said \nBurgess said the licensing fee likely will go up, but he is not sure if the full council will support his proposed increase. The measure, as it is or modified, could come to a vote next week. \nFranks and other marijuana retailers characterized the proposal as a simple cash grab directed at an industry without much political clout <U+2013> or as much money as people seem to think. Philip Dawdy, of the Have a Heart pot shop, wondered why an industry that is a net contributor to city coffers doesn<U+2019>t have more council support? \nWhen the city raised business license fees to help pay for more police, he said, they consulted retail business organizations first. The pot fee, he said, was a complete blindside. <U+201C>We are actually helping to balance the city<U+2019>s budget thanks to sales taxes,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Why are we not someone<U+2019>s priority?<U+201D> \nDCG",

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/tight-senate-contests-set-new-spending-records-1478548518 \n text: The most competitive contests for the U.S. Senate this year are spending more money than ever, with the Pennsylvania race between GOP incumbent Sen. Pat Toomey and his challenger, Democrat Katie McGinty, leading the pack as the most expensive in history. That race, one of the closest of the year, has already surpassed $162 million in spending. Mr. Toomey, a first-term senator, is one of nine Republicans running in states that President Barack Obama won either in 2008 or 2012. But his race, nonpartisan analysts say, was considered one of just a handful of the purest tossup on the map<U+2014>hence the heavy spending there. Already this year, two races have surpassed the record set in 2014 in the North Carolina contest between then-Sen. Kay Hagan and Thom Tillis, who unseated her. In that race, candidate and outside spending topped $114 million<U+2014>$10 million more than the next most expensive Senate race that year. In 2012, the most expensive race of the cycle was in Massachusetts, at a price tag of nearly $90 million. This year, the influx of spending in Senate races reflected the degree to which some top Republican outside groups, including outfits run by GOP strategist Karl Rove and the Koch brothers, opted not to spend on the candidacy of the party<U+2019>s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, and instead direct their considerable resources to Senate contests. Senate money also moved around the map in 2016, reflecting the changing calculations by parties and outside groups as individual races changed<U+2014>some that looked highly competitive early in the cycle, like Ohio and Florida, ended up being less so, while some such as Indiana and Missouri are closer than expected. Pennsylvania was one of the most consistently competitive. Of that state<U+2019>s Senate race total, which encompasses both the primary and general election campaign, $115 million came from outside groups, including party committees and super PACs, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. <U+201C>When you see a truly competitive environment, you see the spending just balloon,<U+201D> said Josh Stewart, a spokesman for the Sunlight Foundation, which tracks money in politics. <U+201C>Outside groups beget more outside groups, and almost every outside player is in Pennsylvania.<U+201D> A unique set of circumstances put the cost of Pennsylvania<U+2019>s Senate seat above the rest. It opened with a competitive Democratic primary contest, between Ms. McGinty and former Rep. Joe Sestak. Several outside groups<U+2014>including the Senate Democrats<U+2019> campaign arm and Emily<U+2019>s List, an organization that promotes female candidates<U+2014>intervened on Ms. McGinty<U+2019>s behalf, driving up the race<U+2019>s price tag early. The state is also home to some of the nation<U+2019>s most expensive media markets in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. In addition to television and digital advertisements, some super PACs, including the league of Conservation Voters Action Fund, invested to set up ground operations, an expensive proposition in the sprawling state. Republican spending was bolstered mainly by the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), which invested over $15 million there. The network of groups backed by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch also made re-electing Mr. Toomey a priority, pouring in $10 million between its super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, and a nonprofit group, Americans for Prosperity, which isn<U+2019>t required to disclose its donors. But as in other states, a smaller band of conservative spenders were outflanked by a broad coalition of liberal outside groups, including labor, environmental and women<U+2019>s organizations, whose combined firepower overcame Republicans<U+2019> big-dollar donor advantage. In all, liberal outside groups spent $62 million backing Ms. McGinty, while conservative groups spent $52 million for Mr. Toomey. Two other Senate contests also topped $100 million in spending: New Hampshire, at $120 million, and Nevada, at $110 million. Both are also considered tossups. GOP groups paid particular attention to Nevada, where Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid <U+2019>s retirement opened the best opportunity to pick up a Democratic seat. Outside groups spent over four times as much as the candidates to influence the outcome of the contest. Chief among them were the Koch brothers, who used the race as an opportunity to target Mr. Reid, a perennial foe. They invested $9 million in total, including a robust ground effort. Florida and Ohio, the next two most expensive races, both saw infusions of outside spending early on, when analysts believed they would shake out to be the most competitive of the map. That early cash influx, coupled with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio <U+2019>s late decision to seek a second term in June, allowed Republicans to consolidate leads in both places<U+2014>considerably slowing the money pouring in to defend the incumbents or bolster their challengers. By contrast, Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana were all home to contests that grew unexpectedly competitive late in the election season, setting off a frenzied last-minute push to air ads in those races. All three surpassed $60 million in spending, with North Carolina reaching $76 million. Of the 10 most expensive races this year, only Wisconsin and Illinois, both at the bottom of the list, saw more spending by the candidates than by outside groups. In both races, Democrats were heavily favored to win, though the Wisconsin race has tightened in the closing weeks. In Illinois, the candidates spent $28 million, compared with only $4 million contributed by outside groups. Overall, candidates and outside groups spent a total of $1.8 billion on Senate and House contests, according to data provided by the Campaign Finance Institute. That actually represents a slight decline from the last campaign held concurrently with a presidential contest in 2012, when candidates and outside groups spent more than $1.9 billion. The decline is in line with a larger reduction in election spending this cycle. Among House races, the most expensive contest unfolded in the district encompassing Palm Beach, Fla.<U+2014>the seat that Rep. Patrick Murphy vacated to run for the Senate. Much of the $23 million spent on that contest alone came from the candidates themselves; the Democrat running, Randy Perkins, is a millionaire businessman who self-funded his candidacy. A Las Vegas-area seat being vacated by GOP Rep. Joe Heck has been the target of the next most cash<U+2014>with over $21 million spent there to try to flip the seat into the Democrats<U+2019> column. Another seat, in Minnesota<U+2019>s working-class iron range, also involved over $20 million in spending<U+2014>with both the primary Democratic and Republican super PACs working to elect House members making it their top target. Rep. Rick Nolan, whose district is favorable territory for Republican nominee Donald Trump, is perhaps the most vulnerable incumbent Democrat in the country, and the GOP has spent millions to defeat him.

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-four-legs-of-a-new-health-care-system-1480550930 \n text: Donald Trump announced this week that he had chosen Rep. Tom Price (R., Ga.), a leader in the efforts to replace ObamaCare, to be his secretary of Health and Human Services. This is a consequential choice. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election, and the political realignment it represents, offers a generational opportunity to pursue a new direction for American health care. Mr. Price will now be leading the charge. The new system should be fully consumer driven, empowering individuals to be the surveyors and purchasers of their care. Past reforms in this direction became stilted and ultimately incomplete, but the current moment offers a chance to truly rebuild from the ground up. If Messrs. Trump and Price want to make the most of this short window, they should keep four central reforms in mind. 1. Provide a path to catastrophic health insurance for all Americans . There<U+2019>s ample evidence that enrollment in insurance doesn<U+2019>t always lead to improvements in health<U+2014>but access to health insurance is important nonetheless. A 2012 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found higher insurance enrollment from reforms in Massachusetts led to better results in several measures of physical and mental health. Health insurance is also important for financial security. The ObamaCare replacement should make it possible for all people to get health insurance that provides coverage for basic prevention, like vaccines, and expensive medical care that exceeds, perhaps, $5,000 for individuals. Those Americans who don<U+2019>t get health insurance through employers, or Medicare and Medicaid, should be eligible for a refundable tax credit that can be used to enroll in a health-insurance plan. The credit would be set at a level comparable to the tax benefits available to individuals with employer-sponsored insurance plans. The subsidy would be enough to make a basic level of catastrophic coverage easily affordable for all Americans. 2. Accommodate people with pre-existing health conditions. The price of insurance naturally reflects added risk. That<U+2019>s why beach houses cost more to insure than a typical suburban home. Yet there is a reasonable social consensus that people should not be penalized financially for health problems that are largely outside of their control. So as long as someone remains insured, he should be allowed to move from employer coverage to the individual market without facing exclusions or higher premiums based on his health status. If someone chooses voluntarily not to get coverage, state regulation could allow for an assessment of the risk when the person returns to the market. This would prevent healthy people from waiting until they get sick to buy insurance, which is one reason ObamaCare<U+2019>s insurance markets are unstable. The refundable tax credit ensures that everyone, including the unemployed, can get access to at least catastrophic insurance and maintain continuous coverage. Well-run and properly funded high-risk pools can help address the inevitable cases of expensive claims for the remaining uninsured. 3. Allow broad access to health-savings accounts . ObamaCare pushed millions of Americans into high-deductible insurance without giving them the opportunity to save and pay for care before insurance kicks in. There should be a one-time federal tax credit to encourage all Americans to open an HSA and begin using it to pay for routine medical bills. And HSAs combined with high-deductible insurance should be incorporated directly into the Medicare and Medicaid programs. An NBER study from 2015 concluded that families spent between 7% and 22% less on health care in the three years after switching to an HSA. Spending was also lower for outpatient services and pharmaceuticals, without any increase in emergency-room spending. As millions of consumers begin using HSAs, the medical-care market will begin to transform and deliver services that are convenient and affordable for patients. 4. Deregulate the market for medical services. HSAs will empower the demand side of the market, but suppliers need freedom from regulation to provide packages of services better tailored to people<U+2019>s needs. For example, those consumers who maintain HSA balances should be allowed to use their resources to purchase direct care<U+2014>basic services that keep people healthy and treat illnesses and chronic conditions<U+2014>from physician groups. This might take the form of a monthly fee, a practice sometimes referred to as direct primary care. Today, this could be considered an insurance premium that<U+2019>s barred by law. Hospitals and physicians should also be allowed to sell access to their networks of clinics, oncology services, and inpatient facilities as an option to be used in the event a patient is diagnosed with an expensive illness. Medicare patients should be allowed to purchase the option to consult with their caregivers by phone, videoconferencing, or email. These are only some of the needed reforms. Regulation shouldn<U+2019>t be an obstacle to entrepreneurs crafting more consumer-oriented services, many of which can<U+2019>t be countenanced under current rules. American health care is teetering because it relies too much on governmental coercion. A functioning marketplace can deliver high-quality care at lower cost. Now is the time to secure a system that empowers consumers to take command of their health care. Mr. Capretta and Dr. Gottlieb are resident fellows at the American Enterprise Institute.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Dom the Conservative \n source: madworldnews.com \n text: Share This A Muslim family in the United Arab Emirates arranged a marriage for their son, only to find that he <U+201C>got out<U+201D> of the deal in the most gruesome way. \nThe family of a Muslim man was celebrating the upcoming wedding of their young patron when they suddenly heard blood-curdling screams coming from his room. When his brother rushed to see where what all the shrieking was about, he stumbled upon a gruesome scene with the groom holding something horrific in his hand. \nMost ancient religions and cultures have a history of arranging marriages and often forcing unwilling participants into betrothals with people they<U+2019>ve never met and have no desire to wed. However, unlike many other ideologies, Islam rampantly continues to cling to not only arranged marriage but also polygamy, child marriage, and incest. Unlike other religions that have reformed and progressed, there is no hope for Islam, as its most revered prophet commanded and modeled these same barbaric behaviors. \nIn a bizarre series of events, a young Muslim man in the United Arab Emirates found himself in an arranged marriage that he found completely insufferable. The 26-year-old refused to take a second wife, a refusal that is uncommon with men in Muslim-majority countries unless the bride is found to be undesirable for reasons including defilement, unsatisfactory appearance, poor financial status, or un-Islamic behavior. Instead, the young man, who has a wife and 2 daughters in another country, found a way to dissolve the betrothal in the most shocking way. \nFeeling that there was no other way to get out of the engagement, the Khaleej Times reports that the unnamed man decided to render himself <U+201C>unfit<U+201D> to be married by taking a knife and slicing off his genitals. He surmised that if he is unable to perform his marital duties by consummating their wedding night, his fiance<U+2019>s family would be convinced to pull their daughter out of the arranged marriage. \nThe Muslim groom<U+2019>s family was adamant that he marry a second wife, somehow forcing the 26-year-old man into a marriage of their own choosing. It was after a family argument that the groom<U+2019>s brother heard blood-curdling screams and burst into the room to find the man covered in blood and his genitals mutilated. \nThe brother immediately rushed the young man to the Al-Kuwaiti Hospital, collecting the severed penis in a plastic bag. Thanks to the brother<U+2019>s quick thinking, doctors at the nearby Al-Qassimi Hospital accepted the victim as a transferred patient and informed him that they would be able to reattach the organ. \n<U+201C>I have conducted a number of surgeries on male organs; but this case was very strange and rare as the organ was separated from the body and was brought to us in [a] plastic bag,<U+201D> Dr. Younis Al-Shamsi added. \nIncredibly, the Muslim man refused the surgery, arguing that he would still be forced to marry the woman after his recovery. After much coaxing, his brother finally convinced him to have his penis surgically reattached. The process took just 3 hours, and the man is expected to make a full recovery. \nThe Quran states that men are allowed to take up to 4 wives as long as they provide for them. The latter part of the scripture even encourages Muslim men to marry one of their sex slaves <U+201C>who their right hand possesses<U+201D> if they have trouble finding a suitable Muslim woman. Of course, Allah considers women nothing more than property, as the Quran states twice that men should beat their wives if they fear even the slightest disobedience from them. In fact, Allah specifically told Job, a character stolen from Judaism and Christianity, that he must take a tree branch and beat his wife after she mocked him in her grief over the loss of their children. \nLikewise, the Islamic prophet Muhammad proved that this was what Allah intended by beating his own child bride , Aisha, after she caught the pedophile sneaking out of their house in the middle of the night. His reasoning was that his property had left the house without his permission. \nLuckily for the fiance, this man didn<U+2019>t see her as his next victim with whom he could unload his perverse sexual fantasies and physically torture her if she had any objection. Still, the Islamic oppression of women and children continues to see millions enslaved to abusive predators that are given divine authority to treat them as they wish.",

Trump has largely taken the high road since winning the presidency last week in a historic election that few predicted. Beginning with his victory speech in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, Trump has repeatedly promised to unify a badly divided country after a campaign marked by an unprecedented amount of ugly rhetoric. He has mostly stayed away from the type of personal attacks he so happily lobbed at adversaries and critics throughout his upstart bid. Story Continued Below But flashes of the old Trump have continued to surface, as they did on Sunday, even as he works to come off as presidential. In between celebratory posts to Twitter announcing the fence-mending phone calls he<U+2019>s received from former GOP foes, Trump took time to complain about The New York Times<U+2019> coverage of him and needle the newspaper for missing the movement that catapulted him into the White House. <U+201C>Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the <U+2018>Trump phenomena,<U+2019><U+201D> Trump wrote on Sunday morning, adding in a subsequent post that <U+201C>the @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change <U+2014> doubt it?<U+201D> From there, Trump took a much more pacifying tact on Twitter, announcing that he had received congratulatory phone calls from Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush and former Presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush. He characterized the four phone calls, all from prominent Republicans who did not support his White House bid, as <U+201C>very nice!<U+201D> By Louis Nelson Trump also announced a congratulatory phone call from John Kasich, the Ohio governor who stubbornly refused to endorse Trump and did not attend the Republican National Convention even though it was held in his home state. But the president-elect quickly dipped back into attack mode on Twitter, writing that <U+201C>the @nytimes states today that DJT believes more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.<U+2019> How dishonest are they. I never said this!<U+201D> Trump has previously said that nations like Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia should all have nuclear weapons. The president-elect also shed some light on his approach to what was a foundational issue for his White House run: immigration. During an interview scheduled to air Sunday night on CBS' <U+201C>60 Minutes,<U+201D> Trump stayed away from the hard-line stance he took during the GOP primary, that he would deport every undocumented immigrant currently in the United States. He told CBS reporter Lesley Stahl that he will first seek to deport only those undocumented immigrants with a criminal history, a group Trump estimated to number 2 million or 3 million. <U+201C>What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that they're talking about who are terrific people.\" Trump<U+2019>s team of high-profile surrogates also made the rounds Sunday, walking the same tightrope as the president-elect, balancing bombast with Trump's clear desire to win over at least some of those on the other side of the political aisle who did not support him in the election. Agriculture By Helena Bottemiller Evich Appearing on CBS<U+2019> <U+201C>Face the Nation,<U+201D> longtime supporter Newt Gingrich said Trump must <U+201C>swing for the fences<U+201D> in his first 12 months in office, warning him to have a <U+201C>very, very aggressive first year<U+201D> because <U+201C>the swamp doesn't want to be drained. And the swamp will just suck you in if you let it.<U+201D> But Gingrich also said Trump must seek bipartisan support for his package of proposals once he takes office, recommending that he partner with incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on a massive infrastructure project. Seeking such cooperation would ensure that Trump<U+2019>s legacy will be protected against the kind of undoing that many of President Barack Obama<U+2019>s initiatives are likely to face once Trump takes control of the White House, the former House speaker said. <U+201C>I think it's very important that Trump try to have as many Democrats as possible help him do this,<U+201D> Gingrich said. <U+201C>Because one of the lessons of the Obama years is: If you do things that are big on a purely partisan basis, they're not stable. I mean, I think Trump wants to change America to make it great again for a generation. Not just for eight years.<U+201D> Talking about the Washington swamp that Trump so famously promised to drain, the president-elect<U+2019>s former campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told <U+201C>Fox News Sunday<U+201D> that his supporters should pay no attention to the fact that the presidential transition team has been stocked with exactly the type of political insiders he railed against in his stump speeches. Familiar faces like Gingrich, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) all serve as vice chairmen of the Trump transition team<U+2019>s executive committee, and a collection of lobbyists have already begun advising the real estate mogul. But Trump<U+2019>s supporters have no reason to worry, Conway said, proclaiming: <U+201C>The gravy train is about to have its wheels blown off and its engine completely ripped from its bearings.<U+201D> <U+201C>Look, these are people who are talented and have done this before. You can't just appoint novices; you have to have people who know what they're doing, but at the same time moving forward this is an administration that's going to run very differently than typical Washington,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>Finally, the voters got what they wanted, what they've been begging for for 30 years, which is give us the opportunity, give us a person who actually represents the outsider, non-Washington, business-experienced type of profile, somebody who goes to Washington owing nobody anything.<U+201D> 2016 By POLITICO MAGAZINE Giuliani, who last week called protesters demonstrating against Trump<U+2019>s election on college campuses across the country <U+201C>crybabies,<U+201D> said Sunday on ABC<U+2019>s <U+201C>This Week<U+201D> that the president-elect<U+2019>s team is sympathetic to their concerns. He said Trump has a clear mandate by virtue of his commanding Electoral College win, regardless of the fact that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, because <U+201C>the Constitution of the United States doesn<U+2019>t change the powers of the president based on the number by which you get elected.<U+201D> The former New York mayor, widely rumored to be under consideration to become either attorney general or secretary of homeland security, said protesters have banged on his car window as he arrived at Trump Tower in the days since the election. He called on those demonstrating <U+201C>to please respect the democratic process<U+201D> and praised President Barack Obama and Clinton for their graciousness in defeat. Still, he said they should do more to speak out against those protests that have turned violent, for which Giuliani said there should be zero tolerance. <U+201C>I think we understand [protesters'] frustration. We certainly don<U+2019>t want to make it worse. I think they<U+2019>re exaggerating the fears of a Donald Trump presidency because they<U+2019>re coming off a campaign where they<U+2019>re very disappointed,<U+201D> Giuliani said. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m sure our supporters would have been very disappointed had Donald Trump not won. And I just hope it calms down.<U+201D> By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

Part of that learning curve teaches children to never lie. These children grow up into successful, trustworthy adults, right? How To Make An Organic Super Food For Survial At Home - Watch Video Click Here \nLawyers, doctors, government officials, and so on are all supposed to be upstanding citizens. They are supposed to represent truth and freedom for our nation. \nWhere there is great responsibility, there is also opportunity to abuse this power. Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s appointed chairman, John Podesta, is familiar with this all too well. \nTruth seeker and founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has released Hillary Clintons deleted emails from her private server to make Americans aware of what<U+2019>s going on. \nIn a world where it<U+2019>s difficult to tell what<U+2019>s right and what<U+2019>s wrong anymore, its natural to feel fear. However, <U+201C>fear<U+201D> is what people like Hillary Clinton thrive on. \nThe FBI is revisiting the initial Clinton email scandal and has provided newly declassified information about the Clinton Foundation via the FBI Vault . \nIn an email sent to Cheryl Mills from John Podesta the evening of March 2, 2015, hours after the New York Times reported that Clinton possibly violated federal record requirements by using the private server, a shocking revelation has been uncovered. \nAccording to the latest batch of Podesta<U+2019>s hacked emails, Podesta writes, <U+201C>Not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later.<U+201D> \nMills responded, <U+201C>Think you just got your new nick name.<U+201D> \nThe <U+201C>Lanny<U+201D> reference is to lawyer Lanny Davis, who served as special counsel to former President, Bill Clinton. Lawyers, unfortunately, are not always the most honest individuals and have been known to cover up for their guilty clients. Hillary Clinton is one of these lawyers. \nCheryl Mills is the same woman who oversaw the controversial construction of a South Korean sweat shop being built in Haiti. A week after this email exchange took place, Hillary Clinton announced that she would love nothing more than to share her emails with the general public, claiming she had nothing to hide. At least, she didn<U+2019>t think she did. \nAfter being subpoenaed by federal court, Hillary Clinton acid-washed her private server, deleting thousands of emails. She denied, under oath, that classified information was ever on the server or sent/discussed via her private email address. Do you think Hillary Clinton ever gets tired of lying, each lie covering up the next? \nAcid-washing a server costs a pretty penny. If she truly had nothing to hide, why did she completely bleach her server free of everything? \nThanks to leaked emails from WikiLeaks, it has been proven that Hillary lied when she said no classified information had ever been involved with her private server- Not only was there classified information stored and talked about, but hackers were able to intercept the data and correspondence. \nNew York Post comments, <U+201C>Democrats on the House Oversight Committee point to Clinton tweeting on March 4, 2015, calling on the State Department to release her 55,000 pages of work files.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>I want the public to see my email,<U+201D> Hillary wrote two days after the Podesta message. \nAt the time, the real Lanny Davis was in support of Clinton addressing her emails. \nAnother WikiLeaks email displays members of the Clinton Organization getting frustrated with Davis<U+2019> public voicing. \n<U+201C>We gotta zap Lanny out of our universe,<U+201D> campaign manager Robby Mook wrote Podesta March 8, 2015. <U+201C>Can<U+2019>t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.<U+201D> \nGood thing for Lanny Davis, <U+201C>zap<U+201D> doesn<U+2019>t equate to <U+201C>wet-work.<U+201D> \nAlthough Davis may have been rash to announce and support Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s innocence, the DNC had major issues with it. \nDavis told Fox News host Chris Wallace, during a televised interview, about Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s private email server- <U+201C>there can be a neutral party to review all these records <U+2013> nothing unlawful.<U+201D> \nApparently, Davis wasn<U+2019>t given the memo by Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s team regarding her bleached server and it<U+2019>s true contents. \n<U+201C>I think it is a reasonable idea if anybody has any doubts that there<U+2019>s a delete on a hard drive- to have an independent go inspect her private e-mail?<U+201D> Davis added. \nHillary Clinton is known for lying, her own chairman doesn<U+2019>t even believe her when she claims she <U+201C>forgets<U+201D> things. Even Podesta Knows She Is A Liar \nHillary Clinton wouldn<U+2019>t know honesty if it slapped her in the face. She is a psychopathic liar that thirsts for ways to obscenely scam on a global spectrum. \nShe calls out Donald Trump for <U+201C>using the system<U+201D> but in no way has he abused the system in the grand scale that the Clintons have. He<U+2019>s a business man, he was simply following the laws that government had implemented. \nFloods of emails and documents are being leaked every day by Anonymous, WikiLeaks and the FBI. These are desperate cries for help mostly from whistle blowers who have been intimately involved with the government, trying to warn American citizens of certain madness and despair that awaits us if Hillary Clinton wins presidency. \nDonald J. Trump genuinely cares for the American people. He is a natural leader, he enjoys helping people because he believes in bettering America, not policies that encourage <U+2018>pay for play<U+2019>. \nHillary Clintons transparency is starting to become blurred. Shatter the busted deception and lock everyone involved with the Clinton scandals in prison. \nDonald Trump recognizes the need for America to rebuild, which starts with depleting government corruption and replacing government officials. This is something Hillary could never accomplish. Hillary Clinton would just hire her friends and abuse her position of power, as she<U+2019>s done for nearly four decades. \nJohn Podesta suggested that Hillary Clinton delete her emails- he must believe she is capable of worse than sharing classified information and as president of the United States, who would stop her from committing even more crime? She would put each and every one of our lives on the line and not think twice. \nJohn Podesta doesn<U+2019>t even believe in her, why should America?",

Instead, they voted more or less as they always have: along party lines. The share of women who voted for Donald J. Trump and who didn<U+2019>t vote for Hillary Clinton was, if you look at past data, not all that surprising. For years, political science has shown that party outweighs gender when it comes to voting. This election, despite all the gender ferment, turned out to be little different. If anything, a small percentage of men who would ordinarily vote Democratic seem to have voted Republican, according to exit polls , which are generally good at capturing gender breakdown of the electorate. The gender gap <U+2014> the difference in the share of men and women who vote for a candidate <U+2014> was 11 percentage points for Mr. Trump (53-42), similar to the gender gap for Bill Clinton in 1996 and Barack Obama in 2012, and in line with the gender breakdown of Republican voters. Fifty-four percent of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s voters were women, and 42 percent of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s, an overall change of only one percentage point in Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s favor compared with 2012. Forty-one percent of her voters and 53 percent of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s were men, an overall change of five percentage points in his favor. Typically, at least 90 percent of voters in each party vote for that party<U+2019>s candidate, according to Kathleen Dolan , professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who studies women in politics. Of Republican women, that appears to have happened for Mr. Trump. Fifty-three percent of white women voted for him, just as the majority of white women have voted Republican in recent elections. The only potential aberration is that only 87 percent of Democratic white men voted for Mrs. Clinton, slightly less than would be expected, Ms. Dolan said. There could be various reasons for that, and she said we did not yet know how significant it was. The results show how deep party affiliation runs, even in the most atypical of elections, when gender played a bigger role than usual in the campaigns. <U+201C>We know this, yet we have this expectation from living in the world that sex really matters,<U+201D> Ms. Dolan said. <U+201C>It does not change things at all. What matters 99.9 percent of the time is their political party.<U+201D> In her research , she asked voters during congressional and governors<U+2019> elections in 2010 and 2014 about male and female candidates in general, and found that they held gender stereotypes about their strengths and weaknesses, like women excelling at health policy and men at crime policy. Two months later, she interviewed the same voters, this time using the names of the male and female candidates running. Gender stereotypes evaporated, and people chose candidates based on party, not gender. Other research has come to similar conclusions . There is very little evidence that women vote for women because of their sex, Ms. Dolan said. The reason it can seem that female voters are voting for female candidates is that both are more likely to be Democrats, so they<U+2019>re actually voting along party lines. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s sexist remarks didn<U+2019>t turn large numbers of Republican women away from him. Seventy percent of voters in exit polls said they thought his behavior toward women was a problem, but 30 percent of the people who said that voted for him anyway. <U+201C>People can have attitudes about these sort of gendered things, and they still very rarely rise to the level of importance in their calculations,<U+201D> Ms. Dolan said. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s no better test than this election.<U+201D> The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/opinion/the-big-companies-that-avoid-taxes.html?_r=0 \n text: Donald Trump has become the country<U+2019>s most notorious tax shirker. And while his long avoidance of federal income taxes is extreme, it<U+2019>s also part of a larger problem. The most affluent and powerful parts of our society have too easy a time legally avoiding taxes. Consider corporate taxes, which ultimately tend to be paid by the well-off, because they own the most stock. The official corporate rate is 35 percent, infamously higher than in any other advanced economy. Yet there are so many loopholes that companies often pay relatively little in tax. Many companies work hard to shroud how much they really pay, sprinkling various figures throughout their complex financial statements. But companies must report one number that provides a good glimpse. It<U+2019>s called cash taxes paid <U+2014> the combined amount that a company pays in federal, state, local and even foreign taxes. I asked the analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence to calculate this number since 2007 for this country<U+2019>s 500 largest public companies, and the results reveal a broken tax system. Fixing it should be an early priority for the next president. If Hillary Clinton wins, it may well be. A good case study is Amazon, which pays a rate much lower than its more traditional retail competitors. Between 2007 and last year, the company paid only 13 percent of its profits in taxes. Remember: That<U+2019>s not just federal taxes. It<U+2019>s federal, state, local and foreign taxes. How does Amazon get away with this? A tangle of tax breaks and loopholes, some enacted in the name of creating jobs despite meager evidence that they do. For many companies, the key move is opening offices in a low-tax country like Ireland and then claiming that much of their business flows through those offices. Put all these tax breaks together, and you end up with our system. AT&T and General Electric each paid a combined tax rate of only 18 percent since 2007, according to the S&P data. Coca-Cola, Apple and IBM paid 17 percent, and Alphabet (Google<U+2019>s parent) is at 16 percent. Boeing is at 8 percent, Facebook at 4 percent. And the following tax rate will sound familiar to anyone who has been watching the presidential campaign: PG&E, the California-based utility company, has paid zero net taxes since 2007. In fact, it has paid negative taxes, receiving tax breaks more valuable than its tax payments. <U+201C>The tax code, on the business side and the personal side, is a rotting economic carcass,<U+201D> Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, told me. <U+201C>All these games are significantly eroding the American tax base.<U+201D> The inequities contribute to the great American stagnation that I described in last week<U+2019>s column . The billions of dollars in taxes being avoided by G.E., Coca-Cola and others is money that can<U+2019>t be used to lift living standards for ordinary families: It can<U+2019>t be used to reduce their taxes and can<U+2019>t pay for schools, medical research or clean energy. There is another victim, too <U+2014> one easily forgotten in this populist time. Many large companies do indeed pay a lot of taxes. For one reason or another, these companies can<U+2019>t take advantage of loopholes and must pay a rate much closer to the official one. Brick-and-mortar retailers, for example, aren<U+2019>t as politically popular as manufacturers or technology companies and haven<U+2019>t persuaded Congress to create a lot of special tax breaks. Retailers also can<U+2019>t easily pretend their business is based overseas. As a result, CVS, Home Depot, Walmart and Target have all been paying a combined tax rate of more than 30 percent, more than twice as high as Amazon<U+2019>s rate. This system is cumbersome <U+2014> causing companies to devote great effort to tax avoidance <U+2014> and unfair. A better system could lift economic growth, by directing more of investors<U+2019> money to truly promising companies, rather than tax-advantaged ones. Fortunately, there are signs of hope. Overhauling the corporate tax code is a rare issue on which the two parties have some common ground . If the Democrats take the Senate, Wyden is in line to lead the Finance Committee and says its first priority will be a big bill to improve roads, bridges and public transit systems (and create jobs). The second will be a corporate-tax bill to pay for the infrastructure. Both are good ideas. As strong as the case for change is, corporate-tax reform will still cause a nasty political fight. Companies make millions of dollars from tax avoidance. To defend the status quo, some will devise clever arguments to suggest that a new system would somehow destroy jobs or otherwise wreak havoc. They will pretend they<U+2019>re just looking out for the rest of us. Don<U+2019>t be fooled. You can find me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook .

Trump and giving the Republican Party its first victory in a presidential race here since 1988. In Macomb County, just north of Detroit, where the term <U+201C>Reagan Democrats<U+201D> was coined after white autoworkers abandoned the party for Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, Mr. Trump captured 53.6 percent of the vote, compared with 47.6 percent statewide, according to preliminary results. Many of his supporters here were blue-collar Obama voters who saw modern-day Republicans as out of touch with their interests until Mr. Trump, with his brash outsider message, came along. Chris Vitale, a longtime Chrysler employee and United Auto Workers member, supported Barack Obama twice, as did his union and his county. But on Tuesday, Mr. Vitale rejected the U.A.W.<U+2019>s choice, Hillary Clinton, and voted with gusto for Mr. Trump. <U+201C>The Republicans that generally get run are anti-manufacturing, anti-Midwest,<U+201D> said Mr. Vitale, 44, of St. Clair Shores, explaining why he rejected Mitt Romney in 2012 and Senator John McCain in 2008. <U+201C>Mr. Trump understood our problems right off the bat, without being told by anyone.<U+201D> Macomb County<U+2019>s autoworkers were hardly alone in gravitating toward Mr. Trump. Patricia Meadows, a retired waitress, voted for Mr. Obama in 2012 because she liked him, she said, and was hopeful about his health care law . But this time around, Ms. Meadows had no use for Mrs. Clinton or any candidate who had spent time in the nation<U+2019>s capital. Mr. Trump was the lesser of two evils because he was <U+201C>not so political,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>I think everybody in Washington needs a kick in the rear,<U+201D> Ms. Meadows, 68, said on Thursday as she ate fried fish at a diner in Warren, a weathered city at the county<U+2019>s southern end. <U+201C>And I think Washington needs to be done with the Clintons.<U+201D> She added, however, that she hoped Mr. Trump would not <U+201C>do away with the health care<U+201D> <U+2014> Mr. Obama<U+2019>s Affordable Care Act <U+2014> as he had promised on the campaign trail. Her daughter had obtained subsidized insurance coverage through the law for $50 a month. <U+201C>I think he was bluffing,<U+201D> Ms. Meadows said with a frown. Mayor James R. Fouts of Warren said Trump supporters here were especially motivated by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s promise to overturn or overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement, which they blame for the loss of American manufacturing jobs to Mexico. All year, Mr. Trump has attacked Ford Motor Company in particular for planning to move all of its small car production to Mexico. Noting that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont also criticized free trade agreements when he ran against Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primary race, Mr. Fouts said that some who normally vote Democrat in Macomb County had initially supported Mr. Sanders and migrated to Mr. Trump only after Mrs. Clinton became the Democratic nominee. <U+201C>There were a significant number of Sanders people who made the transition to Trump,<U+201D> said Mr. Fouts, whose office is nonpartisan. <U+201C>Bernie might have won here; Joe Biden might have won. But Hillary was never going to be the candidate to convince people around here that she was going to make a difference in their lives.<U+201D> Mr. Fouts voted for Mr. Obama twice. But this time he rejected both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump for a third-party candidate <U+2014> which one, he would not say. The last time the county backed a Republican presidential candidate was in 2004. Mr. Trump may also have energized a segment of Macomb County voters who had not bothered to participate in the 2012 election. Voter turnout in the county was 4 percent higher this year, according to preliminary results, with 67 percent of registered voters casting ballots. On the other hand, some of the state<U+2019>s most heavily Democratic counties, including Wayne, home to Detroit, and Genesee, home to Flint, saw less turnout than four years ago. Amanda Rogers, a bartender in Warren, sat out the 2012 election but hustled to the polls to vote for Mr. Trump. Her boyfriend and her brother voted for the first time in their lives, she said. Ms. Rogers, 34, was motivated in part by what she saw as Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s lenient stance on immigration. <U+201C>We are drowning right now,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>Our vets are homeless. There<U+2019>s one out of every five American children starving right now. And Clinton wants to open the floodgates and let everybody else in.<U+201D> Ms. Rogers, who said she had <U+201C>loved Bill Clinton as a president<U+201D> and found Mr. Obama <U+201C>all right,<U+201D> added: <U+201C>There<U+2019>s people who<U+2019>ve been here 12 years who don<U+2019>t even care to learn the language but want to reap all the benefits of this country: food stamps, free health care, Section 8 housing, welfare checks. People are sick of that, especially in Macomb County.<U+201D> Muslims from places like Yemen and Bangladesh are the most visible immigrants here. Just south of Macomb County is Hamtramck, which in one generation went from overwhelmingly Polish Catholic to majority Muslim. In Macomb, the City of Sterling Heights, home to a large Ford plant, is facing a federal lawsuit after rejecting a proposed mosque last year. Mr. Trump held a rally last Sunday in Sterling Heights, where he elicited boos against Mrs. Clinton when he said she wanted <U+201C>virtually unlimited immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world,<U+201D> and would <U+201C>import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and your communities.<U+201D> Macomb County, though still largely white, is becoming more diverse: 82.3 percent of its 865,000 residents were white in 2015, according to the Census Bureau, down from 85.4 percent in 2010. The black population grew to 11.4 percent, from 8.6 percent. About 10 percent of the population is foreign born. Many here also complain that poverty and crime are growing. As Macomb helped assure Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory on Election Day, it also played a major role in the defeat of a local ballot initiative that would have taxed its residents, and those of four neighboring counties, to build a public transportation system connecting Detroit and its suburbs. Jason Powrozek, 18, a high school senior from New Baltimore, on the more affluent north side of the county, said he had voted against the transportation measure because <U+201C>I just felt it would speed up the transport of drugs up here from the inner city.<U+201D> A first-time voter, he had volunteered for at the county Republican headquarters and went to New York for the Trump campaign<U+2019>s election night party. <U+201C>He tells it like it is,<U+201D> Jason said of Mr. Trump. <U+201C>He speaks what people don<U+2019>t want to say because it<U+2019>s politically incorrect.<U+201D> Mr. Trump also spoke on Halloween at Macomb Community College. Frank Pitcher, 49, who lives in Sterling Heights and has worked at its Ford plant for 23 years, went to the Trump rally there and said he was surprised at how many of his co-workers he saw. <U+201C>I took some pictures with people there and posted on my Facebook because I wasn<U+2019>t going to hide how I was voting,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m not ashamed of where I stand.<U+201D> Brittany Greeson contributed reporting.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Ariana \n source: realfarmacy.com \n text: by ARIANA MARISOL \nIf you have ever been to a grocery store, you have probably mistaken sweet potatoes for yams. Surprisingly, many people have actually never had a real yam before. You can blame incorrect labeling for this mix-up. \nThe confusion stems from the names of yams and potatoes being used interchangeably in the U.S. market and in recipes even though sweet potatoes and yams are two distinctly different vegetables. \n\nThe Yam that is Not a Yam It is important to recognize that sweet potatoes are not yams and yams are not sweet potatoes. Although the two are tuberous root vegetables that come from a flowering plant, they are not related and do not have a lot in common. \n\nA Sweet Potato Sweet potatoes comes from the morning glory family and have many varieties. They are normally elongated with tapered ends and their skin ranges from white and yellow, to purple and brown. The flesh of sweet potatoes ranges from white, yellow, orange, and even orange-red. \nOne (200 grams) baked sweet potato is 180 calories and contains 214% vitamin A, 52% vitamin C, 50% manganese, 36% copper, 34% vitamin B6, 29% biotin, 27% potassium, and 26% fiber. \nThe two major types of sweet potatoes grown in the U.S. are: \nSoft sweet potatoes: copper skin and orange flesh \nFirm sweet potatoes: golden skin and pale flesh \nThese two types of sweet potatoes are cooked differently. Firm sweet potatoes remain hard and slightly waxy after being cooked, while its softer variety becomes creamy and soft when cooked. \n\nA Real Yam Native to Africa and Asia, yams are related to lilies, and range in size from as small as potatoes to as big as 5 feet long. Yams are cylindrical shaped with blackish or brown, bark-like skin and white, purple, or reddish flesh. \nYams have a dry, starchy consistency and are hard to find in the United States because they are mostly imported from Africa. Many local grocery stores do not carry true yams and your best chance of finding them would be at specialty markets. \nA 1-cup serving of yam provides 20% of your daily needs of potassium and copper. Potassium helps produce healthy muscles and energy. Copper helps with the synthesis of collagen, hemoglobin, and melanin. \n\nWhat is Labeled as a Yam in Grocery Stores? If real yams are hard to find, why do many grocery stores say that they sell <U+201C>yams<U+201D>? Normally, these <U+201C>yams<U+201D> are actually sweet potatoes. By knowing this, you will be able to shop smarter and actually find what you are looking for. \nAs mentioned above, there are two different types of sweet potatoes found in normal U.S. grocery stores <U+2014> <U+201C>soft<U+201D> sweet potatoes, and <U+201C>firm<U+201D> sweet potatoes. The firm variety of the two was introduced to the United States first. When the softer version began to show itself in markets, there was a need to differentiate the two. These softer sweet potatoes slightly resemble yams so they were labeled as such. \n\nYam <U+2014> Soft sweet potato with copper skin and orange flesh. \nSweet potato <U+2014> Firm sweet potato with golden skin and light flesh. \nIf you want to cook a classic baked sweet potato with crispy skin and fluffy orange flesh, what you should buy will most likely be labeled as a yam. Remember what kind of sweet potato you want when going to the store and be aware of the yam/sweet potato labeling concept. Remember to keep an eye out for different coloration to better identify what you want. \n\nAriana Marisol is a contributing staff writer for REALfarmacy.com.

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/fords-tango-with-trump-1479682041 \n text: Ford Motor Co. announced late last week that it won<U+2019>t shift production of its Lincoln MKC to Mexico from Louisville, Kentucky, as planned. This is good news if Ford believes that Donald Trump will make the U.S. more competitive but a bad precedent if it is bending to the President-elect<U+2019>s political wishes. The U.S. auto maker had intended to move production of its MKC, a luxury crossover SUV, to Mexico to increase output of the higher-volume Escape at its Louisville plant, which is operating at full capacity. While this cross-border migration would not have jeopardized American jobs (which are protected by the United Auto Workers labor agreement), keeping the MKC in Kentucky could lead to more domestic investment. In a statement, Ford said that <U+201C>we are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness.<U+201D> CFO Bob Shanks noted on a conference call that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s promises to cut taxes and increase public-works spending could <U+201C>provide an environment where it makes economic sense to build back up manufacturing jobs here.<U+201D> This seems to have displeased many progressives who have spent the last eight years denying that the Obama Administration<U+2019>s tax and regulatory policies have depressed investment. Ford<U+2019>s decision is also a counterpoint to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s claim that the U.S. needs to renegotiate trade deals and impose protective tariffs to bring back manufacturing jobs. Make the U.S. more competitive and more businesses will come<U+2014>or stay. According to the Tax Foundation, the U.S. marginal effective tax rate on capital investment (35.3%) is the highest in the industrial world and twice as high as in Mexico (17.4%) and Canada (18.6%). The effective rate for U.S. manufacturers is much higher than for, say, real estate. Mr. Trump has proposed cutting the corporate tax rate to 15% from 35% and allowing U.S. companies to repatriate income already earned abroad at a 10% rate. His plan would also allow manufacturers to fully expense their capital investment. While the details have to be negotiated with Congress, corporate tax reform has broad support among Republicans as well as some Democrats including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has indicated a willingness to cut a deal in return for more domestic spending. According to the Washington Post, Ford officials also said privately that they believe Mr. Trump would ease fuel-economy standards imposed by President Obama in 2012. This would be more good economic news. The onerous mileage rules, which require an average fleet efficiency of nearly 50 miles per gallon by 2025, are up for review next year. Ford has been shifting production of its low-margin small cars that are needed to comply with fuel-economy rules to Mexico where labor costs are lower. Scaling back the regulations would improve Ford<U+2019>s profit margins and allow it to invest more in making more profitable trucks and SUVs in the U.S. Replacing the Affordable Care Act would also be a boon. Ford<U+2019>s health-care costs have been rising fast in part due to ObamaCare<U+2019>s benefit mandates. The United Auto Workers last year estimated that health-care costs per union worker will increase 63% by 2019. The law<U+2019>s 40% tax on expensive <U+201C>Cadillac<U+201D> plans will also take effect in 2018. Escalating health-care costs impinge on business investment and make American workers less competitive. A major caveat here is that Ford has been the most protectionist U.S. car company and vigorously opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would reduce the 25% tariff on Japanese trucks. Ford has also been hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar and urged sanctions on Japan for manipulating its currency, though the yen was overvalued for many years. During his campaign, Mr. Trump accused Japan of <U+201C>monetary manipulation<U+201D> and suggested he might impose tariffs on imports. The U.S. doesn<U+2019>t need politicians dictating where companies can invest, and it would be bad news if Ford<U+2019>s announcement is one half of an implicit bargain in return for an expectation that Mr. Trump will increase tariffs on imported cars. Ford<U+2019>s MKC reversal shows how pursuing pro-growth policies will encourage business investment, but only if it doesn<U+2019>t herald a new era of politicized investment.",

There were actually 4,417 military deaths from 1993-1996 alone under the reign of Clinton. He obviously rubbed off on his wife for not having any respect at all for our brave men and women in uniform. How to turn $12,000 in retirement savings into $1.3 Millon over the next 5 years.... Read More \nHillary also denied air support to soldiers in Benghazi who died horrific deaths while she was Secretary of State. \nAmbassador Chris Stevens was brutally beaten to death and murdered in Benghazi, his lifeless body dragged throughout streets of full-fledged violence, terrorists cheering and applauding. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton and President Obama did nothing . \nExcept for blame the tragedy on a video at the victims<U+2019> military funeral ceremony as their coffins crossed in front of the stage, where Hillary Clinton stood. \nIt was a terrorist attack- the attack came in two separate waves, including suicide bombers. WikiLeaks confirms that Hillary told her daughter that she knew it was not because of <U+2018>some video<U+2019>. \nSo, how else does Bill influence Hillary? Does he encourage her to lie because it<U+2019>s what he personally does? Or does lying simply come naturally for her? \nOver the past month, WikiLeaks has poured out incriminating evidence proving corruption within our liberal government. \nThey<U+2019>ve also released countless emails exposing the fraudulent activities tied to the Clinton Foundation, which is currently being investigated by the FBI. \nWhat other shocking lies have been revealed about the Clintons by WikiLeaks? \n<U+201C>Instead of dark and divisive, it<U+2019>s hopeful and inclusive. It<U+2019>s big-hearted, not small-minded. It is about lifting people up, not putting them down,<U+201D> Hillary Clinton stated in front of a <U+201C>massive<U+201D> crowd in Ohio, unveiled to be photo-shopped to include more people than were actually present by duplicating the ones that were already there.

They bought what she was selling- Americans should not make this grave mistake. This will actually bring about the civil war she speaks of- instead of Haitian immigrants protesting in front of the Clinton Foundation office in NY, all Americans will be protesting in front of the White House in D.C.. \nClinton warned that Trump could bring the nation to war <U+201C>because of his unstable character,<U+201D> which is hilarious. \nAccording to Breitbart , <U+201C>Clinton specifically referred to the Civil War, suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from Donald Trump.<U+201D> \nBreitbart continues, <U+201C>Clinton warned that it would only take a few minutes of instability from Trump launching the United States into a full scale nuclear war.<U+201D> \nHow can she make a leader of another nation so distrusting of her after she sells them 20% of American uranium, aiding them in building the very nuclear technology she claims they will use?

Hillary Clinton is a pathological liar. \nShe lies about everything, it<U+2019>s in her nature. Hillary Clinton is a sociopath that lies for no apparent reason. \nSpeaking of lies, WikiLeaks also proved that the women suddenly accusing Donald Trump of sexual misconduct were paid by the Clintons. \nIt doesn<U+2019>t take the support of deleted emails to show that women suddenly coming forward (against the only other candidate) with just weeks left until a huge election are obviously meant to shift attention away from the real issues of Hillary<U+2019>s email server. \nTrump has overcome lies and scandals perpetrated by Hillary Clinton, spewed by the mainstream media as well as our very own president and guess what? He has kept his cool. Donald J. Trump, American strength and integrity. \nDonald Trump has overcome adversity throughout this presidential campaign and shown incredible strength in his character. He<U+2019>s had to humbly address obvious lies and falsely organized scandals, media slander, biased-coverage, rape-allegations by women he met once and the list just keeps going. \nNot once did President Donald Trump, I mean, republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, get enraged and act like a looney.

By Shane Goldmacher 11/04/16 05:05 AM EDT Hillary Clinton leads in most national polls and in enough battleground states to put her on pace to surpass the 270 electoral votes she needs Tuesday to become the next president. But not far beneath the surface, as Donald Trump has narrowed the gap following the late-breaking FBI announcement of a renewed review of emails related to her private server, lurks a question making Democrats squirm in these frenzied final days. What if the polls are wrong? Story Continued Below And more: What if Clinton<U+2019>s vaunted data operation and ground game don<U+2019>t deliver? What if there is, in fact, a <U+201C>silent majority<U+201D> of Trump fans? What if Clinton<U+2019>s banked stash of early votes is insufficient? What if, as President Barack Obama<U+2019>s former campaign manager David Plouffe not so affectionately describes nervous Democrats, the <U+201C>bed-wetters<U+201D> are right? <U+201C>Our magnificent, historic movement has surprised the world and defied expectations at every single turn,<U+201D> Trump told a crowd in Orlando, Florida, this week. <U+201C>And now, next Tuesday, we will have one more glorious surprise for the pundits, the politicians and the special interests when we win and return the power back to the people.<U+201D> It<U+2019>s an outcome that official Washington <U+2014> more consumed with potential Clinton Cabinet picks (Biden! Sandberg!), her policy agenda, the battle for the Senate <U+2014> seems wholly unprepared for. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think Washington has ever been in touch with this election,<U+201D> said longtime Democratic pollster Peter Hart. <U+201C>I end every speech with the Yogi Berra saying, <U+2018>It ain<U+2019>t over until it<U+2019>s over<U+2019> and it ain<U+2019>t over until we get the votes counted.<U+201D> While Trump remains decidedly the underdog, his path to 270 is not nonexistent. In the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll, Trump trailed by 3 percentage points, shrunken from 9 points behind only weeks ago. <U+201C>The trend lines are clearly going in our direction,<U+201D> Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said this week on MSNBC. By Louis Nelson and Cristiano Lima As Clinton<U+2019>s margin has eroded in recent days, the political focus has shifted from Democratic boasts of flipping Texas, Arizona, Georgia and Utah to safeguarding Michigan, Wisconsin, Colorado, Virginia, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Averages of the public polls in all those latter Democratic states still show Clinton leading <U+2014> albeit by tighter margins <U+2014> which would essentially choke off Trump<U+2019>s path to the White House. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve seen this a couple times where Hillary Clinton is leading by 3 to 5. Something happens. Her numbers spike to 10. They drop back down. Everyone wets themselves. Rinse. Repeat,<U+201D> said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Obama. <U+201C>She was never going to win by 10.<U+201D> Still, Pfeiffer understood the uneasiness, saying he<U+2019>s asked about it everywhere he goes. <U+201C>The consequences of a loss here are much greater than they<U+2019>d be in a normal year,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>You<U+2019>re more nervous if you<U+2019>re playing Russian roulette than flipping a coin.<U+201D> Then there is the fact that polls <U+2014> and polling averages <U+2014> are not infallible. In 2012, Romney led 20 Florida polls in October and November and Obama led in only seven. Obama won the state. And in 2014, in the battle for the Senate majority, pollsters missed the result in race after race far in excess of the margin of error. In Virginia, Sen. Mark Warner had led the polling average by nearly 10 percentage points on Election Day. He won by less than 1 point. In Kentucky, Sen. Mitch McConnell won by nearly 15 points, 8 points ahead of the polling average. In Arkansas, Tom Cotton outperformed the polling average by 10 points. In Kansas, Sen. Pat Roberts trailed the polling average on Election Day, and he won by more than 10 points. Josh Holmes, who served as McConnell<U+2019>s campaign manager and monitored the map nationwide as Republicans retook the Senate majority that year, heeded caution for those trumpeting the demise of Trump already. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s never over,<U+201D> he said. Two years ago, Holmes said, <U+201C>the environment was improving almost every week as we got closer to Election Day, so what you didn<U+2019>t know was which way voters would finally break at the polls.<U+201D> They all broke Republican. 2016 By Steven Shepard <U+201C>You have trends that you can take great confidence in. But two or three or four bad news cycles in a row, some of which you can<U+2019>t control, changes your trend,<U+201D> he said. Trump may have the momentum, but in some battlegrounds it has meant moving him to within the margin of error while still trailing rather than taking an outright lead. As Monmouth University polling director Patrick Murray put it, <U+201C>Right now, it still looks like Clinton is still over that [270] mark. But every single domino falling Trump<U+2019>s way would give him the win.<U+201D> Sophisticated campaigns these days rely less on polling alone and more on a combination of surveys and modeling the electorate <U+2014> predicting who will turn out and how they<U+2019>ll vote. Clinton<U+2019>s data department runs hundreds of thousands of election simulations nightly, and those caused the campaign to withdraw from the Virginia and Colorado airwaves weeks ago (her super PAC withdrew, as well). Now, her campaign has returned to the airwaves there in this final stretch as Trump is buying ads there, too. Both the type and volume of voters who turn out in midterms and presidential elections are completely different, as tens of millions more people vote when the White House is at stake.

President Barack Obama, for example, named his chief of staff two days after winning the 2008 campaign. Inside the Trump transition team, a broader group of officials known as the <U+201C>landing team<U+201D> was supposed to have been announced on Friday and start inspecting agencies for potential changes this coming week. That was delayed after Mr. Trump shuffled the transition team<U+2019>s leadership. Another contributing factor: Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory surprised even his own top advisers, who, before Tuesday, were unable to focus the New York businessman on the 73 days between the election and inauguration, a senior aide said. They said Mr. Trump didn<U+2019>t want to jinx himself by planning the transition before he had actually won. During their private White House meeting on Thursday, Mr. Obama walked his successor through the duties of running the country , and Mr. Trump seemed surprised by the scope, said people familiar with the meeting. Trump aides were described by those people as unaware that the entire presidential staff working in the West Wing had to be replaced at the end of Mr. Obama<U+2019>s term. After meeting with Mr. Trump, the only person to be elected president without having held a government or military position, Mr. Obama realized the Republican needs more guidance. He plans to spend more time with his successor than presidents typically do, people familiar with the matter said. Jason Miller, communications director for the Trump transition, declined to comment on those characterizations of the White House visit. He said in a statement that, <U+201C>The difference between President-elect Trump and a politician is that Trump puts a premium on making the right decision, not the politically expedient one. President-elect Trump<U+2019>s excellent judgment and temperament has served him well in business and in life, and he<U+2019>s not going to be swayed by a bunch of political insiders responsible for filling up the swamp in the first place.<U+201D> There are signs that Mr. Trump has tempered several of his top campaign promises . He vowed during the campaign to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but he said in a <U+201C>60 Minutes<U+201D> interview broadcast Sunday that a fence could be sufficient in some parts. He also told CBS that he is rethinking his call to have a prosecutor investigate Hillary Clinton , saying of the Clintons that <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t want to hurt them<U+201D> and <U+201C>they<U+2019>re good people.<U+201D> Still, he said in the interview that he would aim to jail or deport between two million and three million illegal immigrants whom he described as criminals, gang members and drug dealers. He didn<U+2019>t specify how he would do this. The Obama administration already has made deporting illegal immigrants with criminal records a priority. The selection of Mr. Priebus will, by definition, help organize the transition. This decision allows Mr. Trump and his team to focus on identifying 15 cabinet positions and more than 1,000 top posts that must be confirmed by the Senate. Born: Education: Political career: Personal background: Trump ties: A trained attorney, Mr. Priebus first interacted with the Trump inner circle in September 2015 when he persuaded the political neophyte to sign a pledge to support the GOP nominee, even if he lost the primary. He was among a small group inside a glass-encased Trump Tower conference room with Mr. Trump when they were informed the Washington Post was preparing to publish an 11-year-old video in which the nominee made lewd comments about forcing himself on women . As the rest of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s team strategized the response, Mr. Priebus was largely sidelined by an avalanche of calls and emails from top Republicans urging him to pull the party<U+2019>s funding from the Trump campaign. While Mr. Priebus<U+2019>s elevation is a nod to the Washington establishment, Mr. Bannon brings a more disruptive political force into the White House. The former Goldman Sachs banker became chairman of the Trump campaign in late summer, leaving his position atop Breitbart News. That website has taken aim at establishment GOP figures and is identified with the <U+201C>alt right,<U+201D> a movement that promotes nativism and views immigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity. After he joined the campaign, Mr. Bannon pushed Mr. Trump to focus on white working-class voters and was instrumental in assembling a surprise news conference just hours before a presidential debate that featured Mr. Trump and several women who had accused his rival<U+2019>s husband , former President Bill Clinton, of sexual misconduct. At the news conference, Mr. Bannon, wearing glasses and pushing his hands into his jacket pockets, flashed a mischievous smile as stunned reporters<U+2014>who had been told they would be witnessing debate preparations<U+2014>surveyed the room. <U+201C>Bannon is going to be keeper of the image of Trump as a fighter against the status quo, and Reince is going to utilize his personal connections with the speaker and others, to make the trains run on time,<U+201D> said Ken Blackwell, a former Ohio state official and a member of the transition team. While other former campaign officials met in New York on Sunday, the broader transition staff based in Washington gathers on Monday. They will discuss the so-called landing teams tasked with entering federal agencies and reporting back on potential changes. Friday<U+2019>s reorganization of the transition team increased the influence of Mr. Pence and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.), who now has several allies holding top staff positions. The role for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had been in charge of the transition, has been diluted. The slower decision-making process is also amplified by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s lack of public appearances since the election, even as protests erupt around the country following his election. While Mr. Obama and his predecessor, Republican George W. Bush in 2000, used constant news conferences after their victories to speak to Americans, Mr. Trump has held none, only doing a Wall Street Journal interview and the <U+201C>60 Minutes<U+201D> appearance. On Sunday, Mr. Trump noted that he had received congratulatory calls from Republicans who were opposed to his candidacy. Mr. Trump said primary rival Jeb Bush and his father and brother, the two most recent Republican presidents, all called <U+201C>to express their best wishes.<U+201D> Mitt Romney, the party<U+2019>s 2012 nominee, also called to offer his congratulations. <U+2014>Damian Paletta contributed to this article.

She tells us she<U+2019>s sorry, but she<U+2019>s not. Because her feelings about this campaign are more important. Read how she describes her situation: \nI committed a crime this month, along with two of my friends. I<U+2019>m not the lawbreaking type. In fact, as a 52-year-old mom, my life is pretty predictable and boring. But this election, a particular candidate<U+2019>s boasts about women pushed me over the edge. \nIn the suburban, upper-middle-class part of Maine where I live, Republicans and Democrats live together mostly in harmony. In every election cycle, there<U+2019>s some tension. But the 2016 presidential campaign has been different. Tensions in my town are running at a fevered pitch. \nWhich is how three middle-aged moms came to be running down the road, tearing up the Donald Trump signs along our version of Main Street. We<U+2019>d been talking about the infamous Billy Bush tape and the women who have since come forward to share their own stories of abuse. We were angry. Getting Trump<U+2019>s name off our median strip seemed like the best way to express our rage. \nThese three women must have been proud of themselves, probably laughing heartily as they committed theft, trespassing and violated the First Amendment of their neighbors. Why? Because she thinks she was assaulted by the signs. \nIn retrospect, I realize I shouldn<U+2019>t be proud of my transgression. Hanging out with a bunch of moms, we started grousing about the proliferation of signs. Can you believe someone would put that many Trump signs so close together on our roads? It<U+2019>s so rude. Who is this jerk? We felt assaulted by the number of signs . The idea of <U+201C>cleansing<U+201D> our streets seemed like the fastest way to restore balance and alleviate our election stress <U+2014> at least, that night it did. \n<U+201C> Assaulted<U+201D> ? This is exactly why the Left is so dangerous. They are <U+201C>assaulted<U+201D> by ideas <U+2013> by mere thoughts or opinions that are not their own. They will do anything- and Ms. Stothart did <U+2013> to silence any dissent. \nAnd she writes that <U+201C> in retrospect, I realize I shouldn<U+2019>t be proud of my transgression. <U+201D> \nShe doesn<U+2019>t say she isn<U+2019>t proud, she merely tells us that in retrospect she shouldn<U+2019>t be proud. \nWhich tells us that she is . She is proud of what she did. \nWhen asked what she would say to the victims of her trespassing and theft, she offers no apology, merely a justification that Trump is bad, and that because she herself was a victim of an unwanted sexual advance, it justifies her behavior. \nShe claims she<U+2019>ll go to court in December with some sense of humility and shame <U+2013> she<U+2019>ll <U+201C>explain<U+201D> and <U+201C>apologize.<U+201D> \nBut she<U+2019>s not sorry. Not really. \nTo her <U+2013> and the millions of Leftists like her <U+2013> the ends justify the means. Silence dissent, crush the opposition, tear down and destroy any thing that strays from your worldview. \nThis is the world that Ms. Stothart lives in. She still lives in it today. She takes pride in suppressing the political view of her fellow Americans. \nShe writes that the <U+201C>agitation and fear is rising on both sides.<U+201D> \nNo, Ms. Stothart. I have yet to see a single story about a Trump supporter violating the Constitutional rights of a Hillary Clinton supporter by stealing yard signs. \nThis is liberal America. This is Ms. Stothart<U+2019>s America. \nThis is not the America I want to live in.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Michael Grunwald \n source: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-said-mike-pence-claimed-did-not-229171 \n text: By Henry C. Jackson 10/05/16 01:40 AM EDT Tim Kaine came into the vice presidential debate with a clear goal: make Mike Pence own all of Trump<U+2019>s most controversial moments. But Kaine was unable, with Pence successfully parrying his attacks as the debate dissolved into a string of interruptions and contradictions with each of the candidates peppering the other with rhetoric but neither landing a knockout. After, Pence was lauded for his debating acumen, and on efficacy, the strategy scores high. Story Continued Below Scored on accuracy, however, Pence fares far worse. The main tenet of his strategy was to deny that Trump ever said these things to begin with <U+2014> despite the fact that many of the statements were both real and a part of the public record. Here are six Trump statements that Pence attempted to tweak, massage or erase all together. 1. Tax Returns. Tim Kaine said: <U+201C>Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, if I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes. He's broken his first promise.<U+201D> Mike Pence said: <U+201C>He hasn<U+2019>t broken his promise.<U+201D> What Trump<U+2019>s actually said: In 2014, while sitting down with an Irish television station, Donald Trump said , <U+201C>If I decide to run for office, I will release my tax returns. Absolutely.<U+201D> Adding, <U+201C>I would love to do that.<U+201D> While saying he will release his tax returns when a federal audit is complete, Trump<U+2019>s surrogates, including his son , have implied that won<U+2019>t actually happen. Trump also has said that only the media cares about his tax returns. \"As far as my taxes are concerned, the only one that cares is the press, I will tell you,<U+201D> Trump said in September. And even the press, I tell you, it's not a big deal.\" 2. Social Security. Tim Kaine said: <U+201C>Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.<U+201D> Mike Pence said: <U+201C>All Donald Trump and I have said about social security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors. That's it.<U+201D> What Trump actually said: While describing Social Security in his 2000 book <U+201C>The America We Deserve<U+201D> Trump said of Social Security, <U+201C>Does the name Ponzi all of a sudden come to mind?<U+201D> 3. Insults. Tim Kaine said: <U+201C>Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He's called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting ... He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican. He went after John McCain, a P.O.W., and said he wasn<U+2019>t a hero because he'd been captured.<U+201D> Mike Pence said: <U+201C>To be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all the things that you said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of of our supporters were a basket of deplorables.<U+201D> What Trump actually said: Trump called <U+201C>some<U+201D> Mexican illegal immigrants <U+201C>rapists<U+201D> and <U+201C>criminals,<U+201D> and some, he assumed, <U+201C>good people.<U+201D> He has used a variety of insults for women. Trump came under fire earlier this year for claiming an Indiana-born federal judge<U+2019>s Mexican ancestry made him unable to fairly hear a case about Trump. And regarding John McCain, Trump said : <U+201C>He<U+2019>s not a war hero <U+2026> He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren<U+2019>t captured.<U+201D> 4. Putin. Tim Kaine said: <U+201C>You've got to be tough on Russia. So let<U+2019>s start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader. Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he's a great leader.<U+201D> Mike Pence said: <U+201C>No, we haven't.<U+201D> What Trump actually said: Trump has repeatedly praised Putin<U+2019>s strength and has called him <U+201C>a leader, far more than our president has been.<U+201D> Pence also said he thought it was <U+201C>inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country.\" 5. Nuclear weapons. What Tim Kaine said: <U+201C>Donald Trump's idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea.<U+201D> He also claimed Trump had said <U+201C>more nations should get nuclear weapons.<U+201D> What Pence said: <U+201C>Well, he never said that, Senator.<U+201D> What Trump actually said: In a March interview with The New York Times and subsequent Republican town hall on CNN , Trump suggested it would be good for Japan and South Korea to have nuclear weapons. <U+201C>I think maybe it<U+2019>s not so bad to have Japan <U+2014> if Japan had that nuclear threat, I<U+2019>m not sure that would be a bad thing for us,<U+201D> Trump said. Trump stopped short of promoting nuclear weapons for Saudi Arabia, but he did say it was inevitable and that the country needed to be able to defend itself. 6. Abortion. What Tim Kaine said Donald has said <U+201C>women should be punished ... for making the decision to have an abortion.<U+201D> What Pence said: <U+201C>Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heart-breaking choice to end a pregnancy.<U+201D> What Trump actually said: Trump in March said abortion <U+201C>is a very serious problem, and it<U+2019>s a problem we have to decide on <U+2026>There has to be some form of punishment.<U+201D> But he quickly walked that statement back saying, <U+201C>This issue is unclear and should be put back into the states for determination.<U+201D> Off Message By Glenn Thrush By Michael Grunwald By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz",

Yet every gardener faces problems in the early stages of starting a garden. Look out for these 5 mistakes during your first few weeks. \n\nMold \nYou can spot fungi by first being able to identify it. If you see white, hairlike growths on the soil surface, you are probably seeing fungi. Fungus thrives in dirt that is overly wet, usually combined with humid air or poor ventilation around plants. You can avoid this by using cell flats and planting one seed per cell to allow enough space for air to circulate around seedlings. Place a small fan in the area and position it so that it is not blowing directly on the seedlings. This will keep air moving. \n\nDamping-Off \nStems can turn brown and bend at the soil level due to fungi. If you are using a humidity dome, be sure to remove it right after sprouting. Leaving the dome on will create an environment that pathogens and pests love. \n\nBugs \nIf you have houseplants with pest issues, keep your seedling trays far away from them. The most common indoor seed-starting pest is the fungus gnat. It resembles a small but sluggish fruit fly. Gnat larvae can only survive in moist environments, so it is important to cut back on watering once the seeds have sprouted. Allow the top 1/4 inch of soil to dry out between waterings. \n\nPlanting Depth \nWhen seeds are planted too deep and kept too moist and cold, they can rot. Be sure to plant according to the directions on the packet. \n\nSeed Quality \nIf you are doing everything right and your seeds still don<U+2019>t sprout, they could be too old. Seeds germinate best when they are fresh. Quality seed companies print a <U+201C>packed for<U+201D> date on envelopes. Be sure to do your research. Some seeds like beans, lettuce, tomatoes, and peppers can be stored in a sealed bag in a dry, dark place for several years. \n\nHave fun while gardening and learn what techniques work best for you and your crop. Pay attention to detail in order to catch any issues before they spread. \n\n\nAriana Marisol is a contributing staff writer for REALfarmacy.com.

        "input": "time: null \n author: James Taranto \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/11-alarm-fire-1478280600 \n text: <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve got Republican friends who don<U+2019>t think or act the way Donald Trump does,<U+201D> President Obama said Wednesday at a Raleigh rally for Hillary Clinton. That<U+2019>s totally believable except the part about his having Republican friends. The president continued: <U+201C>This<U+201D><U+2014>meaning Trump, not Mrs. Clinton<U+2014><U+201C>is somebody who is uniquely unqualified. I ran against John McCain. I ran against Mitt Romney. I thought I<U+2019>d be a better president, but I never thought that the republic was at risk if they were elected.<U+201D> National Review<U+2019>s Charles Cooke finds Obama<U+2019>s remarks vexatious. <U+201C>Democrats really have limited their ability to credibly warn against the dangers posed by Trump,<U+201D> he argues, noting that Obama and his supporters treated Romney quite viciously in 2012: If we understand Cooke correctly, he is frustrated with liberals because he largely agrees with them about Trump<U+2014>note he accepts the premise about the <U+201C>dangers posed<U+201D> by the GOP nominee<U+2014>and finds the case more difficult to make persuasively because their lack of credibility tends to discredit his argument. To put it in fabulous terms, liberals cried wolf, and now that there really is a wolf, nobody is listening to Cooke<U+2019>s cries. Follow James on Twitter To judge by the Twitter exchanges we read yesterday, Cooke did not find a receptive audience on the left. Some detractors argued that Romney was a dangerous radical, which illustrates Cooke<U+2019>s point without conceding it. Others claimed that the anti-Romney rhetoric then was not actually as harsh as the anti-Trump rhetoric now. Although this column has also criticized the left (in February and September ) for crying wolf, it seems to us the latter group has a bit of a point. Our (admittedly subjective) sense is that the left has been denouncing Trump more harshly than it denounced Romney. The most recent examples to cross our desk are the New York Times<U+2019>s Charles Blow , who calls Trump <U+201C>an existential threat,<U+201D> and the New Yorker<U+2019>s Adam Gopnik , who describes the nominee as <U+201C>an open and committed enemy of liberal democracy and constitutional republicanism.<U+201D> To our mind, there is at least a difference in degree between the 2012 attacks and the 2016 ones. Whereas the volume of the Romney attacks was at 8 or 9, now they<U+2019>ve cranked it up to 11. You can see why conservatives and liberals might experience that differently: Whereas the left needed expensive new equipment to get the volume boost, to the right it<U+2019>s an intolerable racket either way. Another difference between 2012 and 2016 is the role of the so-called mainstream media. There, the volume boost has gone to 11 from something more like 5 or 6. We<U+2019>ve written often about that in the past but were surprised to find this in Vanity Fair of all places, from Ken Stern : We<U+2019>re not sure why Stern limits his hypothetical to a <U+201C>non-traditional candidate.<U+201D> We can easily imagine, say, the New York Times taking an openly adversarial approach to, say, John Kasich or Marco Rubio running in 2020 to succeed President Kaine. The move away from objectivity and toward partisanship didn<U+2019>t start after Trump became a candidate. Press theorists have been bemoaning <U+201C>false balance<U+201D> (i.e., balance) for years, and the <U+201C>fact check<U+201D> genre<U+2014>opinion journalism, often of low quality, with a pretense of authoritativeness<U+2014>was invented more than a decade ago. Stern<U+2019>s analysis presupposes that Mrs. Clinton will win. That assumption also helps explain why liberals do not care to take Cooke<U+2019>s argument seriously: If Trump loses, it makes no difference, at least in the short term, whether the left<U+2019>s criticisms of him have been credible; and if their overwrought attacks on Romney and other past Republicans indirectly led to Trump<U+2019>s nomination, that<U+2019>s a win-win from the Democratic standpoint. But wait. As this column revealed Tuesday , Trump could win. That<U+2019>s not even a contrarian view anymore: FiveThirtyEight<U+2019>s Nate Silver , no conservative, had a post last night titled <U+201C>Election Update: Why Clinton<U+2019>s Position Is Worse Than Obama<U+2019>s,<U+201D> meaning Obama<U+2019>s the week before the election in 2012: CNN notes there<U+2019>s also a new Colorado poll showing the two nominees tied at 39%. As of early Friday afternoon, Silver gives Trump close to a 1 in 3 chance of winning. Mrs. Clinton is the favorite, but not a prohibitive one. What if Trump wins? It<U+2019>s a safe bet the media would remain adversarial, which is largely to the good; it would be refreshing to see journalists challenge those in power for a change. But here<U+2019>s the more interesting question: What if he wins and he turns out not to be as bad as the liberals and Nevertrump conservatives fear? We don<U+2019>t mean to suggest a Trump presidency would be trouble-free, but his detractors have set an awfully high bar for awfulness. It is possible he would meet it<U+2014>but if the world and the republic survive the administration of President Trump, it<U+2019>ll be really hard to get anyone alarmed when the next wolf comes along.

This was a hoax and we look forward to receiving a formal retraction and apology from all involved,<U+201D> said Trump spokesman Jason Miller. Jaworowski said she recently met a man of Serbian descent at a fundraiser who insisted he was running to be president of the Balkan nation and who had expressed interest in supporting the campaign.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Jason Douglas \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-the-u-ks-treasury-chief-1479880802 \n text: U.K. Treasury chief Philip Hammond is Wednesday due to lay out the government<U+2019>s first set of tax and spending plans since voters<U+2019> June decision to exit from the European Union. In a regular <U+201C>autumn statement<U+201D> to parliament, the chancellor of the exchequer will offer the first concrete insight into how Prime Minister Theresa May <U+2019>s administration expects the Brexit process to affect the economy, and how it intends to respond. Here are five things to look out for: The U.K.<U+2019>s Office for Budget Responsibility is an independent outfit that produces the U.K.<U+2019>s official economic forecasts. Since those forecasts usually cover the next five years, the agency has the tricky task on Wednesday of predicting where the U.K. economy is headed after the country<U+2019>s anticipated exit from the EU in 2019. That means its predictions for growth and the public finances will depend heavily on its assumptions about the likely hit from Brexit and what the U.K.<U+2019>s future ties to the EU will look like. Many economists expect Brexit to slow the economy and widen the shortfall between public spending and tax receipts in the coming years, absent some further belt-tightening by the government. Mr. Hammond has already ditched his predecessor<U+2019>s target of running a budget surplus by 2020. But he has also stressed the need to maintain fiscal discipline in an economy with a government budget deficit close to 4% of annual national income. He has signaled that his solution will be a new, flexible set of fiscal rules to govern tax and spending policy, and provide businesses with some certainty to make plans for the future. Mr. Hammond has said he wants the economy to be <U+201C>match-fit<U+201D> for the coming exit negotiations. Many economists say the Brexit vote is likely to hurt business investment, given the uncertainty surrounding the U.K.<U+2019>s economic relationship to the EU, its biggest trading partner. Soon after taking office, Mr. Hammond acknowledged this risk and signaled that supporting investment was a priority. Mrs. May, in a speech Monday, went further, confirming the government plans to continue trimming corporate tax rates to encourage companies to hire and invest here. Mr. Hammond has talked up the need for targeted infrastructure investment to support growth in the short term and provide a long-term lift to British productivity, which has, since the financial crisis, languished well below its rich-country peers. The Treasury has already announced road and broadband investments but more can be expected. The Brexit vote, much like U.S. President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s success in this month<U+2019>s election, was animated in part by a distrust of political elites and a perception that the spoils of growth aren<U+2019>t being equitably shared. Mr. Hammond must therefore help Mrs. May deliver on her pledge to do more for voters feeling left behind by rapid globalization and ignored by the London establishment. The Treasury early Thursday trailed that a package of measures targeted at working families will be included in the autumn statement, including a home-building project and a higher national minimum wage for workers over 25.

It has also highlighted some fundamental truths about the United States circa 2016, lessons that political leaders should heed beyond Tuesday<U+2019>s elections. Hate sells. Racism, bigotry and misogyny, Donald Trump has proved, can energize a national campaign. Mr. Trump has shown it is feasible to recruit the alt-right, conspiracy theorists, white supremacists and anti-Semites as ferocious allies without alienating reliable Republican voters. Economic anxiety is high. Americans of all backgrounds <U+2014> whites, blacks, Latinos, men, women, people in rural and urban communities <U+2014> have this in common: They are worried about their economic future. The country recently experienced the longest recession since the Great Depression, incomes had been falling or stagnant for years and income inequality in recent years has been worse than at any other time since the 1920s. All the candidates, Republican and Democrat, have sought to make this issue central to their campaigns. But Mr. Trump has outdone even Bernie Sanders in tapping this anxiety. While economic worries cut across all demographic lines, he has gotten away with exploiting the real concerns by attacking immigrants and trade agreements, but offering no cogent policies for creating good jobs and lifting wages. His economic and tax proposals would hurt ordinary workers and blow a hole through the federal budget. By contrast, Hillary Clinton has offered practical ideas that could improve the economic situation for most Americans. The media enable extreme candidates and the parties are too fragile to stop them. Social media sites and TV news transmitted every political spitball and insult spewed over the past 18 months. But they had little capacity to establish widely shared truths or foster constructive debate about issues like climate change or criminal justice. In democratizing the media, Twitter and Facebook have also made it possible for Americans to encounter only the messages they want to hear. Desperate for ratings, Fox News, CNN and other networks handed Mr. Trump an open mike early in the contest. And having fanned the flames of extreme partisanship for years, Republican leaders were powerless in the primaries to stop Mr. Trump<U+2019>s rise, and then were afraid to alienate his supporters by opposing him in the general election. Mr. Trump used his media savvy and entertainment value <U+2014> often in the form of insults <U+2014> to keep all eyes on him. Imagine how much further a more disciplined demagogue might go applying a similar formula. Hispanic turnout is rising. Here<U+2019>s a bright spot. Early voter turnout during the last few days in states like Nevada and Florida suggest that Hispanics are voting at much higher rates in this election than they did in the past. This shows that the Latino vote can mobilize, and it could be pivotal in delivering the loss Mr. Trump deserves. How fitting that would be. Citizens are turning to local solutions. The presidential election is not the only consequential choice before voters. In fact, tens of millions of people across the country on Tuesday have a chance to take matters into their own hands by voting on ballot proposals that could change their lives and communities. Voters in nine states will consider measures to turn around the failed war on drugs by permitting the medical or recreational use of marijuana. Cities and counties, including Los Angeles and Seattle, will be voting on financing rail lines and other desperately needed transportation projects. Washington State will vote on taxing carbon pollution. Elsewhere, people will vote on stronger gun control policies and raising state minimum wages. These proposals are a powerful response to the anti-government zealots who have hogtied Congress into inaction on anything besides futile, partisan investigations. For deeply frustrated citizens, this end run around political dysfunction may be the only way to move the country forward.

Citing higher-than-expected expenses, Ms. Stein<U+2019>s campaign said it would be asking for an additional $2.4 million from donors to support recount efforts in three states , including Wisconsin , bringing total estimated costs to $9.5 million. The new amount represents the second time that Ms. Stein has increased the amount of money she said will be required for the audits. She originally sought $2.5 million. <U+201C>We will be alerting recount advocates that we must now raise an additional $2.4 million to cover this new extraordinary burden in Wisconsin,<U+201D> Ms. Stein said. Ms. Stein<U+2019>s campaign initiated recount efforts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania last week after a prominent computer scientist raised hypothetical concerns about the possibility that voting machines were hacked. Though no evidence exists of any hack, a group of election lawyers and computer scientists encouraged recounts and forensic examinations to conclusively show that the November elections were free of interference. Having successfully filed and paid for a Wisconsin recount, Ms. Stein plans to do the same in Michigan on Wednesday. Her campaign hit a major roadblock in Pennsylvania, where supporters filed for recounts covering only a fraction of the state. State law requires three voters in each election district to file a complaint. The only way for a full recount in Pennsylvania now involves a lawsuit in state court, something the effort<U+2019>s lawyer acknowledged is an uphill battle. A judge on Monday will hear arguments in a case brought by dozens of Pennsylvania voters who argue that the election was conducted illegally. Republicans on Capitol Hill in Washington dismissed the recount effort, which Ms. Stein insists isn<U+2019>t aimed at swinging the election results. <U+201C>I think it is sad to see the Green Party and the Democratic Party acting like sore losers. We had an election. It was decided fair and square. And the American people overwhelmingly voted to elect Donald Trump the next president,<U+201D> said Sen.

Rights Expert Urges Nations Not to Sign <U+2018>Flawed<U+2019> CETA Treaty GENEVA (28 October 2016) <U+2013> The trade deal set to be signed by the European Union and Canada is a corporate-driven, fundamentally flawed treaty which should not be signed or ratified without a referendum in each country concerned, a United Nations human rights expert says. Alfred de Zayas, the UN Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, deplored the pressures brought on the Belgian regional parliament of Wallonia, which initially said it would not approve the treaty but later said its concerns had been met. <U+201C>A culture of bullying and intimidation becomes apparent when it comes to trade agreements that currently get priority over human rights,<U+201D> the expert said. In his reports to the Human Rights Council and General Assembly Mr. de Zayas has previously warned that CETA is incompatible with the rule of law, democracy and human rights, and substantiated how and why before the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. He believes that both CETA and TTIP <U+2013> the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership currently being negotiated by the EU and the US <U+2013> give undue power to corporations at the expense of national governments and human rights, and deplores that the mere existence of investor-state dispute settlement generates a regulatory chill. <U+201C>The danger of CETA and TTIP being signed and one day entering into force is so serious that every stakeholder, especially parliamentarians from EU Member States, should now be given the opportunity to articulate the pros and cons. The corporate-driven agenda gravely endangers labour, health and other social legislation, and there is no justification to fast-track it<U+201D> Mr. de Zayas said. <U+201C>Civil society should demand referendums on the approval of CETA or any other such mega-treaty that has been negotiated behind closed doors,<U+201D> he noted. The expert said the EU should have heeded expert warnings and strong civil society opposition to CETA. His specific concerns include provisions which he says could hamper States<U+2019> regulatory powers and could allow investment companies to sue over legislation affecting profits, even in cases where the laws were designed to protect workers<U+2019> rights, public health or the environment. States should not sign the agreement unless their powers to regulate and legislate in the public interest are fully safeguarded and the so-called <U+201C>investment protection<U+201D> chapter is removed. <U+201C>This chapter creates privileges for investors at the expense of the public,<U+201D> said Mr. de Zayas, noting that the new text may slightly amend this chapter but adding that the Investment Court System (ICS) is similarly incompatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which requires legal cases to be heard by transparent, accountable, independent public tribunals. <U+201C>The associations of German and Spanish judges have already decried this kind of investor-State dispute settlement, which is a one-way street, and also discriminates against domestic enterprises, Moreover, ICS is not necessary when all participating States are parties to the ICCPR and already have public courts that are independent, transparent and accountable,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>CETA <U+2013> along with most trade and investment agreements <U+2013> is fundamentally flawed unless specific provision stipulates that the regulatory power of States is paramount and must not be impacted by a regulatory chill. It must also be clear that in case of conflict between commercial treaties and human rights treaties, it is the latter that must prevail.<U+201D> The expert said there was now a strengthened case for a legally binding instrument on corporate social responsibility, obliging transnational corporations not to interfere in the internal affairs of States, and imposing sanctions when they pollute the environment or shift their profits into tax havens. The Human Rights Council has established an inter-governmental working group on transnational corporations, which is holding its second session this week. Mr. de Zayas, who has participated in this working group, urges the prompt adoption of a treaty that makes the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights legally binding and enforceable. He also said it was time to discuss the secrecy surrounding the drawing up of the CETA treaty, and the anomaly that much of the information about it became available only through whistleblowers, in violation of State obligations to ensure open access to information. <U+201C>The constitutionality of the CETA and TTIP agreements should be tested before the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, and the human rights aspects before the European Court of Human Rights, which could be called upon to issue interim measures of protection,<U+201D> said Mr. de Zayas. <U+201C>National courts should also test the compatibility of the agreements with national constitutions,<U+201D> the Independent Expert stated. <U+201C>There is a legitimate fear that CETA will dilute environmental standards, food security, and health and labour protection,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>A treaty that strengthens the position of investors, transnational corporations and monopolies at the expense of the public interest conflicts with the duty of States to protect all people under their jurisdiction from internal and external threats.<U+201D> Mr. de Zayas said the EU should have paid greater attention to a warning from a committee of Members of Parliament from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The Committee on Social Affairs, Health and Sustainable Development said earlier this month that CETA imposed unacceptable restrictions on the legislative powers of national parliaments, and called for the signing to be postponed.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Alison Sider Timothy Puko \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/market-to-opec-make-a-deal-or-price-rout-resumes-1479304929 \n text: For oil prices that have been retreating for most of the past month, OPEC is shaping up as the last line of defense. U.S. crude prices have lost more than 11% in four weeks. Oil prices tumbled after data showed U.S. inventories rising and U.S. producers putting more rigs back to work. They continued falling as the dollar rallied, a move that makes oil more expensive for foreign buyers. But the biggest factor in oil<U+2019>s retreat, many traders say, has been growing skepticism that members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries can reach a deal to cut output at their Nov. 30 meeting. OPEC leaders have elaborated little in recent weeks on their tentative plan reached in late September to limit crude production to between 32.5 million to 33 million barrels a day. Meanwhile, cartel members have been pumping at full tilt. Production reached a record 33.83 million barrels a day in October, according to the International Energy Agency. That means OPEC would have to cut back more than 800,000 barrels day to reach its stated goal. The group<U+2019>s behavior is raising doubts that it is prepared to reach a deal that will cut output deep enough to rebalance a market that has been well oversupplied. <U+201C>Fundamentally, I see very little reason for a rally anytime soon outside of OPEC,<U+201D> said Mark Anderle, director of supply and trading at TAC Energy. OPEC may be getting the message. U.S. crude futures rallied 5.75% on Tuesday following media reports that cartel members are working on details of their proposed production cut. That was oil<U+2019>s biggest one-day percentage gain since April. Prices began to rise again Wednesday after Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak indicated that Russia is ready to support an OPEC deal. But without new evidence of progress, his comments were not enough to outweigh new data showing swelling U.S. supplies, and U.S. oil prices sputtered, losing 0.5%. The group<U+2019>s pledge to rein in output has been one of the few recent bright spots for oil. Crude prices climbed more than 15% to $51.60<U+2014>their highest settlement price since July 2015<U+2014>during the three weeks after OPEC announced its plan to cut production. Those gains enabled crude to pierce the price ceiling of around $50 that had held since April. But oil mostly has sat out a post-U.S. election rally, which has boosted the price of stocks, industrial metals and other assets that rose in response to President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s fiscal-stimulus proposals that the markets hope will bring economic expansion and inflation. Now the growing concern is that a lack of OPEC follow-through on its pledge to cut could drag prices below the $40 floor that has also held for months. <U+201C>Supply is rearing its head again,<U+201D> said Kris Kelley, an energy analyst at Janus Capital Group. <U+201C>Now the onus to cut production is a lot higher.<U+201D> A report released Wednesday by the Energy Information Administration showed that U.S. crude-oil stockpiles rose by 5.3 million barrels for the week ended Nov. 11 to 490.3 million barrels, which is above the upper limit of the average range for this time of year. Skeptics point out that, even if OPEC members reach an agreement, previous efforts to reduce output weren<U+2019>t always well-enforced. Countries often traded accusations of cheating. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s been such an ineffective cartel for so long, I don<U+2019>t think people are going to believe it,<U+201D> Mr. Kelley said. OPEC representatives didn<U+2019>t respond to requests seeking comment. Others worry that a cut could result in only short-term price gains, eventually triggering more output from U.S. shale companies that many analysts view as the new swing producers. Analysts say this is already showing up in domestic production. U.S. output jumped 2% in the week ended Nov. 4, though it fell slightly last week, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Not all investors are this pessimistic. Nick Koutsoftas, portfolio manager at Cohen & Steers, said many investors have already prepared for the OPEC deal to collapse. In the week ended Nov. 8, money managers added a record number of bearish bets on oil, 82,791 new positions, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released Monday. That could lead oil prices to hold or even rise, no matter what OPEC does on Nov. 30. Mr. Koutsoftas expects crude prices could return to $50 a barrel by year-end, with oil demand catching up to supply by the end of next year. <U+201C>Even if they did absolutely nothing, I think the market has already discounted that, and that<U+2019>s what we<U+2019>ve seen over the last month with the price of oil coming down,<U+201D> Mr. Koutsoftas said. Some analysts think that demand has already caught up to daily supply, at least excluding the excess capacity in storage. PIRA Energy Group said global crude supply is already 400,000 barrels a day less than demand, a shortage likely to grow next year. Others say focusing on OPEC misses the point. Because most of the cartel<U+2019>s members are already pumping as much as they can, there is little risk that the floodgates will open in the absence of a production agreement, said Robin Wehb<U+00E9>, portfolio manager at the Boston Company Asset Management. <U+201C>The narrative now is we<U+2019>re looking for OPEC to save the market, and everyone feels it<U+2019>s in OPEC<U+2019>s hands,<U+201D> Mr. Wehb<U+00E9> said. But <U+201C>the reality is, they lost the ability to control the market a decade ago.<U+201D> Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com and Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com",

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-economic-view-of-a-fed-governor-1479784380 \n text: Expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its December policy meeting have grown recently, fueled by the reaction in financial markets to Donald Trump <U+2019>s victory in the U.S. presidential election. Neil King, global economics editor at The Wall Street Journal, sat down with Fed governor Daniel Tarullo to discuss the postelection landscape and what it might mean for the economy and monetary policy. Edited excerpts follow. A full transcript of the conversation also is available. MR. KING: What is just your basic sense of the strength of the U.S. economy? MR. TARULLO : We<U+2019>ve had an unusual recovery from what was obviously a very unusual recession, one driven by a financial crisis, rather than by the normal pattern of inflation moving up and the Fed hitting the brakes. And during that period, we<U+2019>ve never had what people call the Nike recovery, where there is a very steep upward trajectory. Instead, growth has been modestly above trend for some time. My perspective for a couple of years now had been that there was more room to run. There was more slack in the labor market. There was more utility in getting demand strengthened by having incomes up and more people having jobs. And we weren<U+2019>t really close to our inflation target and hadn<U+2019>t been for some time. But over the last three or four months, I<U+2019>ve seen changes in that pattern. Core inflation is up some. After a long period of relatively little wage growth, at least one of the measures has shown some upward movement. And we<U+2019>ve seen the actual labor-force participation rate approach, and by some measures maybe even slightly exceed, the expected trend of labor-force participation. All of that has suggested to me that we<U+2019>re in a somewhat different situation than I thought we were six or eight or 10 or 12 months ago. And so now, I think the discussion of when is the appropriate time to raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating too much is more on the table than it may have been before. That said, there are some grounds for caution. We still have fewer tools to respond if a recession were to come from some external source than we do ability to control inflation. There is still some slack in the labor market, although not as much as before. We obviously don<U+2019>t want to be pushing on the brakes harder than we need to in order to continue the trend of moderate growth. MR. KING: One of the Fed<U+2019>s mandates is maximum employment. The unemployment rate is now at 4.9%. What would you consider to be maximum employment? How low might that number go? MR. TARULLO: Well, that<U+2019>s actually the point. I don<U+2019>t think we know in real time what the natural employment rate is right now. The unemployment rate has been around 5%, give or take, for over a year now, during which time we<U+2019>ve been creating at least twice<U+2014>and in some months three or more times<U+2014>as many jobs as are needed to deal with new entrants into the labor force without pushing up inflation. That suggested to me that there was a good bit of slack in the labor market, something I think in retrospect has proven to be true. Suppose in 2015 or even 2014 in anticipation of full employment at around 5%, we had taken several interest-rate moves. I think almost surely, we would have given up some of the benefits of that job creation, which has benefited those who didn<U+2019>t profit as much from the early part of the expansion. That includes lower-income workers, African-Americans, Hispanics and others that traditionally have higher unemployment rates. We would have lost something. So I think the real answer is we don<U+2019>t know. And that<U+2019>s why I<U+2019>ve taken the position we should proceed pragmatically, look at the data on inflation and look and see what<U+2019>s going on in labor markets. And then, at an appropriate moment, take the next step and then sit back and say, <U+201C>OK, what impact has that had?<U+201D> MR. KING: The new administration is talking about a sort of Republican version of stimulus that would include tax cuts, repatriation of corporate profits, some kind of burst in infrastructure spending and possibly other spending, without a huge amount of concern, at least in the short term, for the debt. How might that change the Fed<U+2019>s outlook? MR. TARULLO: Fiscal policy is one of the important background considerations in thinking about the appropriate monetary policy to achieve the dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. So we obviously are sensitive to the impact that fiscal policy has. But I want to emphasize, it is to the impact . It isn<U+2019>t to an expectation. Let<U+2019>s give the new administration time to actually get its program and for Congress to decide what it<U+2019>s going to do. And then the Fed will react appropriately to the impact of that in the economy. MR. KING: You voted for the rate increase last December. The anticipation now is that there will be one next month. To what extent can you outline what you see rate policy as being, not just in December but through next year? MR. TARULLO: Well, I can only speak for myself here, and I don<U+2019>t want to comment on any particular meeting. I think the important issue is actually the one that your question identifies, which is what is the policy? And as I said, I think the policy now ought to be one in which we respond to the incoming data. At this juncture, I think it<U+2019>s probably more likely that the next response would be a tightening rather than more accommodation. And then given the trajectory that we<U+2019>ve been on for some time now, I think at that juncture, we watch carefully to see what the impact of that presumed rate increase would be. Remember, monetary policy operates with a lag. MR. KING: There was a lot of talk about Dodd-Frank during the campaign. And there<U+2019>s now some presumption that the Republican majority will go after it in some fashion. Do you have concerns about it being dismantled? MR. TARULLO: Just like with fiscal policy, I don<U+2019>t want to speculate as to what may happen. Obviously, if changes are made, we will implement faithfully whatever changes the Congress makes.

After spending most of the year ducking and running for cover from one Trump utterance after another, not much has changed for Capitol Hill Republicans <U+2014> other than that they won election. They returned to Washington this week facing a barrage of questions about Steve Bannon, mass deportations and a lobbyist-packed Trump transition team, and many of them are dancing around the clear differences between Trump and the rank and file in the Capitol, like spending more on infrastructure and defense while also cutting the deficit. Story Continued Below Now, Republicans are holding out hope that his passage from candidate to leader of the free world will bring about the long-awaited Trump pivot. <U+201C>They<U+2019>re in a whirlwind over there right now,<U+201D> said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, when asked about Trump's transition team. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think we<U+2019>re going to have a clear picture of things for a few weeks. Maybe a month or two.\" <U+201C>It<U+2019>s one thing to be out on a campaign trail, it<U+2019>s another thing to be here. And then the reality of the issues that we have to deal with sink in,<U+201D> said one Republican senator, who nonetheless was enthusiastic about Republicans winning the White House and both chambers of Congress. <U+201C>Between right now and Jan. 20, things that are said should be taken more and more seriously.<U+201D> Presidential Transition By Eli Stokols For Republicans, dealing with Trump and his team of loyalists certainly beats trying to govern alongside Hillary Clinton. But at least they were prepared for that possibility. The reason for the challenging union between Trump and the Republican Congress? GOP lawmakers simply thought he would lose. <U+201C>We really hadn<U+2019>t thought [his election] was likely to happen. So we hadn<U+2019>t really thought about it much,<U+201D> said a second Republican senator. <U+201C>You don<U+2019>t have to be president on Nov. 9. You<U+2019>ve got about 10 weeks to really think about what this really means. Nobody but the guy who<U+2019>s elected president understands how sobering it is to figure out: You<U+2019>ve got the job.<U+201D> And if Trump's spontaneity and aggressive brand of politics become a fixture in Washington, it will have to mesh with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's methodical style, even as the Kentucky Republican's conference must be ready to react to the latest Trump developments. Things are no different in the House, where House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) repeatedly deflected uncomfortable questions about Trump during a news conference. Most troubling for Trump out of the gate is Sen. Rand Paul's (R-Ky.) vow to try and block the confirmation of John Bolton or Rudy Giuliani if either man is nominated for secretary of state. Unless Republicans can find a Democrat to support either of those picks, Paul could singlehandedly derail one or the other in a closely divided Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Presidential Transition By Michael Crowley and Shane Goldmacher Paul is also sending a broader message: That the president-elect will have to deal with the bloc of libertarian-leaning Republicans that may oppose him on foreign policy, government surveillance and civil liberties. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m open to trying to stop anyone from leading the Department of State who doesn<U+2019>t understand the history of the Middle East, doesn<U+2019>t understand the Iraq war was a mistake, doesn<U+2019>t understand regime change,<U+201D> Paul said in an interview, explaining his shot across the bow at Trump: <U+201C>My effort to insert myself in the public debate is not to oppose Donald Trump, it<U+2019>s to support what Donald Trump said in the campaign.<U+201D> Indeed, Trump<U+2019>s campaign style is running headlong into reality. The appointment of Bannon, his combative strategist, has put Republicans in a defensive crouch. They've been quick to praise Reince Priebus as chief of staff, while denying all knowledge of the Breitbart executive-turned-White House consigliere. At a photo-op with Senator-elect Todd Young (R-Ind.), McConnell had a Bannon question sprung on him. His answer: <U+201C>It<U+2019>s great to see you guys today.<U+201D> Young declined to discuss Bannon when he left McConnell<U+2019>s office. Privately, some Republicans on Capitol Hill aren<U+2019>t sure how long Bannon will serve in the position, but as long as he does they do not want to agitate someone who ran an insurgent website that often cast establishment Republicans as traitorous. Sen. Lindsey Graham has opposed Donald Trump but focused in a press conference Tuesday on the ways in which he wants to work with the president-elect. | Getty And others in the party suggested Breitbart's aggressive posture toward Republicans was aimed at boosting the website<U+2019>s traffic, not a reflection of how Bannon will run Trump<U+2019>s political tactics. <U+201C>There seem to be a lot of people that will talk in ways that get attention and get attention for their businesses,<U+201D> said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). <U+201C>Most of us recognize that there is a reasonableness to be expected in discussions with the executive branch.<U+201D> On policy, many Republicans have little idea of what's coming next. Several said they<U+2019>ve not heard from Trump or his transition team and are going off his public remarks, some studying his speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, last month that vowed to \"drain the swamp\" and others scrutinizing a <U+201C>60 Minutes<U+201D> interview in which he vowed to deport as many as 3 million people who are suspected criminals. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a vigorous proponent of immigration reform who opposed Trump, held a media availability with reporters on Tuesday afternoon that centered on ways to work with the president-elect: Infrastructure, cracking down on Chinese currency manipulation and confirming a conservative Supreme Court justice. <U+201C>The reason I didn<U+2019>t pick [immigration] is I don<U+2019>t know what he wants to do. I'll tell you what I won<U+2019>t do: I will not vote for a bill that quite frankly deports [and] treats a grandmother and a drug dealer the same,<U+201D> Graham said. White House By Nahal Toosi Trump also has appeared to soften his commitment to building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. He's done the same on quickly repealing all of Obamacare by committing to keeping protection for people with pre-existing conditions and for children to stay on their parents<U+2019> insurance until they are 26. But Republicans insisted they were prepared for a more nuanced approach from Trump after a campaign built on punchy declarations to build the wall and tear out Obamacare root and branch. <U+201C>A fence isn<U+2019>t a wall? That<U+2019>s just picky. And the same thing with Obamacare. Republicans, I think for the most part all of us said: Repeal and replace, but we also recognize the importance of pre-existing conditions and the coverage there. That<U+2019>s nothing new,<U+201D> said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.). If Republicans said they are excited about working with Trump on a conservative legislative agenda, they are willing to pop at least one of Trump<U+2019>s campaign trial balloons: Term limits. A central piece of Trump<U+2019>s plans to <U+201C>drain the swamp<U+201D> of Washington largesse, McConnell said last week it will <U+201C>not be on the agenda in the Senate.<U+201D> <U+201C>It<U+2019>s fine to have a conversation about that. I<U+2019>ve always found the best term limit is an election,<U+201D> Cornyn said. Katie Glueck contributed to this report. By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

The website has a history of promoting sensational and false claims, which significantly undermines its credibility as a reliable source of news.\n\nAuthor background: The news lacks a specific author, which raises concerns about the accountability and expertise of the individual behind the content. Without a clear authorship, it is challenging to verify the qualifications or intentions of the person responsible for the information, casting doubt on the reliability of the report.\n\nEvidence test: The news presents a highly speculative and unsubstantiated claim about the presence of Martian faces in an image from NASA's Curiosity Rover. The lack of concrete evidence, scientific analysis, or official confirmation from credible sources like NASA further discredits the authenticity of the report.\n\nLanguage style: The language used in the news text is sensational and lacks a professional or objective tone. The excessive use of exclamation marks, unsubstantiated claims, and grandiose statements like \"they have known for a very long time already that life exists on every planet and moon out there\" indicate a lack of factual basis and a tendency towards sensationalism.\n\nOther analysis: The overall content of the news, including references to conspiracy theories, unsupported claims about NASA, and the suggestion of a cover-up regarding life on other planets, aligns with the characteristics of fake news designed to mislead or deceive readers.

Macy<U+2019>s slogan makes a handy title for the new exhibit, <U+201C> Real American Places: Edward Weston & Leaves of Grass <U+201D> at The Huntington Art Collections in San Marino, Calif. On view through March 2017, it includes roughly half of the 49 photos chosen for the ill-fated edition. \n<U+201C>Weston never explicitly said he was going to illustrate Whitman,<U+201D> James Glisson, co-curator of the show with Jenny Watts, told Truthdig. <U+201C>He didn<U+2019>t tell Macy until very far into the project.<U+201D> \nThe 54-year-old Weston was coming off a crowning career achievement the same year, the publication of <U+201C> California and the West ,<U+201D> financed through a Guggenheim Fellowship<U+2014>the first awarded to a photographer. The book represented a departure for Weston, who until then was known primarily as a studio photographer. He had taken his first road trip, covering 23,000 miles with his lover of 10 years, Charis Wilson , 28 years his junior, who wrote the book<U+2019>s highly praised text and became his second wife along the way. \nBy May 1941, they were ready to do it again, loading up an eight-cylinder Ford dubbed Walt and setting off from Wildcat Hill, their sanctuary in Carmel, Calif. This journey would cover 20,000 miles through 24 states over eight months, with Macy shelling out for expenses up to $1,000 over six months, including printing and supplies. \nTheir first significant stop was Boulder, Colo., where Weston photographed the Boulder (now Hoover) Dam. At a subsequent stop in Port Arthur, Texas, he captured more than a dozen frames of silvery spherical oil tanks. <U+201C>California and the West<U+201D> had featured natural landscapes, but man-made objects now took over his frame. \nThe first progress report to reach Macy gave him a real fright. What did otherworldly globes in Texas have to do with Walt Whitman? In his original proposal, Macy requested that Weston <U+201C>illustrate every other line in Whitman<U+2019>s poetry,<U+201D> which, taken literally, would require thousands of photos to match even half the images in the text. <U+201C>I hope this is a job which you can tackle quickly,<U+201D> he added without irony. \n<U+201C>He<U+2019>s very controlling,<U+201D> said Watts, who pored through correspondence between the two. <U+201C>He comes in with very strong ideas of what he wants. He<U+2019>s not very good at communicating it to the artist. Then he gets very horrified when something comes back that<U+2019>s not what he had envisioned.<U+201D> \nAlthough Macy had run into creative differences with artist Henri Matisse while working on another masterpiece dense with illusion, James Joyce<U+2019>s <U+201C> Ulysses ,<U+201D> it would be presumptuous to blame the publisher for the disagreement with Weston. Matisse hadn<U+2019>t bothered to read the book, delivering drawings based on the Greek mythical character instead of Joyce<U+2019>s text, for a price of $5,000. In Weston<U+2019>s case, he <U+201C>didn<U+2019>t give a hoot about <U+2018>Leaves of Grass<U+2019><U+2014>he was having the time of his life,<U+201D> according to Wilson<U+2019>s 1998 memoir, <U+201C> Through Another Lens .<U+201D> \nWhitman is mentioned only five times in 230 pages of notes chronicling the journey. Weston explained himself this way: <U+201C>My plan for work on this commission was direct: I photographed anything and everything I saw which excited me. I could do no more. Since Whitman<U+2019>s poems cover all walks of life, and every high- and byway, I couldn<U+2019>t easily neglect him.<U+201D> \nThis gave him license to expand his parameters, photographing places and people he was seeing for the first time. Gone are the wide horizons of <U+201C>California and the West,<U+201D> replaced by works of man<U+2014>a Louisiana church, a bottle farm in Ohio, the Brooklyn Bridge. Each is captured as an item on a list, ordered so as to tell a story, which is similar to how Whitman commonly structured his verse: \n<U+201C>I believe a leaf of grass is no less than a journeywork of the stars, And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren, And the tree-toad is a chef-d<U+2019>ouvre for the highest <U+2026><U+201D> \n<U+201C>There<U+2019>s this idea of movement and journey, one by foot, the other by car, that acts as a temporal element to what they<U+2019>re doing,<U+201D> Glisson said, completing the parallels between Weston and Whitman.",

McCaskill Brianna Ehley Jack Shafer \n source: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-accept-election-230098 \n text: 'I<U+2019>m being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters,' the Republican nominee declares at an Ohio rally. By Nolan D. McCaskill 10/20/16 05:56 PM EDT Updated 10/20/16 05:56 PM EDT Donald Trump will accept the outcome on Nov. 8 <U+2014> <U+201C>if I win,<U+201D> the Republican presidential nominee declared Thursday, mocking critics who have scolded him for suggesting he may not concede the election to Hillary Clinton if he loses. Campaigning for the first time since the third and final presidential debate <U+2014> and in the aftermath of campaign manager Kellyanne Conway<U+2019>s sweeping effort to clean up his comment <U+2014> Trump teased a big announcement. Story Continued Below <U+201C>Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna make a major announcement today,<U+201D> he told supporters in Delaware County, Ohio. <U+201C>I would like to promise and pledge, to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election <U+2014> if I win,<U+201D> he proclaimed, pointing directly to his supporters as they cheered him on. According to a transcript of his remarks, though, Trump could have gone a different route with his rhetorical jab. <U+201C>I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that when the results come in on election night, I will accept <U+2014> without delay or hesitation <U+2014> the concession speech of Hillary Rodham Clinton,<U+201D> an alternate version of his transcript sent out to reporters said. Being the showman that he is, Trump leveraged the all-eyes-on-me moment to rag on his Republican critics, who expressed outrage at Trump<U+2019>s unsubstantiated claim that the election is rigged against him, as well as his admission during Wednesday night's debate in Las Vegas that he may break precedent and refuse to concede the election. Republican Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina immediately rebuked Trump on Wednesday night. And they were joined Thursday by Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, as well as Maine Gov. Paul LePage. McCain, who lost his 2008 White House bid to Barack Obama, cast a concession as <U+201C>the American way.<U+201D> By POLITICO Staff <U+201C> I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance,\" he said in a lengthy statement. <U+201C>A concession isn<U+2019>t just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader<U+2019>s first responsibility.<U+201D> The Obamas, both out on the trail campaigning for Clinton on Thursday, also scorched Trump. \"This is more than just the usual standard lie,\" the president told a rowdy crowd in Miami. \"Because when you suggest rigging or fraud without a shred of evidence, when last night, at the debate, Trump becomes the first major party nominee in American history to suggest that he will not concede despite losing the vote and then says today that he will accept the results if he wins <U+2014> that is not a joking matter.<U+201D> Michelle Obama followed suit, telling Clinton supporters in Phoenix that Trump is \"threatening the very idea of America itself.\" \"We cannot stand for that. You do not keep American democracy in suspense,\" a fired-up first lady said. Trump<U+2019>s campaign spent the bulk of Thursday morning stressing that the GOP nominee has reverence for America<U+2019>s democracy and that it<U+2019>s Clinton who has contempt for its principles. Outside of the debate setting Thursday, Trump expanded on his now-infamous comment to moderator Chris Wallace that he will say at the time whether he accepts the election results and will leave the country in suspense. He framed it as a logical conclusion, suggesting that if the results are close, he has a right to impugn the results, and, he argued, Clinton is so corrupt that he has no choice but to maintain that right. Trump also highlighted alleged revelations from the WikiLeaks trove of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta<U+2019>s hacked emails, maintaining that Podesta was exposed claiming that illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have a driver<U+2019>s license. Trump told his supporters, <U+201C>Don<U+2019>t be naive.<U+201D> And he referenced reports that the Democratic National Committee paid operatives to incite violence at his rallies. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign and the DNC disavowed the revelations, which were featured in a secret sting video by conservative activist James O<U+2019>Keefe. <U+201C>This is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition of peaceful, democratic elections. A campaign like Clinton<U+2019>s that will incite violence, is truly a campaign that will do anything to win,<U+201D> Trump said. <U+201C>And the candidate like Crooked Hillary Clinton, who will lie to Congress, lie to the FBI, destroy 33,000 emails, put her office up for sale and put our confidential information in the reach of our enemies is a candidate who is truly capable of anything, including voter fraud.<U+201D> Trump said interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile should resign for allegedly giving Clinton a heads-up on questions ahead of a CNN event and suggested that Clinton join her in resigning. <U+201C>Why shouldn<U+2019>t Hillary Clinton resign from the race? She was given <U+2014> think of it <U+2014> she was given these questions,<U+201D> Trump said. <U+201C>She used these questions, studied the questions, got the perfect answer for the questions and never said that she did something that was totally wrong and inappropriate, hence the name Crooked Hillary.<U+201D> <U+201C>Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt and dishonest person ever to seek the office of the presidency,<U+201D> he continued. <U+201C>So it<U+2019>s in that context that I was asked a question about whether I would agree, in advance, to concede the results on election night, if for some reason we should lose, which <U+2014> we<U+2019>re not going to lose. And that was sort of an unprecedented question.<U+201D> By Brianna Ehley Like his allies, Trump pointed to the 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, remarking that if either candidate had agreed to concede at this point 16 years ago, they would have forfeited their right to challenge the results or call for a recount, though, given the circumstances, it<U+2019>s unlikely either candidate would have received blowback. The Bush v. Gore Supreme Court case, he noted, would cease to exist. <U+201C>In effect, I<U+2019>m being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters,<U+201D> he said. Trump said the subject of voter fraud came up during Wednesday<U+2019>s debate and stressed that he only wants a fair election. <U+201C>This is having nothing to do with me but having to do with the future of our country,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We have to have fairness.<U+201D> He continued suggesting deceased voters who are still on the rolls could influence the race if fraud is involved. <U+201C>You understand where I<U+2019>m coming from, right?<U+201D> Trump asked his supporters. Ultimately, though, Trump conceded that he would accept the results <U+2014> but without waiving his rights to challenge <U+201C>a questionable result.<U+201D> <U+201C>America is a constitutional republic with a system of laws. These laws are triggered in the case of fraud or in the event of a recount, where it<U+2019>s needed,<U+201D> Trump said. <U+201C>Of course, I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result, right? And always, I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all of the many candidates who have come before me. Always.<U+201D> Trump hailed his debate performance <U+2014> <U+201C>Seriously, the debate last night was amazing, and everybody said I won, including every single online poll<U+201D> <U+2014> but maintained that the bottom line is he will be victorious on Election Day. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re gonna win. We<U+2019>re gonna win,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re gonna win so badly. We<U+2019>re gonna win so badly.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/chelsea-clinton-being-groomed-to-buy.html While some pundits are declaring the Clinton political dynasty dead, sources tell us that it is far from over. Chelsea Clinton is being groomed for the New York seat held by Rep. Nita Lowey. Chelsea Clinton could run for the seat in NYC<U+2019>s 17th Congressional District once Lowey, a respected, 79-year-old career politician with nearly 30 years in office, decides to retire, we have exclusively learned. Lowey<U+2019>s district includes parts of Rockland and Westchester counties and, conveniently, Chappaqua, the Clinton family home base. Continuing the Clinton Crime Brand If you thought for one, fleeting second that the Clintons would just somehow walk away after Crooked Hillary<U+2019>s rejection by the American people, think again. There are many more billions to be made, and many more state favors to sell and trade. So the baton gets passed to Chelsea. Congresswoman Chelsea Clinton. Thanks for the Congressional seat, mom and dad! In August, Hillary and Bill Clinton purchased a home next door to their primary residence in Chappaqua for $1.16 million, which is intended for Chelsea, her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, and their two children, Charlotte and Aidan. While Chelsea currently lives, and is registered to vote, in Manhattan, she could easily make Chappaqua her legal residence in order to run for Lowey<U+2019>s seat when it becomes vacant. A source told us: <U+201C>While it is true the Clintons need some time to regroup after Hillary<U+2019>s crushing loss, they will not give up. Chelsea would be the next extension of the Clinton brand. <U+201C>In the past few years, she has taken a very visible role in the Clinton Foundation and on the campaign trail. <U+201C>While politics isn<U+2019>t the life Hillary wanted for Chelsea, she chose to go on the campaign trail for her mother and has turned out to be very poised, articulate and comfortable with the visibility.<U+201D> The source continued: <U+201C>There has been a lot of speculation within New York Democratic circles about Lowey<U+2019>s retirement and Chelsea running for the seat. There is a belief that Chappaqua is a logical place for Chelsea to run, because it would be straightforward for her to raise money and build a powerful base.<U+201D> A spokesperson for Lowey <U+2014> who is serving her 14th term in Congress and was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1988 <U+2014> declined to comment.

That is the best case scenario for us to all move forward,\" said Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.). | Getty By Rachael Bade and Jake Sherman 11/09/16 02:58 AM EST Updated 11/09/16 03:16 AM EST JANESVILLE, Wis. <U+2014> Donald Trump is about to be the next president. And one of the biggest questions Washington will wake up to Wednesday is this: Will Paul Ryan keep his job? The party's long-time golden boy staked out a position as the anti-Donald Trump. He rolled out his \"Better Way\" policy agenda, a vision of conservatism at odds with Trump on substance and style. Ryan spoke out when the brash New York billionaire-turned-president elect repeatedly sparked outrage with his words. And finally, a month before the election, Ryan told his 246 House Republican colleagues that he wouldn't defend or respond to Trump. Story Continued Below The question of whether the two men can co-exist with that fraught history will preoccupy the Republican Party and the House GOP majority in the coming days and weeks. Will Trump and his allies in conservative media sphere train their venom on the Wisconsin Republican and try to push him out? And more broadly, how much damage does Trump's win do to Ryan's career? It's clear what some of Trump's more anti-establishment allies think. Sean Hannity, the Fox News host and confidante of Trump, said it plainly Tuesday night: \"Paul Ryan is not going to be speaker of the House in January.\" But Hannity is a television host who doesn't have a vote in the House of Representatives. He could rally Republicans against Ryan <U+2014> and Trump could try to push the speaker out. But, at least in the immediate aftermath of the election, there seemed to be little appetite for that within the GOP conference. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t believe for a second there will be any hard feelings, either way. Mr. Trump is not the kind of person who would look for revenge,<U+201D> said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), an early Trump supporter who is also friendly with Ryan. <U+201C>For awhile Mr. Trump seemed aggravated [that Ryan distanced himself from the nominee], but it<U+2019>s amazing how winning soothes those kinds of feelings, and he won. And Mr. Ryan did support him and did vote for him.<U+201D> He added: <U+201C>We<U+2019>re all going to be driving down the same road, and I totally don<U+2019>t expect any issues whatsoever [with] Ryan continuing as speaker, or any animosity between he and Mr. Trump.<U+201D> Not everyone is so confident in Trump<U+2019>s willingness to move on. As a top staffer to one of Trump<U+2019>s most vocal Hill surrogates put it, <U+201C>It depends on whether we get magnanimous Trump or a vengeful Trump <U+2014> could go either way.<U+201D> A senior House Republican who did not wish to be named also argued that Trump could <U+201C>have a lot of influence over what happens<U+201D> in a speakership election because <U+201C>there are many Republican districts in the House where he will have won with 70 percent.<U+201D> <U+201C>He would be the president-elect. If he chose to engage [in the speakerhip decision], it would matter... either way,<U+201D> the lawmaker said on condition on anonymity. There were signs Ryan's speakership was imperiled before Trump's victory. In some corners of the House Republican Conference, there was talk of challenging Ryan. By the margins alone, Ryan should be able to reclaim the speakership. But, at this point, it seems certain he'll need Trump's boosting. \"Trump should say he wants Ryan as speaker. That is the best case scenario for us to all move forward,\" said Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.), who won his fifth term Tuesday night. \"We have to end the Republican civil war and Trump can do that.\" By Kenneth P. Vogel and Alex Isenstadt Ryan in recent days has inched closer to Trump. He announced he voted for Trump last week, said he was willing to campaign with him over the weekend and wrote an op-ed in CNN encouraging Republicans to back the nominee. On Tuesday night, the speaker called Trump and his running mate Mike Pence to congratulate them on their victory. Pence, the vice president-elect, has been supportive of Ryan in the past and could soon become his greatest advocate. The pair have been friends for years <U+2014> since Pence<U+2019>s days serving in the House. Ryan introduced him at the Republican National Convention, and they campaigned together in Wisconsin. In a written statement early Wednesday morning, Ryan said Trump's win \"marks a repudiation of the status quo of failed liberal progressive policies. We are eager to work hand-in-hand with the new administration to advance an agenda to improve the lives of the American people. This has been a great night for our party, and now we must turn our focus to bringing the country together.\" Keeping Ryan around could offer some advantages for the president-elect. Trump has shown little interest in policy but will need to soon; he could potentially lean on Ryan to advance his agenda. Ryan also led the effort to keep the House majority, a huge success by any measure. His fundraising prowess could continue to boost Republicans. And as much as Ryan rankled Trump during the election, the speaker is still popular on Capitol Hill. If Trump is serious about ending the Republican civil war, making peace with Ryan could be a first step. \"If [Trump] is President, why would he want to start by tearing the party in half? He would instantly alienate half of the House Republicans,<U+201D> said a senior GOP source. <U+201C>Paul is the best thing for Trump. He can bring the rank-and-file establishment to the table for Trump. If Trump takes Paul out he will have big trouble moving anything.<U+201D> By Michael Grunwald By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Bret Stephens \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-neo-nationalists-1479774129 \n text: <U+201C>I<U+2019>m an economic nationalist. I am an America first guy. And I have admired nationalist movements throughout the world, have said repeatedly strong nations make great neighbors. I<U+2019>ve also said repeatedly that the ethno-nationalist movement, prominent in Europe, will change over time. I<U+2019>ve never been a supporter of ethno-nationalism.<U+201D> So said Stephen K. Bannon, Donald Trump <U+2019>s chief strategist, in a wide-ranging interview with my colleague Kimberley Strassel published in these pages on Saturday. Later in the interview Mr. Bannon inveighed against <U+201C>the policies of globalism,<U+201D> which, he said, had <U+201C>severely hurt<U+201D> the interests of America<U+2019>s working and middle classes of every race. Over the weekend, several friends told me they found the interview reassuring about Mr. Bannon. I found it chilling. Start with economic nationalism, a shopworn idea commonly associated with Latin American governments such as Juan Per<U+00F3>n<U+2019>s Argentina. In its milder form, economic nationalism means state subsidies for national-champion companies, giant infrastructure projects, targeted tariff protections for politically favored industries, <U+201C>Buy American<U+201D> provisions in government contracting, federal interventions against foreign takeovers of <U+201C>sensitive<U+201D> companies. The U.S. already does much of this on a bipartisan basis, so let<U+2019>s assume that Mr. Bannon<U+2019>s notion of <U+201C>economic nationalism<U+201D> doesn<U+2019>t end by demanding that federal workers drive American cars. What else might it mean? In France, it has meant bailouts for failing industrial giants like Alstom . In Japan, it has meant 800% tariffs on imported rice, decades of blowout spending on airports, roads and bridges, and chronic hostility to immigration. Russia passed more protectionist measures in 2013 than any other country, according to the Moscow Times. What do these and other countries that practice variants of economic nationalism have in common? France, where the state accounts for 57% of the economy, hasn<U+2019>t seen annual GDP growth top 3% since the turn of the millennium. Japan, which has the world<U+2019>s oldest population along with the highest debt-to-GDP ratio, experienced no fewer than five recessions between 2008 and 2015. Russia<U+2019>s GDP contracted by 40% between 2013 and 2015. Its economy is now half the size of Great Britain<U+2019>s. Economic nationalism, in other words, means economic ruin<U+2014>along with all the political favoritism, crony capitalism and inefficiency that Americans usually associate with Solyndra, the Synfuels Corp., or the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Mr. Bannon wants to double down on this winning formula. Mr. Bannon also says he<U+2019>s <U+201C>America first,<U+201D> which<U+2014>see if you can spot the difference<U+2014>either is or isn<U+2019>t <U+201C>America First.<U+201D> Either way, the animating impulse behind <U+201C>America first<U+201D> is that there are some Americans who put their country second, or last, presumably behind their ethnic loyalties, ideological affinities or economic interests. America first isn<U+2019>t a policy program or a political motto so much as it is an accusation of disloyalty. What real American, after all, wouldn<U+2019>t put <U+201C>America first<U+201D> in his political priorities? Mr. Bannon<U+2019>s answer, along with that of the alt-right movement he has proudly championed through his Breitbart website, is <U+201C>the globalists.<U+201D> The globalists are supposed to be the bankers at Goldman Sachs who paid Mrs. Clinton her handsome speaking fees. They are editorial writers at this newspaper, who champion the virtues of free trade and a liberal immigration policy. They are the <U+201C>warmongers<U+201D> demanding sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine. But the truth is that Wall Street bankers, recently naturalized immigrants and even mainstream journalists have as much right to advocate a view of the American interest as Mr. Bannon and his fellow travelers. That<U+2019>s the American way, which disavows traditional concepts of nationalism in favor of a broader ideal of citizenship<U+2014>identity defined primarily by participation and aspiration, not ancestry. Nationalism may be a fine idea for Japan or Iceland. America is exceptional because it<U+2019>s built on a different premise. As for Mr. Bannon<U+2019>s admiration for nationalist movements, that might explain the odd way in which Breitbart has deployed anti-Semitic tropes to denounce <U+201C>globalist<U+201D> Jewish writers such as the Washington Post<U+2019>s Anne Applebaum while being stalwart in its support for Israel. Whatever the case, the distinction between nationalism and ethno-nationalism is a slippery one. As my colleague Bari Weiss pointed out in a recent article in Tablet, the foremost figure of today<U+2019>s alt-right, Richard Spencer, dreams of <U+201C>a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans. It would be a new society based on very different ideals than, say, the Declaration of Independence.<U+201D> Mr. Spencer<U+2019>s vision may not be Mr. Bannon<U+2019>s. But the newfound political power of the latter will inevitably open channels for the former. In <U+201C>The Second Coming,<U+201D> Yeats asked, <U+201C>What rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?<U+201D> The answer, it may yet turn out, is the likes of Steve Bannon and his ugly litter of neo-nationalists.

However, things didn<U+2019>t go so well for Hillary Clinton, who was humiliated when a camera caught what she immediately tried to hide to save her campaign <U+2014> which backfired big time. \nWhile Donald Trump<U+2019>s 15,000-person army of <U+201C>Deplorables<U+201D> were holding down the fort in Stanford, Florida as they listened to this great leader explain how he plans to make America great again, Hillary was at a much smaller venue at Palm Beach State College. Although she was feeling pretty good about herself with having a higher turnout than she<U+2019>s used to, the approximate 1,000 to 2,000 attendees paled in comparison to what Trump was looking at in the same state. However, Hillary<U+2019>s anemic crowd was enough to be publicly mocked in front of. \nPerhaps Hillary didn<U+2019>t think anyone would notice, but Fox Business Network was watching <U+2014> and commenting <U+2014> live. With just fifteen minutes before the Democratic candidate was set to take the stage in one of her final and most important rallies, the small room should have been jam-packed with people. As the humored hosts noted on the news show, that was far from the case. \n<U+201C>Here it is nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in Sanford, Florida yesterday for Mr. Trump, 15,000. There<U+2019>s maybe a thousand to two thousand people here today,<U+201D> one host pointed out much to Hillary<U+2019>s embarrassment. <U+201C>The Clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see there<U+2019>s empty space here and she<U+2019>s supposed to speak in 15 minutes. And I can tell you that as the camera pans across that if we were at a Trump rally this would absolutely be packed,<U+201D> the commentators added. \nNo matter how far ahead in the polls Hillary and her lapdog media says she is, the attendance at her events speaks volumes. Nobody cares or is enthusiastic enough about this woman to bother showing up, and those who do have to be coached on how to chant and act excited. \nOn the other hand, there are Trump<U+2019>s rallies, where so many people turn up to venues four times the size as Hillary<U+2019>s that these massive stadiums can<U+2019>t contain everyone who is eager to come, and some are turned away. If the turnout at the rallies is any indicator of what<U+2019>s expected at the polls, Hillary can<U+2019>t win, and if she does, Americans should definitely question how that could even happen",

Rather than continue to share the ad revenue with publishers, the social media company said it would rather pay content partners a flat license fee up front and pocket all the ad dollars , Recode reports. The move offers publishers a steady revenue stream for investing in creating Snapchat content, but essentially caps the amount of money they can make on the app. For Snapchat, the new arrangement would mean full control over its ad inventory. Snapchat is also looking to extend the financial terms to companies in talks to create content for its new short-form video offering called <U+201C>Snapchat Shows.<U+201D> Still, the benefit for publishers, beyond getting their own brand in front of millions of users, would become a licensing fee, not ad revenue. ALL IN THE FAMILY: The New York Times named 36-year-old Arthur Gregg <U+201C>A.G.<U+201D> Sulzberger as deputy publisher , positioning him to succeed his father as publisher and chairman of the company. He was one of three cousins in the running to become heir apparent. If he<U+2019>s eventually elevated to publisher, he would be the fifth generation of the family to serve in that role. Mr. Sulzberger had led the team that drafted the paper<U+2019>s 2014 <U+201C>innovation report<U+201D> and since July 2015 he has been associate editor for strategy, helping to lead the newsroom<U+2019>s continued digital transformation. As the New York Times reports, his elevation comes at a time of anxiety in the newsroom with a downsizing expected next year as the industry overall struggles to replace plunging print ad sales with digital and mobile revenue. Dow Jones & Co., which includes The Wall Street Journal, has similarly been struggling with a volatile ad market. As WSJ reports, Dow Jones told union representatives this week that its plans to restructure its operations. That could include a possible reduction in head count across Dow Jones, as the company also considers other cost-reduction options such as combining or eliminating sections, according to people familiar with the matter. ELECTION CLOUDS: Before the end of the year, marketers tend to dig into their couches to find dollars they didn<U+2019>t realize they had<U+2014>an annual habit that makes it tough for their ad agencies to predict just how much last-minute project business they<U+2019>ll be able to drum up. This year, that kind of unpredictability, met with a presidential election unlike any other, is creating even more uncertainty for agencies that live and die by client business. Omnicom CEO John Wren said during the company<U+2019>s third-quarter earnings call that a <U+201C>very unusual year with the presidential election<U+201D> is adding to a <U+201C>general conservatism,<U+201D> making the outlook for this quarter murky, reports CMO Today. The election itself also provided less business for the group in the third quarter compared with past elections since Republicans aren<U+2019>t spending as much as Democrats, said Mr. Wren. The Republican National Committee hasn't spent a penny on commercials to get Trump elected , reports Politico. The Trump campaign only recently committed to ad spending, having relied on the candidate<U+2019>s media prowess. MACHINE MADNESS: What do you do when you don<U+2019>t have enough reporters to cover the news event of the year? If you<U+2019>re the Washington Post trying to cover nearly 500 contests on Election Day, the strategy is homegrown artificial intelligence, reports CMO Today. The Post is looking to automate some of its news coverage with a data-crunching program called Heliograf , which will be able to automatically update some stories, even adding some analysis. The idea is to bolster the Post<U+2019>s team of 60 political reporters as the paper attempts to cover every House, Senate and gubernatorial race in the country. The Post first experimented with Heliograf to cover events at the Summer Olympics, but it isn<U+2019>t the first news outlet to try its hand at automated journalism. The AP in 2014 began using automated technology to produce some earnings stories. And financial news startup Money.net, which has been building a lower-cost version of Bloomberg terminals, just tapped Bloomberg and Time Inc. vet Norman Pearlstine to build an automated news service . Millions will be tuning in for Wednesday night<U+2019>s debate as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton face off for a third and final time before the election. Fox News anchor Chris Wallace will mark the network<U+2019>s first journalist to moderate such a general election showdown. [ NYT ] Sony, Facebook and Google are among the companies that have placed their bets on virtual reality, but marketers have been slower to jump into the fray. Still, brands like Pepsi and Toyota said at this week<U+2019>s Virtual Reality 2020 Summit that they know they need to start experimenting with the format. [ CMO Today ] Disney may have pulled out of its bid for buy Twitter due to concerns that bullying and other untoward communication on the site could tarnish its wholesome family image. Meanwhile, it turns out that Salesforce, which also recently dropped out of the running for Twitter, didn<U+2019>t even have the social giant on its original list of possible acquisition targets only months earlier. [ Bloomberg , WSJ ] Yahoo reported a slight rise in usage of its email product since disclosing a massive data breach. But while earnings and its fourth-quarter outlook topped expectations, Yahoo still has a core advertising business that continues to deteriorate ahead of the closing of its sale to Verizon. [ WSJ ] The Daily News has appointed editorial veteran Arthur Browne as its new editor in chief a year after tapping Jim Rich for the role. [ Politico ] Comedian Harry Shearer alleges he was slighted out of years of profits from <U+201C>This Is Spinal Tap,<U+201D> the cult classic he helped create and starred in. He filed a lawsuit seeking $125 million in damages from Vivendi, which controls the film<U+2019>s rights, and its subsidiary. [ WSJ ] Google updated its survey product, which now allows marketers and publishers to target surveys to specific groups of users who have previously been exposed to certain content or taken specific actions.

        "input": "time: null \n author: WakingTimes \n source: wakingtimes.com \n text: Waking Times \nYou can only get so far with orders, and the misuse of power. The same goes with the restriction of human action. The war on drugs has been an abject failure , as has been the American <U+2018>democracy.<U+2019> It is the same with a corporatized prison system, and so too, will be the attempted overtaking of the American people by a corrupt cabal. If the 2016 elections have taught us nothing else, it is that we should be very careful who we make into our political martyrs. \nDespots and tyrants can rule effectively for a time, but in the end, they always perish <U+2013> their civilizations and accomplishments with them. The fall of Rome ring any bells? It doesn<U+2019>t matter if you voted for Hillary Clinton with her ties to the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, or for Trump who has alienated women, minorities, gays, and educated leftists alike with his misogynistic comments, and brash unpredictable actions. This election is a call to find our inner hero . We need her/him, as never before. \nThis election has caused monumental stress because it has exposed our deep, perhaps subconscious desire to shirk responsibility and off-load it onto a public figure. We want an external hero. What happens when someone truly leads , is a different, and positively inspiring story altogether. 1.) What a Leader Isn<U+2019>t \n<U+201C>When we quit thinking primarily about ourselves and our own self-preservation, we undergo a truly heroic transformation of consciousness.<U+201D> ~ Joseph Campbell \nA true hero, or heroin <U+2014> the quintessential leader of our time is not a politician. The etymology of the word leader comes from the root word <U+2018>lead<U+2019>, which means, to guide and inspire. The word hero is derived from both Greek and Latin words meaning to watch over and to protect. It doesn<U+2019>t mean to lord over. It has nothing to do with warnings and chastisements, nor the use of force, either legislatively, financially, socially, or politically to get people to do what you want them to do. \nA true leader doesn<U+2019>t divide and conquer. They gather masses without trying in a unified cause by being in service, by acting, as Anthony Robbins once said, <U+2018>as a slave<U+2019> to a purpose higher than protecting themselves. This could be family. It could be community. A leader might inspire a few, or several thousand but their work endures, even after they perish because its intent was pure. \nMany leaders are quiet. Others are bold, but they are never self-serving. A tell-tale sign of a true leader, is one who needs no <U+2018>credit<U+2019> for what they have given to society, and who simply thrives on the action of their own internally driven inspiration. They don<U+2019>t check the poles and they don<U+2019>t need your <U+2018>vote.<U+2019> As Lao Tzu has said, <U+201C>A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.<U+201D> \nHitler wasn<U+2019>t a true leader, nor was Stalin. Their rise to fame and power was brief. Add to that list, George Soros, Bill Gates, The Clinton<U+2019>s, the Trumps, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, et al. \nInstead, look to individuals like Edward Leedskalnin , the Latvian emigrant who built one of the most impressive structures on the planet, not for fame, but to honor a lost love. People still can<U+2019>t surmise how coral castle was created. Look to Nikola Tesla whose work is used in every conceivable manner still today (some of his inventions known and others still hidden by those who seek false power.) \nAs another true leader, R. Buckminster Fuller would say , <U+201C> You never change things by fighting existing reality . To change something you create a new model which makes the old one obsolete.<U+201D> \nThe self-appointed <U+2018>leaders<U+2019> of our time fight against the masses. They fight against Mother Nature , and they torment themselves trying to accumulate more power to wield over the world. What could they be reflecting in us is the question we should really be asking. 2.) A True Leader Often Won<U+2019>t Fit in with <U+2018>Regular<U+2019> Society \n<U+201C>Men do not accept their prophets and slay them, but they love their martyrs and worship those whom they have tortured to death.<U+201D> ~ Fyodor Dostoevsky \nBetween the years 325 and 787 A.D., many people were treated poorly by society at large because of the different conflicts that were going on. One of the main conflicts in this era surrounded religion. If you were not like the Roman Catholics, and decided to believe in freedom of religion, you were <U+201C>excluded<U+201D> from the Roman Catholic Church and thereby, society. Those seeking religious freedom were deemed sinners, and lawless hooligans. \nThis is just one of many incidents in history that we can look back on and observe that the societal conscience always changes. It isn<U+2019>t absolute. A leader is never swayed by the <U+2018>popular<U+2019> or the <U+2018>common.<U+2019> They think only about what is best for society in that time and space. \nThere have been numerous outcasts of various degree who were true leaders. Malcolm X, Bob Marley, Indira Gandhi, Hatshepsut, Aung San Suu Kyi, etc. 3.) A True Leader Can<U+2019>t Solve All of Your Problems \nNumber three is a big one. A true leader will never solve all your problems, and they don<U+2019>t even try. Their sole purpose is to help you find the strength to display heroic acts of your own. They inspire. They exemplify, but they realize that by solving your problems they would actually be taking away your opportunity to learn, and grow. You<U+2019>ve earned whatever lessons you currently face, but you will also receive the gifts hidden in a challenge, only when you take full responsibility and face your shadowed projections. \nThe wicked will shout for you to change your ways. The divine will whisper, and wait for you to heed the encouragement of grace. 4.) A True Leader Will Never Ask You to Follow Them \nSaints and yogis are notorious for sending aspiring followers away. They<U+2019>ll ignore them, cajole, them, and even ridicule their seemingly fervent desire to learn from a master. That<U+2019>s because they want you to do your work first. If you are expecting some miraculous cure or salvation from anyone, even a saint, you<U+2019>ll be waiting a good long while. This doesn<U+2019>t mean that divine intervention doesn<U+2019>t happen, or that we shouldn<U+2019>t look to others for help or advice, but ultimately, a leader shows the way simply by doing his own work. The one thing we can learn from this example is to do ours, too. \nA final note <U+2014> A true leader is <U+2018>God<U+2019> in action. As Joseph Campbell has said, <U+201C>What is a god? A god is a personification of a motivating power of a value system that functions in human life and in the universe.<U+201D> No credentials or filibusters needed.

        "input": "time: null \n author: MARK SCHMITT \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/opinion/identity-over-ideology.html?_r=0 \n text: The election of Donald J. Trump will bring as sharp a turn to the right as this country has seen since at least the election of Ronald Reagan <U+2014> thanks mainly to the rare conservative control of Congress, the presidency and, before long, the Supreme Court. But in a strange and unforeseeable way his campaign and election mark the end of the era in which American politics is defined by ideological conflict. Ever since the election of Reagan 36 years ago, American politics has been marked by profound ideological division, increasing polarization and often paralysis. The ideologically coherent and often unyielding conservative movement represented the dominant theme, while liberals (many of whom wouldn<U+2019>t even use that word) struggled to find a pitch as clear and appealing as the right<U+2019>s message of lower taxes, smaller government and strong defense. The election of 2016 is the culmination of this ideological era, but ironically reveals its hollowness. The politics of 2016 breaks entirely along lines of identity: first race or ethnicity, followed by gender, level of education, urbanization and age. The first mystery of the year was how Donald Trump won his party<U+2019>s nomination, but more important, why 16 others, including popular governors and senators, lost. The answer is simply that all the others thought the key to the Republican base was ideology. Some, such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, styled themselves as the purest and most adamant of conservatives, others as just practical enough to deliver on conservative goals and one (Gov. John Kasich) as sort of a moderate. None of them clicked with the Republican base, simply because ideology wasn<U+2019>t what motivated the base. It was always about identity, about them and us. Only Mr. Trump had that key. Consider immigration, the concept that drove both the Tea Party and the Trump campaign. For most of the long campaign, the media thought that it was about immigration policy : comprehensive immigration reform versus border security and deportations. The Republican <U+201C>autopsy<U+201D> from 2012 concluded that Republicans should support immigration reform. But it turns out it was always just about immigrants , as in, people who aren<U+2019>t like us, not policy. That<U+2019>s why Trump supporters were unmoved by reports that Melania Trump had worked in the United States without authorization, and it<U+2019>s why Mr. Trump, in a late rally in Minnesota, declared that the state had <U+201C> suffered enough <U+201D> from the presence of Somali immigrants, a well-settled middle-class group in the state for more than two decades. It<U+2019>s why Mr. Trump found his strongest support not in areas most affected by immigration but in aging states with the lowest number of foreign-born residents, such as Ohio, Iowa and Wisconsin, where immigration is mostly a distant symbol of otherness. Ideology had formed a kind of a comforting curtain around the more intractable divides of race and identity. Ideological conflict, as deep and irresolvable as it often seems, at least in theory, lends itself to persuasion and compromise, such as President Obama<U+2019>s long quest for a <U+201C>grand bargain<U+201D> on spending and taxes. Ideology can help structure people<U+2019>s engagement with politics, giving them clear preferences organized around a few core values. But ideology can also be hard work <U+2014> most people don<U+2019>t have the time or inclination to decide if they are <U+201C>liberal<U+201D> or <U+201C>conservative,<U+201D> and what that means, or to fight about it. With his shifting, largely irrelevant policies, his birtherism and his targeting of people (Mexicans, <U+201C>bad hombres<U+201D>) rather than problems, Mr. Trump pulled the curtain away. It was identity all along. Mr. Cruz, Paul D. Ryan and, in the 1990s, Newt Gingrich hadn<U+2019>t mobilized their constituencies into an ideological army, it turned out; they had simply pushed identity politics further to the forefront in white America. (It became overt when Senator John McCain<U+2019>s first ad in the 2008 general election declared him <U+201C>t he American president Americans have been waiting for ,<U+201D> and continued with the identitarian, anti-immigrant fervor of the Tea Party.) Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s campaign was identity-focused as well, in the more traditional sense, defining the country as a happy cosmopolitan polyglot, and according to some reporting, it deliberately expended resources on college-educated women, young voters and minorities (the <U+201C> Rising American Electorate<U+201D>) rather than noncollege white working-class voters. If so, it was a tactical mistake. Mr. Obama in 2012 had targeted the same voters, but with a more explicitly ideological story about government<U+2019>s role in rebuilding the auto industry and the economy. What<U+2019>s the alternative to ideological or identity politics? Before Reagan, politics had been largely technocratic, substituting expertise for ideology. <U+201C>What is at stake in our economic decisions today is not some grand warfare of rival ideologies which will sweep the country with passion but the practical management of a modern economy,<U+201D> John F. Kennedy said in 1962. Experts would address <U+201C>subtle challenges for which technical answers, not political answers, must be provided.<U+201D> The candidacy of Barry Goldwater two years later and Reagan 18 years later, along with the <U+201C>Best and the Brightest<U+201D> debacle in Vietnam, proved the fallacy of that technocratic era. One of the odd things about Mr. Trump is that he has brought back J.F.K.<U+2019>s <U+201C>trust me<U+201D> mode in a kind of unhinged parody. His plans are neither detailed nor ideological: He will replace the Affordable Care Act with <U+201C>great plans<U+201D> and negotiate better deals. A reporter listening to an early focus group of Trump supporters in 2015 said they <U+201C>sounded like relations of an ill patient, furious that all the previous doctors have botched a test or fumbled the scalpel. To them, Trump actually is the real-deal fixer-upper, and he is going to make America great again.<U+201D> Rather than a pragmatic fixer-upper, Mr. Trump now seems likely to be the vehicle through which the ideological right achieves its decades-old dream of undoing the Great Society and the Warren and Burger courts. But the victory that made that possible was based explicitly on identity, not ideology. Mark Schmitt is the director of the political reform program at the research organization New America.",

NO-GO Zones are violent and lawless Muslim migrant dominated neighborhoods around Paris that are virtually off limits to non-Muslims and a threat to police and firefighters. Gatestone (h/t Brenda K) There is a mountain of evidence that confirms the existence of Muslim <U+2018>NO GO ZONES<U+2019> (Zones Urbaines Sensibles) where non-Muslims are afraid to go because they regularly are attacked by gangs of Muslims who rule these lawless neighborhoods. Host-country authorities have effectively lost control over many no-go zones and are often unable or unwilling to provide even basic public aid, such as police, fire fighting and ambulance services, out of fear of being attacked by Muslim youth. Muslim enclaves in European cities are also breeding grounds for Islamic radicalism and pose a significant threat to Western security. Europe<U+2019>s no-go zones are the by-product of decades of multicultural policies that have encouraged Muslim immigrants to create parallel societies and remain segregated from <U+2014> rather than become integrated into <U+2014> their European host nations. A 120-page research paper entitled <U+201C>No-Go Zones in the French Republic: Myth or Reality?<U+201D> documented dozens of French neighborhoods <U+201C>where police and gendarmerie cannot enforce the Republican order or even enter without risking confrontation, projectiles, or even fatal shootings.<U+201D> A landmark 2,200-page report, <U+201C>Banlieue de la R<U+00E9>publique<U+201D> (Suburbs of the Republic) found that Seine-Saint-Denis and other Parisian suburbs are becoming <U+201C>separate Islamic societies<U+201D> cut off from the French state, and where Islamic Sharia law is rapidly displacing French civil law. The report said that Muslim immigrants are increasingly rejecting French values and instead are immersing themselves in literal violent Islam. The problem of no-go zones is well documented, but multiculturalists and their politically correct supporters vehemently deny that they exist. Some are now engaged in a concerted campaign to discredit and even silence those who draw attention to the issue. A 120-page research paper entitled <U+201C>No-Go Zones in the French Republic: Myth or Reality?<U+201D> documented dozens of French neighborhoods <U+201C>where police and gendarmerie cannot enforce the Republican order or even enter without risking confrontation, projectiles, or even fatal shootings.<U+201D> In October 2011, a 2,200-page report, <U+201C>Banlieue de la R<U+00E9>publique<U+201D> (Suburbs of the Republic) found that Seine-Saint-Denis and other Parisian suburbs are becoming <U+201C>separate Islamic societies<U+201D> cut off from the French state and where Islamic Sharia law is rapidly displacing French civil law. The report also showed how the problem is being exacerbated by radical Muslim preachers who are promoting the social marginalization of Muslim immigrants in order to create a parallel Muslim society in France that is ruled by Sharia law. The television presenter asks: <U+201C>What if we went to the suburbs?<U+201D> Obertone replies: <U+201C>I do not recommend this. Not even we French dare go there anymore. But nobody talks about this in public, of course. Nor do those who claim, <U+2018>long live multiculturalism,<U+2019> and <U+2018>Paris is wonderful!<U+2019> dare enter the suburbs.<U+201D> Back in 2015, the Mayor of Paris threatened to sue FOX News for reporting on the problem of Muslim NO-GO Zones. As a result, several FOX commentators were forced to issue apologies on the air for claiming after the Charlie Hebdo attack that there are Muslim-ruled <U+201C>no-go zones<U+201D> in France. \nc",

Ms. Ingram, who backed Hillary Clinton, told her husband, a Donald Trump supporter, that the comments he made about evil emanating from anyone who supported Mrs. Clinton hurt her feelings. He told her he didn<U+2019>t realize she was hurt at the time and didn<U+2019>t mean it to be a personal attack. He apologized. She isn<U+2019>t sure they could have had the same conversation earlier. <U+201C>Emotions were just too raw,<U+201D> says Ms. Ingram. With the election over, households that split their votes are trying to put their relationships back together. The holidays are approaching, which means extended family<U+2014>many with opposing political views<U+2014>gathering. Avoiding an unsavory mix of gloat and gloom will require tact and tolerance. Craig Lambert, a marriage therapist in San Diego, Calif., was sad, angry and depressed that his girlfriend of three years backed Mr. Trump and didn<U+2019>t condemn the candidate<U+2019>s behavior toward women and comments about minorities. His girlfriend, Debbie Seid, who does executive and life coaching, was sad and disappointed that they couldn<U+2019>t have a civil and intellectual conversation. <U+201C>It was a real rupture in our relationship,<U+201D> says Mr. Lambert. <U+201C>We became polarized,<U+201D> she added. This weekend, they sat down and talked about how to move forward. Each agreed they need to listen and be more open- minded, rather than defensive, and focus on what they agree on. <U+201C>It was a very hopeful conversation,<U+201D> says Mr. Lambert. From The Wall Street Journal<U+2019>s <U+2018>Bonds: On Relationships<U+2019> column William Doherty, director of marriage and family therapy at the University of Minnesota, says politically opposed couples should put the presidential campaign in a box, leave it on the shelf and move on. <U+201C>If you didn<U+2019>t come to a consensus a year and a half ago, you<U+2019>re not going to come to one now that the election is over.<U+201D> People who need to vent about the outcome should do so with people who share the same view, but avoid getting locked into bitterness, he says. The vast majority of registered voters said they and their spouse or partner intended to vote for the same candidate, according to survey conducted a few weeks before the election by Pew Research Center. How to reconcile with friends and family who backed the other candidate. Source : William Doherty, director of marriage and family therapy at the University of Minnesota That puts the Ingrams, who have been married 21 years, in a minority. The couple, lifelong liberal Democrats, backed Bernie Sanders until he lost in the primary. To the disappointment of many friends and family, Mr. Ingram began backing Mr. Trump and posting pro-Trump messages on Facebook and Twitter . One of his adult stepsons unfriended him on Facebook. Ms. Ingram decided to back Mrs. Clinton, joining her parents and most of her extended family. The Ingram front lawn, with signs for both Trump and Clinton, became a curiosity in this Republican dominated rural part of Pennsylvania. At home, they tried to keep things civil, not discussing politics at the dinner table. Ms. Ingram, who is 52 and working as a physical therapist, would come home to her husband, Jay, 71, who is retired. <U+201C>I would walk in the door and he would ask if I heard this about Trump and this about Hillary,<U+201D> she says. She would listen for five minutes and go upstairs. If he continued, she would hold her hand up, making a peace sign and signaling for him to stop. Ms. Ingram said her support for Mrs. Clinton became lukewarm in the month before the election when more email questions were raised. She said she made up her mind on election day but refused to tell her husband how she cast her ballot. <U+201C>If Hillary won, I didn<U+2019>t want to hear <U+2018>It<U+2019>s your fault<U+2019> for anything that went wrong in the next four years,<U+201D> she says. She also didn<U+2019>t want to hear her husband bragging <U+201C>I won, I won<U+201D> if Mr. Trump was elected. The night of the election they both went to bed at about 10. The next morning, Ms. Ingram said she was standing in the kitchen, getting ready to make coffee, when she looked up and saw a smile spread across her husband<U+2019>s face when he logged onto his computer. Both he and their oldest son, who also voted for Mr. Trump, were elated. She didn<U+2019>t react one way or the other, and wouldn<U+2019>t say how she voted. As the day wore on and into the next day, though, she said she felt disappointed as the implications sank in about possible changes in health care, environmental policies and the Supreme Court, issues that she feels passionate about. When her husband became smug, she told him he was gloating and he stopped. He no longer comments on Facebook about the election and took down his earlier posts. <U+201C>I just didn<U+2019>t want to deal with it anymore,<U+201D> he says. She is glad that she no longer comes home from work to hear reports of who did what on the campaign trail. That, in itself, eliminated some tension and source of conflict. Some ill will remains. Mr. Ingram says he doesn<U+2019>t plan on attending Thanksgiving or Christmas at his in-laws, which is fine with them. <U+201C>I would prefer he would not come,<U+201D> says Cathy<U+2019>s mother, Jenny Marsden. Ms. Ingram would like her husband to join everyone. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m a little torn of course but I don<U+2019>t want everyone to be walking on eggshells and no one to have a good time.<U+201D> She hopes that by Christmas things will be more calm and the family can all be together.

Together, with the other two provinces that have high rates of the disease, the three account for over half of the cases of HIV/AIDS in the entire country. \n80% of new HIV cases occur due to homosexual activity. \nThe kits retail for $4.40 and can be taken as a urine test to determine whether or not students need to seek medical attention. Those who purchase the test will collect their urine and send it to a laboratory, and then access the results online. This can all be done completely anonymously. \nSimilar kits can be purchased online, but they retail for around $45. The cheaper vending machine tests are just as accurate and are partially subsidized by a charity to allow the test to be more accessible. \nReports state that the Chinese have limited sex education and very little is discussed about HIV or AIDS. Many students who suspect they may have the disease do not seek medical help because of its link to homosexuality. Those who do have HIV are often thought to be pariahs by their families and friends because of its connection with same-sex encounters. \nThe disease is mostly spreading amongst young homosexual men, but as with anywhere else, women who do not use proper protection are also susceptible to becoming infected. \nDoctors have stated that most young people who have become infected with HIV/AIDS in China lacked proper education and did not take appropriate precautions for prevention. \nThe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) states that there are currently about half a million people in China living with HIV or AIDS, however this figure may be inaccurate due to underreporting.",

Britain is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia's borders as part of a huge military deployment. A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia next spring, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said. The move is part of the biggest military build up of NATO troops on Russia's borders since the Cold War . <U+00A9> REX Mr Fallon said the deployment of the battalion, supported by French and Danish troops, will start from May 2017. \"Although we are leaving the European Union, we will be doing more to help secure the eastern and southern flanks of NATO,\" Mr Fallon said. London is also sending Typhoon fighter aircraft to Romania to patrol around the Black Sea, partly in support of Turkey. It comes after an increase in tensions between the West and Russia in recent months. Earlier this month, 40 million Russians reportedly carried out nuclear evacuation tests after officials warned that the West wanted to launch strikes on the country. NATO is now pressing allies including the US and Britain to contribute to the military presence as the alliance prepares for a long quarrel with Moscow. Last week, a Russian aircraft carrier passed through the English Channel as it traveled to Syria in a show of force along Europe's shores. Alliance defense ministers aim to make good on a July promise by NATO leaders to send forces to the Baltic states and eastern Poland from early next year. The United States hopes for binding commitments from Europe to fill four battle groups of some 4,000 troops, part of NATO's response to Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and concern it could try a similar tactic in Europe's ex-Soviet states. Comment: This propaganda still lives despite Russia showing no interest invading any country. France, Denmark, Italy and other allies are expected to join the four battle groups led by the United States, Germany, Britain and Canada to go to Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, with forces ranging from armored infantry to drones. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the commitments would be \"a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond.\" Diplomats said it would also send a message to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has complained that European allies do not pay their way in the alliance. The battle groups will be backed by NATO's 40,000-strong rapid-reaction force, and if need be, further follow-on forces, for any potential conflict, which could move into Baltic states and Poland on rotation. The strategy is part of an emerging new deterrent that could eventually be combined with missile defenses, air patrols and defenses against cyber attacks. However, the alliance is still struggling for a similar strategy in the Black Sea region, which Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said is becoming a \"Russian lake\" because of Moscow's military presence there. Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are expected to soon come forward with a plan to increase naval and air patrols in the area, as well as a multinational NATO brigade in Romania. For the Kremlin, the U.S.-led alliance's plans are already too much given Russia's grievances at NATO's expansion eastwards. Stoltenberg denied going too far. \"This is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict.\" Comment: Stoltenberg's thinking is flawed since moving troops to a country's border based on no threats is an act of aggression that promotes conflict. Next year's deployments have taken on greater symbolism since Russia pulled out of several nuclear disarmament agreements in the past two months while moving nuclear-capable missiles into its Baltic exclave in Kaliningrad. The so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. \"This deployment, if it becomes permanent, if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russia's) security posture,\" the United States' envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, said. Tensions have been building since Crimea and the West's decision to impose retaliatory sanctions, but the breakdown of a U.S-Russia brokered ceasefire in Syria on October 3, followed by U.S. accusations that Russia has used cyber attacks to disrupt the presidential election, have signaled a sharp worsening of East-West relations. EU leaders met last week to consider fresh sanctions over Russian bombing of civilian areas in Aleppo and NATO's Stoltenberg said he fears the Russian warships heading to the Mediterranean could launch new attacks on the Syrian city. Even before the break down of the Syrian ceasefire, Russian President Vladimir Putin suspended a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium, signalling he was willing to use nuclear disarmament as a new bargaining chip in disputes with the United States over Ukraine and Syria.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Michael Snyder \n source: freedomoutpost.com \n text: Email \nWill this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , <U+201C>voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere.<U+201D> Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. \nMany officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News <U+2026> \nSeveral schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. \nThe fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. \n<U+201C>If anybody can sit there and say they don<U+2019>t think this is a contentious election, then they aren<U+2019>t paying much attention,<U+201D> Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. \nAnd without a doubt, voting locations are <U+201C>soft targets<U+201D> that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters <U+2026> \n<U+201C>There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didn<U+2019>t have 15 or 20 years ago,<U+201D> said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. <U+201C> What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then that<U+2019>s certainly concerning.<U+201D> \nAll it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. \nLet us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. \nAnother reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania <U+2026> \n<U+201C>We don<U+2019>t want to lose an election because you know what I<U+2019>m talking about,<U+201D> Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. <U+201C>Because you know what? That<U+2019>s a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places .<U+201D> \nAnd of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats<U+2026> \nEarly voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. \nRepublican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. \n<U+201C>I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent,<U+201D> Moynihan said. <U+201C>You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat.<U+201D> \nIn addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . \nWell, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation <U+2026> \nAccording to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. \nThe McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation <U+2013> apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 <U+2013> when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? \nEither way, it doesn<U+2019>t look good. \nAfter everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. \nBut Democrats don<U+2019>t like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters<U+2026> \n<U+201C>It<U+2019>s un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that ,<U+201D> Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book <U+201C> Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America ,<U+201D> previously told The Christian Science Monitor. <U+201C>Voting was very, very dangerous. I don<U+2019>t think anyone<U+2019>s suggesting that we<U+2019>re at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic.<U+201D> \nWithout a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. \nBut will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? \nIf that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed. \nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare Don't forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook , Google Plus , & Twitter .

Meanwhile, fresh data and central-bank chatter will illuminate the economic outlook in the U.S. and Europe. MONDAY : Japan on Monday (Sunday evening in the U.S.) will release third-quarter gross domestic product data, with economists expecting an annualized growth rate of 0.9%. Despite a third consecutive quarter of expansion, the data will likely show Japan<U+2019>s recovery is still fragile. Spending by households and businesses is expected to be near flat, with growth due mostly to a rise in exports. Also Monday (Sunday night EST), investors will pore over the biggest data release on China<U+2019>s October calendar for signs that industrial production remains relatively stable in response to months of easy-money policies and stepped-up fiscal spending. The expectation is that IP growth will edge up to 6.2% compared with September<U+2019>s 6.1% reading. Economists also will scrutinize f ixed-asset investment data -- which they expect to show year-to-date growth of 8.2%, up from 8.1% through September -- for signs that weak private investment is rebounding. And markets will digest official October property numbers amid concern that this important growth engine could slow too precipitously following the recent purchase restrictions imposed in top Chinese markets. TUESDAY : Statistics agencies across Europe are expected to announce another quarter of weak growth. Germany<U+2019>s statistics agency will release its first estimate of gross domestic product during the three months to September and is expected to record a slight slowdown in the quarter-to-quarter growth rate to 0.3% from 0.4%. The European Union<U+2019>s statistics agency will release its second estimate of economic activity in the eurozone and is expected to leave its growth calculation unchanged at 0.3%. If the U.S. economy is to end the year on a strong note, it will need support from consumers. The Commerce Department on Tuesday will release retail-sales data for October, allowing forecasters to firm up their early predictions for fourth-quarter GDP growth. Economists predict headline retail sales rose 0.5% in October from the prior month and sales were up 0.4% excluding autos. WEDNESDAY : Bank of Canada Deputy Gov. Timothy Lane speaks in Waterloo, Ontario, and market watchers will look for any hints on the central bank<U+2019>s view of the U.S. election results. The U.S. is Canada<U+2019>s biggest trading partner and the destination for roughly three-quarters of Canadian exports. THURSDAY : The U.S. Federal Reserve has been laying the groundwork for a mid-December rate increase followed by a gradual path of rate increases in the coming years. Might Mr. Trump<U+2019>s surprise victory upend those plans? Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen could offer clarity when she makes her first post-election remarks during testimony before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. Also Thursday, the European Central Bank will publish minutes of its October policy meeting, shedding light on discussions within the ECB<U+2019>s governing council as it prepares to decide whether to extend its <U+20AC>1.7 trillion stimulus. President Mario Draghi said last month that policy makers hadn<U+2019>t discussed the future of their bond-purchase program, which is due to end in March. Still, the minutes could show how concerned council members are about the eurozone<U+2019>s weak growth and ultralow inflation rate, as well as the political uncertainty outside the bloc including in the U.S.",

Budget deficits<U+00A0>fell from 2010 until last year but are on track to climb in the next decade, even before factoring in new spending proposals or revenue-reducing tax cuts. <U+201C>You can<U+2019>t just like spending that your party wants and dislike spending that the other party wants,<U+201D> says Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R., S.C.), who rode to office in 2010 on the tea party wave. Still, Mr. Mulvaney and other congressional Republicans say tax-cut-induced deficits<U+00A0>aren<U+2019>t the same as ones brought on by increased spending, in part because they believe the former can<U+00A0>generate growth in ways that<U+00A0>recoup lost revenues over time. This suggests the GOP will be willing to<U+00A0>tolerate<U+00A0>higher deficits in the short-run under Mr. Trump because the party is largely united on overhauling corporate and individual income taxes.<U+00A0>Democrats say there is no proof tax cuts pay for themselves. And reduced revenues, they worry, could be used to justify big cuts to safety-net programs like food stamps and Medicaid. For Republicans, the bigger fight will be over Mr. Trump<U+2019>s proposed infrastructure plan. The president-elect has been passionate about rebuilding roads and ports but sketchy on the details of how to pay for it, stirring concerns among Republicans who are uneasy over approving a costly stimulus program. <U+201C>A fairly nonideological Donald Trump will bump up against some fairly ideological members of the House conference,<U+201D> says Rep. Charlie Dent (R. Pa.), a moderate Republican who didn<U+2019>t back Mr. Trump. Under current policy, the Congressional Budget Office sees the budget deficit of 3.2% of gross domestic product holding around those levels for the next four years. By the end of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s first term, deficits would rise to 5.3% of GDP under the House Republicans<U+2019> tax plan, and to 6.8% under Mr. Trump<U+2019>s proposal, according to an analysis by Cornerstone Macro, a research firm. The last two times Republicans reclaimed the White House from Democrats<U+2014>in 1981 and 2001<U+2014>they also successfully pushed for large tax cuts. Deficits nonetheless rose during their administrations. Mr. Trump inherits a much weaker fiscal position than Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush did. When Mr. Reagan took office, the Congressional Budget Office projected the U.S. would run a surplus of 2% of GDP over the coming five years, while in 2001, they projected even larger surpluses of 3.3%. By contrast, the U.S. is now running rising deficits, and the federal debt stands at about 77% of GDP, compared with 25% in 1981 and 31% in 2001. Concerns about deficits over the past few years have faded because economic growth remains disappointing and because Washington took several steps to cut spending and increase taxes after deficits jumped in 2009. Deficits have also fallen below projections in recent years due to a surprising decline in the growth rate of health care spending and because interest rates have been lower than projected. Mr. Trump and his advisers have brushed aside deficit worries and say many forecasts don<U+2019>t account for growth that may result from their entire economic agenda. Without stronger economic growth, they say the country won<U+2019>t stand a chance turning back deficits facing stiff demographic headwinds from the retirement of the baby boom generation. Already, Mr. Trump has forsworn any changes to the largest future drivers of spending, Social Security and Medicare. <U+201C>Is Trump going to get a little deference because he<U+2019>s in the same party? Perhaps,<U+201D> says Mr. Mulvaney. Mr. Trump has acknowledged potential divisions with his own party while also playing them down.<U+00A0>He told the New York Times last week he hadn<U+2019>t realized his plan for <U+201C>a very large infrastructure bill<U+201D> was <U+201C>not a very Republican thing.<U+201D> Then he added, <U+201C>Let<U+2019>s see if I get it done. Right now they<U+2019>re in love with me, OK?<U+201D> Mr. Trump<U+2019>s advisers have floated different ideas, including an infrastructure bank or a plan to use tax credits to spur up to $1 trillion in spending by private developers. Critics say that idea wouldn<U+2019>t help many of the nation<U+2019>s most critical needs and would leave out large pools of tax-exempt capital. Other advisers say they are open to recycling a proposal made by President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to pay for infrastructure with one-time revenues from taxing multinationals<U+2019> profits stashed abroad. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, has echoed arguments made in recent years by left-leaning economists who supported more spending to boost growth. <U+201C>With negative interest rates throughout the world, it<U+2019>s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything,<U+201D> Mr. Bannon said in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter. <U+201C>Shipyards, ironworks, get them all jacked up. We<U+2019>re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks.<U+201D> Write to Nick<U+00A0>Timiraos at Nick.Timiraos@wsj.com",

The popular vote leaves the FBI far out on the limb for its corrupt clearance of Hillary. The agency now has to redeem itself. \nI myself do not know what precisely to think. Having been at the top of the Washington hierarchy for a quarter century, I have seen many mistaken judgments. At one time I had subpoena power over the CIA and was able to inform President Reagan that the CIA had misled him. He took note and proceeded with his policy of ending the Cold War with the Soviets. On other issues I have been mistaken, because I assumed that there was more integrity in government than actually exists. \nHowever, FBI director Comey did not need to reopen the case against Hillary simply because some new incriminating emails appeared. Having dismissed the other incriminating evidence, these emails could have passed unremarked. \nThe problem for the FBI, which once was a trusted American institution, but no longer is, is that there is no longer any doubt that Donald Trump will win the popular vote for president of the United States. His appearances are so heavily attended that thousands are turned away by local fire/occupancy regulations. In contrast, Hillary has curtailed her appearances, because she doesn<U+2019>t draw more than 30 or 40 people. \nAmericans are sick to death of the corrupt Clintons and the corrupt American media. The Clintons are so completely bought-and-paid-for by the Oligarchy that they were able to outspend Hollywood on their daughter<U+2019>s wedding, dropping $3,000,000 on the event. \nNevertheless, I don<U+2019>t underestimate the power of the Oligarchy. As Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury I experienced the Oligarchy<U+2019>s power. If I had not been backed by the President of the United States, I would have been destroyed. \nIndeed, the Oligarchy is still trying to destroy me. \nPossibly Trump, as his enemies allerge, is just another fake, like Obama who misled the electorate. However, Trump attacks the Oligarchy so strongly that it is hard to believe that Trump isn<U+2019>t real. Trump is asking for a bullet like John F. Kennedy, like Robert Kennedy, like Martin Luther King, like George Wallace. \nIn Amerika, dissidents are exterminated. \nTrump is up against voting machines over which he has no control. If there are no INDEPENDENT exit polls, Trump can easily be robbed of the election, as the Texas early voting scandal indicates, with the electronic machines assigning Trump votes to Hillary. The <U+201C>glitch<U+201D> doesn<U+2019>t assign any Hillary votes to Trump. \nMy expectation is that, unless Trump<U+2019>s popular vote is so overwhelming, the electoral collage vote will be stolen. Because of the absence of any valid reporting by the presstitutes, I don<U+2019>t know what impact the orchestrated election of Hillary would have on the electorate. Possibly, Americans will break out of The Matrix and take to the streets. \nI beleve that Hillary in the Oval Office would convince the Russians and the Chinese that their national survival requires a pre-emptive nuclear attack on the crazed, insane government of the United States, the complete narcisstic state that in the words of Hillary and Obama is <U+201C>the exceptional, indispensible country,<U+201D> empowered by History to impose its will on the world. This crazed American agenda is not something that Russia and China will accept. \nHere is Donald Trump speaking to Americans in words Americans have been waiting to hear: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8prvxjW2wM \nNotice that Trump doesn<U+2019>t need teleprompters. \nI do not agree with Trump on many issues, but the American people do. For me and for the world, the importance of Trump is the prospect of peace with Russia. Nuclear war makes every other problem irrelevant. \nIf Hillary is installed by the Oligarchy<U+2014>this is a word used by former Democratic President Jimmy Carter who said that the US is no longer a functioning democracy but is ruled by an Oligarchy<U+2014>war with Russia and China will be upon us. \nAfter 15 years the Taliban and ISIS still run wild in the Middle East despite the efforts of the American <U+201C>superpower.<U+201D> Unable to defeat a few lightly armied Taiban after 15 years, what prospects does the enfeebled US have of winning a conflict with Russia and China? \nNone whatsoever. \nThe United States has had an entire generation of people born into a war for which the purpose is inexplicable. Why these wars? Why this endless slaughter of women and children and endless columns of refugees overwhelming all of Europe desperately striving to escape Washington<U+2019>s wars of world hegemony. Why do not the total dumbshits in Washington hear when the President of Russia says that <U+201C>Russia can no longer tolerate the state of affairs that Washington has created in the world.<U+201D> \nThe unjustified arrogance of Washington, a washed up Third World State, is likely to destroy life on earth. No greater danger to life exists than Washington. We have to hope that Trump can clean out the Augean Stables. (Reprinted from PaulCraigRoberts.org",

Tweaking that for an insurance company was pretty easy. \n<U+201C>I simply liked a number of Facebook pages about driver safety, signed a petition calling for lower speed limits on UK roads, added a couple of driving safety courses as Life Events, and even put a couple of posts on my historic timeline about how people are <U+2018>driving way too fast past the school these days<U+2019>. \n<U+201C>Also, Driving Miss Daisy is now my favourite film, by the way. \n<U+201C>It would definitely have got me cheaper car insurance.

This morning, he shot and killed two cops in cold blood as they sat in their patrol cars. Greene, 46, was arrested a few hours later after an intense manhunt. \nBelow is a video he posted on YouTube, along with a screenshot of his comment referring to the black teens as cop haters for not standing during the national anthem at high school game, which caused him to throw a fit of rage leading to him eventually being kicked out of the stadium. \nHe was angry at police after they had kicked him out of the football game for waving a Confederate flag in front of a group of black students in Urbandale on October 14, 2016. Two days later, he posted the infamous video to YouTube from the encounter titled, <U+201C>Police Abuse, Civil Rights Violation at Urbandale High School 10/14/16.<U+201D> \nOf course, neither Trump nor his campaign have said anything about the killings except a tweet offering the old tired <U+201C>thoughts and prayers.<U+201D> \nIn the video, he tries to explain to the cops kicking him out that he was doing nothing more than expressing his First Amendment rights to wave the Confederate flag. He also said he was assaulted and had his flag stolen from him. However, police said he was causing a disturbance and that he would be arrested for trespassing on school property if he did not leave. They also returned his flag to him. \nWhile they agreed he had a Constitutional right to wave the flag, they informed him that on school grounds, he was subject to school policies that did not allow the waving of the Confederate flag. Less than a week ago, he stated in the comments section of his video that he was <U+201C>offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem<U+201D> and referred to them as being <U+201C>cop haters.<U+201D> Now, he is a suspected cop killer. Greene has a long history of arrests, including one incident where he threatened to kill a black man after calling him a racial slur. He also went though mental evaluation and was placed on medication. \nAccording to the Des Moines Register: \nHe was charged with a simple misdemeanor count of interference with official acts on April 10, 2014, when he resisted an attempt by officers to pat him down for weapons at an Urbandale residence on Colby Parkway, according to a criminal complaint. The officers wanted to search Greene after noticing that he had a pouch on his belt that resembled a holster. \nGreene was <U+201C>noncompliant, hostile, combative and made furtive movements toward his pockets<U+201D> before the arrest, Officer Chris Greenfield wrote in the complaint. Greene pleaded guilty to the charge about two weeks later. \nThe complaint does not indicate why officers initially came into contact with Greene. But two days later he reportedly threatened to kill a man in the parking lot of the same apartment complex and he was charged with first-degree harassment, according to another complaint. \nIn that incident, Greene was accused of approaching a man in the parking lot and shined a flashlight in his eyes. Greene, who lived in the apartments, called the man the N-word and told the man <U+201C>I will kill you, (expletive) kill you,<U+201D> according to the complaint. Greene pleaded guilty to a lesser harassment charge on June 30, 2014, and was sentenced to one year of probation. \nIn a discharge report filed in June 2015 a probation officer wrote that Greene had received a mental health evaluation and <U+201C>reports to have complied with the medication recommendations.<U+201D> \nWatch this confederate flag obsessed cop-killer<U+2019>s YouTube video:",

The three dead were in separate locations outside of Gatlinburg, Fire Chief Greg Miller said Tuesday afternoon at a press conference. The fires under way in Gatlinburg are the worst in the state in 100 years, according to Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam. Present-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence called him to offer support, he said. Mayor Mike Werner, who lost his home and business to the flames, said the fires spread so quickly Monday night that <U+201C>people were basically running for their lives.<U+201D> The city will be under curfew Tuesday night into Wednesday morning, he said. Wildfires fanned by strong winds forced evacuations<U+00A0>Monday night in the Tennessee towns of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, popular tourist destinations in the Smoky Mountains. People abandoned homes and businesses, including Dolly Parton <U+2019>s amusement park Dollywood. The winds came ahead of rain, the first substantial amount for the region in months, which brought relief for firefighters battling large drought-induced blazes across southern Appalachia. Another rain front is expected Wednesday. Despite the rain, smoke filled the air. <U+201C>The smell is terrible; I can<U+2019>t hardly breathe,<U+201D> said Cynthia Grantham, owner of the Riverchase Motel in Pigeon Forge. Her 112-room motel wasn<U+2019>t evacuated, but she watched nervously as other sections of Pigeon Forge were. A mere three rooms in the motel were occupied during what should be her busy season, she said. She lived in the area for decades and never saw wildfires this extensive, she said. <U+201C>We need that rain bad,<U+201D> she said. More than 14,000 people<U+2014>tourists and residents<U+2014>evacuated the Gatlinburg area, according to a statement issued Tuesday morning by the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. About 100 homes in Sevier County, next to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, were damaged by the fires, according to TEMA. About 30 businesses, including a 16-story hotel and an apartment building, both in Gatlinburg, were damaged. Major roads into Gatlinburg were closed. By Tuesday morning, about 1,100 people were gathered at emergency shelters in the area. About 100 Tennessee National Guard troops were sent to help. <U+201C>Even with the rain that is currently falling there, the fires continue to burn and structures remain engulfed with little hope that the rainfall will bring immediate relief,<U+201D> the TEMA statement read. Storms brought about a half an inch of rain to east Tennessee on Tuesday, and new storms should bring another inch or so Wednesday, said David Hotz, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Morristown, Tenn. Winds ahead of the second rain front will be <U+201C>very gusty,<U+201D> however, raising concerns that the fires could spread before new rains arrive, he said. There rain is welcome, but it is too early to tell how much of an impact it will have on the fires, said Adam Rondeau, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s going to be a help,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>In the next 24 hours we<U+2019>re going to see some definite results.<U+201D> As of<U+00A0>Tuesday morning, firefighters were battling 20 large fires<U+2014>blazes burning 100 acres or more<U+2014>across the U.S. Southeast, Mr. Rondeau said. The fires, some of which officials suspect were intentionally set, have destroyed tens of thousands of acres across the South in recent weeks. A severe drought that began earlier this summer has created conditions for wildfires to spread quickly. Smoke from the blazes has hurt air quality across the region, including in major cities such as Atlanta and Charlotte. States including Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, Alabama, Kentucky and Virginia imposed outdoor fire bans and other measures. Write to Cameron McWhirter at cameron.mcwhirter@wsj.com",
