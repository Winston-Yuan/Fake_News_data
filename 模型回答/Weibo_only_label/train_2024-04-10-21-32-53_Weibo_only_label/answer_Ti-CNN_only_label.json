Recipient Name Recipient Email => \n<U+201C>If I don<U+2019>t win, this will be the greatest waste of time, money and energy in my lifetime,<U+201D> says Donald Trump. \nHerewith, a dissent. Whatever happens Tuesday, Trump has made history and has forever changed American politics. \nThough a novice in politics, he captured the Party of Lincoln with the largest turnout of primary voters ever, and he has inflicted wounds on the nation<U+2019>s ruling class from which it may not soon recover. \nBush I and II, Mitt Romney, the neocons and the GOP commentariat all denounced Trump as morally and temperamentally unfit. Yet, seven of eight Republicans are voting for Trump, and he drew the largest and most enthusiastic crowds of any GOP nominee. \nNot only did he rout the Republican elites, he ash-canned their agenda and repudiated the wars into which they plunged the country. \nTrump did not create the forces that propelled his candidacy. But he recognized them, tapped into them, and unleashed a gusher of nationalism and populism that will not soon dissipate. \nWhatever happens Tuesday, there is no going back now. \nHow could the Republican establishment advance anew the trade and immigration policies that their base has so thunderously rejected? \nHow can the GOP establishment credibly claim to speak for a party that spent the last year cheering a candidate who repudiated the last two Republican presidents and the last two Republican nominees? \nDo mainstream Republicans think that should Trump lose a Bush Restoration lies ahead? The dynasty is as dead as the Romanovs. \nThe media, whose reputation has sunk to Congressional depths, has also suffered a blow to its credibility. \nIts hatred of Trump has been almost manic, and WikiLeaks revelations of the collusion between major media and Clintonites have convinced skeptics that the system is rigged and the referees of democracy are in the tank. \nBut it is the national establishment that has suffered most. \nThe Trump candidacy exposed what seems an unbridgeable gulf between this political class and the nation in whose name it purports to speak. \nConsider the litany of horrors it has charged Trump with. \nHe said John McCain was no hero, that some Mexican illegals are <U+201C>rapists.<U+201D> He mocked a handicapped reporter. He called some women <U+201C>pigs.<U+201D> He wants a temporary ban to Muslim immigration. He fought with a Gold Star mother and father. He once engaged in <U+201C>fat-shaming<U+201D> a Miss Universe, calling her <U+201C>Miss Piggy,<U+201D> and telling her to stay out of Burger King. He allegedly made crude advances on a dozen women and starred in the <U+201C>Access Hollywood<U+201D> tape with Billy Bush. \nWhile such <U+201C>gaffes<U+201D> are normally fatal for candidates, Trump<U+2019>s followers stood by him through them all. \nWhy? asks an alarmed establishment. Why, in spite of all this, did Trump<U+2019>s support endure? Why did the American people not react as they once would have? Why do these accusations not have the bite they once did? \nAnswer. We are another country now, an us-or-them country. \nMiddle America believes the establishment is not looking out for the nation but for retention of its power. And in attacking Trump it is not upholding some objective moral standard but seeking to destroy a leader who represents a grave threat to that power. \nTrump<U+2019>s followers see an American Spring as crucial, and they are not going to let past boorish behavior cause them to abandon the last best chance to preserve the country they grew up in. \nThese are the Middle American Radicals, the MARs of whom my late friend Sam Francis wrote. \nThey recoil from the future the elites have mapped out for them and, realizing the stakes, will overlook the faults and failings of a candidate who holds out the real promise of avoiding that future. \nThey believe Trump alone will secure the borders and rid us of a trade regime that has led to the loss of 70,000 factories and 5 million manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. They believe Trump is the best hope for keeping us out of the wars the Beltway think tanks are already planning for the sons of the <U+201C>deplorables<U+201D> to fight. \nMoreover, they see the establishment as the quintessence of hypocrisy. Trump is instructed to stop using such toxic phrases as <U+201C>America First<U+201D> and <U+201C>Make America Great Again<U+201D> by elites who think 55 million abortions since Roe is a milestone of moral progress. \nAnd what do they have in common with a woman who thinks partial-birth abortion, which her predecessor in the Senate, Pat Moynihan, called <U+201C>infanticide,<U+201D> is among the cherished <U+201C>reproductive rights<U+201D> of women? \nWhile a Trump victory would create the possibility of a coalition of conservatives, populists, patriots and nationalists governing America, should he lose, America<U+2019>s future appears disunited and grim. \nBut, would the followers of Donald Trump, whom Hillary Clinton has called <U+201C>racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic <U+2026> bigots,<U+201D> to the cheers of her media retainers, unite behind her should she win? \nNo. Win or lose, as Sen. Edward Kennedy said at the Democratic Convention of 1980, <U+201C>The work goes on, the cause endures.<U+201D> \nPatrick J. Buchanan is the author of the new book <U+201C>The Greatest Comeback: How Richard Nixon Rose From Defeat to Create the New Majority.<U+201D> \nCopyight 2016 Creators.com.",

PHOTOS: Everyday Home Hides Most Incredible 1950s Bomb Shelter We<U+2019>ve Ever Seen \nHowever, lecturer Thomas Neff soon realized that he was receiving abnormally high readings on the Geiger counter, so he began moving about the room in an effort to track down the anomaly. \nHe eventually came upon a display of various rocks, minerals and fossils, in front of which his Geiger counter veritably <U+201C>exploded<U+201D> off the charts, giving a reading of 102,000 counts per minute, about 100 times greater than the radioactivity of the watch, which itself was roughly 20 times greater than that which occurs normally. \nNeff quickly halted his lecture and alerted school authorities, who immediately began evacuating students and faculty while experts were brought in to assess the danger and rectify the situation.   \nAn alert was also sent out to other schools in the region, where subsequent searches of those locations turned up another 38 radioactive rocks in 11 different schools. \nThe uranium rocks have now been gathered in a safe place, though there is no word whether any students or teachers became sick from their exposure to the potentially deadly material . \nPlease share on Facebook and Twitter to spread this story about radioactive materials in the classroom.",

The Times report includes another such account, from 2005; and more stories appeared late Wednesday in, inter alia, People and the Palm Beach Post . If there is still a Trump election comeback scenario, it is beyond this columnist<U+2019>s imaginative capacity. Even Scott Adams now believes <U+201C>[Hillary Clinton] will win easily.<U+201D> He observes: He<U+2019>s right about the power of Leeds<U+2019>s simile but overimpressed with expertise. Why couldn<U+2019>t a <U+201C>civilian<U+201D> come up with a vivid way of describing her own experience, especially when she<U+2019>s had more than 30 years to think about it? A lawyer for Trump responded with a letter <U+2014>emailed to the campaign<U+2019>s press list, which includes this columnist<U+2014>to Times executive editor Dean Baquet. The letter asserted that the article <U+201C>is reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel per se<U+201D> and demanded <U+201C>a full and immediate retraction and apology.<U+201D> Follow James on Twitter Implicit in such a correspondence is the threat of a lawsuit, but how would that go? We have it on good authority that there exists a video recording in which Trump acknowledges having engaged in behavior similar to that described by the Times<U+2019>s sources. Combine that with their eyewitness testimony, and it would be quite a challenge for the plaintiff to muster a preponderance of the evidence. Anyway, surely Trump does not want to go through discovery in such a case. If there is a lawsuit, it<U+2019>s a safe bet it<U+2019>ll be dropped after the election. The lawyer letter serves chiefly as a political document<U+2014>a claim that, to paraphrase, there<U+2019>s a lot of smoke and there<U+2019>s no fire . Many Republicans, including Trump opponents, are raising questions about the timing of the story. This is adapted from a tweetstorm last night by a Nevertrump conservative who goes by the handle <U+201C> Polimath <U+201D>: He also notes that in May, just after Trump clinched the nomination, the Times published a lengthy investigation into his dealings with women, which the story itself described as <U+201C>a complex, at times contradictory portrait of a wealthy, well-known and provocative man and the women around him, one that defies simple categorization.<U+201D> Meanwhile, stolen emails published by WikiLeaks provide a wealth of evidence that the Clinton campaign has a cozy relationship with prominent media figures: <U+2022> <U+201C>Donna Brazile, the current head of the Democratic National Committee, appears to have tipped the Clinton campaign off to a question about the death penalty that was going to be asked during a CNN town hall in March,<U+201D> the Daily Caller reports. Brazile was a CNN contributor at the time. <U+2022> The Washington Times reports after ABC<U+2019>s George Stephanopoulos interviewed <U+201C>Clinton Cash<U+201D> author Peter Schweizer in April 2015, a campaign aide wrote: <U+201C>Great work everyone. This interview is perfect. [Schweizer] lands nothing and everything is refuted (mostly based on our work).<U+201D> Stephanopoulos worked in Bill Clinton<U+2019>s 1992 campaign and White House. <U+2022> NewsBusters (citing another report from the Daily Caller ) notes that <U+201C>CNBC correspondent and infamously biased [GOP] debate moderator John Harwood engaged in a variety of flattering conversations with [John] Podesta and other Clinton officials,<U+201D> including one <U+201C>lobbying for a fawning interview with Clinton that he promised would be a <U+2018>deep .<U+00A0>.<U+00A0>. conversation about the economy that she wants.<U+2019><U+00A0><U+201D> <U+2022> The Intercept , a left-wing (and not pro-Clinton) site, reports that a <U+201C>strategy document<U+201D> from January 2015 <U+201C>singled out reporter Maggie Haberman, then of Politico, now covering the election for the New York Times, as a <U+2018>friendly journalist<U+2019> who has <U+2019>teed up<U+2019> stories for them in the past and <U+2018>never disappointed<U+2019> them.<U+201D> <U+2022> The Washington Free Beacon reports that the campaign <U+201C>bragged [that] <U+2018>every single interviewer was for her<U+2019> during a visit to Michigan during the Democratic primary season.<U+201D> It<U+2019>s reminiscent of the 2010 <U+201C>JournoList<U+201D> leak, which revealed that liberal and ostensibly nonideological journalists had conspired to suppress news inconvenient to Democrats during the 2008 campaign. Only this time it<U+2019>s hardly a revelation. With Trump as the Republican nominee, journalists have been increasingly open about their partisanship. A canonical example is Jim Rutenberg <U+2019>s front-page New York Times column urging his colleagues to <U+201C>throw out the textbook American journalism has been using for the better part of the past half-century, if not longer<U+201D><U+2014>that is, to give up fairness and objectivity and become <U+201C>oppositional.<U+201D> As we suspected , that wasn<U+2019>t just one columnist<U+2019>s opinion. <U+201C>I thought Jim Rutenberg<U+2019>s column nailed it,<U+201D> Baquet, the Times<U+2019>s executive editor, said last week in an interview with Harvard<U+2019>s NiemanLab . Of Trump, Baquet observed: <U+201C>He will have changed journalism, he really will have.<U+201D> That<U+2019>s true, but only in the sense that he has liberated journalists to become openly partisan. Which is ironic, because what has brought Trump low is not hysterical Hitler comparisons or tendentious <U+201C>fact checking<U+201D> (a genre this column identified as a corruption of journalism way back in 2008 ). It is old-fashioned reporting. What<U+2019>s galling about this is that the all-but-certain result will be a third White House term for the Clintons, whose record regarding the treatment of women (among other things) is as sordid as Trump<U+2019>s<U+2014>but who have been the beneficiaries of the partisan media double standard. That is in no way a defense of Trump, whose alleged behavior it would be equally outrageous to describe as <U+201C>his sex life,<U+201D> <U+201C>affairs,<U+201D> <U+201C>peccadilloes<U+201D> or any of the other Clinton euphemisms. Trump, the Clintons and the media<U+2019>s imbalance are all gross. If journalistic balance was just a pretense, maybe it<U+2019>s just as well that they give it up.

In a series of interviews on the Sunday political talk shows, Kellyanne Conway, a top Trump aide, argued firmly against tapping Romney for secretary of state, echoing internal skepticism among some in Trump's inner circle. Story Continued Below <U+201C>I<U+2019>m all for party unity, but I<U+2019>m not sure that we have to pay for that with the secretary of state position,<U+201D> Conway said in an interview with CNN. <U+201C>We don<U+2019>t even know if Mitt Romney voted for Donald Trump.<U+201D> Conway said her comments reflected conservatives' opposition to Romney, who was a frequent Trump critic during the presidential campaign. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s just breathtaking in scope and intensity,<U+201D> Conway said of the opposition to Romney among Trump supporters, characterizing their reaction as <U+201C>betrayal.<U+201D> The public Romney-bashing comes amid a behind-the-scenes battle for influence among Trump's top aides, with Conway and incoming White House senior strategist Steve Bannon arguing that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Trump loyalist, is the best pick for secretary of state. Meanwhile, Vice President-elect Mike Pence is said to be advocating for Romney, arguing that the former presidential candidate can be a bridge to centrist Republicans. By Matthew Nussbaum But some Republicans wondered aloud whether Conway's comments might be orchestrated by Trump himself as part of a campaign to embarrass Romney, noting Trump's penchant for headline-stealing public fights. Romney had called Trump <U+201C>a con man, phony and fraud<U+201D> during the campaign. \"Attacks on Romney not a solo act,\" Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, a vocal Trump critic, tweeted . \"Trump coordinated payback/humbling.\" In past episodes of Trump-camp strife aired on cable TV, Conway often deflected questions about internal disagreements. But Sunday, she doubled down on her critique <U+2014> as did former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, another Trump adviser, in an interview with Fox News on Sunday. <U+201C>I think there<U+2019>s nothing that Mitt Romney can say that doesn<U+2019>t sound phony and, frankly, pathetic,<U+201D> Gingrich said , adding later: <U+201C>Speaking for most of the Trump supporters, while we will support President-elect Trump and whatever he does, I think we would be enormously disappointed if he brought Mitt Romney into any position of authority.\" Those who believe Conway is trying to influence Trump<U+2019>s decision suggested that Sunday's news interviews may have been her best option. Trump is a rabid consumer of cable news and is said to be influenced by it, sometimes. But others tried to push back on the flood of anti-Romney rhetoric coming from some Trump advisers. \"Giuliani and Conway are trying to intimidate the President-elect. How weak do they think he is? Their lack of discretion is embarrassing,\" MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman who has a hot-and-cold relationship with the president-elect, tweeted on Sunday. He added in another tweet : \"Now all world leaders will be watching to see if a President Trump can be bullied by his staff.\" Meanwhile, the New York Post reported Saturday night that Trump asked guests at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida who he should nominate as secretary of state. While people close to Trump say Romney is a leading candidate for secretary of state, they also cast doubt on earlier news reports that suggested the president-elect is ready to nominate him. Reince Priebus, Trump<U+2019>s pick for chief of staff, downplayed reports of internal dissension. <U+201C>He<U+2019>s going to make the best decision for the American people,<U+201D> Priebus said of Trump on <U+201C>Fox News Sunday.<U+201D> <U+201C>It isn<U+2019>t a matter of warfare.<U+201D> Romney, for his part, has stayed largely silent since meeting with Trump earlier this month. Romney is spending time with his family in California. By Andrew Restuccia \"Gov. Romney is a man of great integrity and character, and President-Elect Trump deserves a lot of credit for even considering him for a job in his administration,\" said Ryan Williams, Romney's former spokesman, stressing that he hasn't spoken directly to Romney about the secretary of state job. \"I<U+2019>m not surprised to see that Mitt is staying above the fray and showing respect to the president-elect by letting him reach his own decision.\" Romney has sought to brandish his foreign policy credentials in recent months. During a June 2015 donor summit he hosted in Utah, Romney criticized President Barack Obama's foreign policy in a lengthy Power Point presentation. Trump's team did not confine its efforts Sunday to assailing Romney. On the heels of a Trump tweet portraying Hillary Clinton as a hypocrite, Conway took aim at Clinton's campaign for hitching itself to Jill Stein's \"ridiculously fantastical recount\" in Wisconsin. \"The question for the Democrats is, why are you doing this?\" Conway said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"And by the way, what does President Obama think of this recount charade?\" Alex Isenstadt, Matthew Nussbaum and Eliana Johnson contributed to this report.

What then? \nFar better to say, <U+201C>I expect to be treated kindly but if I am not I will discern what to do next.<U+201D> <U+201C>I expect to do my best, but when I do not, I will choose to learn.<U+201D> <U+201C>I expect others to be honest with me but when they betray my trust, I will walk away or let them know kindly what it takes to earn it once again.<U+201D> <U+201C>I expect my children to listen to me, but if they don<U+2019>t, I will lovingly guide them in their lessons here upon the earth.<U+201D> \nExpect the best of yourself and others dear ones, if you wish, but when you or they do not live up to these expectations, be flexible. Dance with the present moment, as you are, as life is, because in that reality you are no longer resisting life. You are no longer chained to your expectations in the past. You are open to guidance in the moment, dealing with reality of life in front of you. \nIn this fashion, you free yourself to find the most loving course of action based on how you are, how life is, and how others are being<U+2026> right here and right now, in the present moment.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Christopher Alessi \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-executive-leads-siemens-through-tough-times-1479983404 \n text: MUNICH<U+2014>When American Lisa Davis took over energy operations at Siemens AG in 2014, oil prices were near record highs and Europe<U+2019>s largest industrial company was bullish on the U.S. natural-gas market. Weeks after Ms. Davis assumed her post in Houston, the German manufacturing giant paid a rich premium to buy U.S. oil-equipment maker Dresser-Rand Group <U+2014>muscling onto rival General Electric Co. <U+2019>s home turf. But before the deal closed, oil prices tanked, with the global benchmark Brent dropping from highs around $115 a barrel in mid-2014 to below $30 at the start of this year, and recently trading just under $50. Now, GE<U+2019>s recently announced plan to link with oil-field services provider<U+00A0>Baker Hughes Inc. could stymie Siemens<U+2019>s energy ambitions. That transaction, announced last month, would create an energy powerhouse in the U.S. with more than $32 billion in revenue. Siemens posted oil-and-gas revenue for fiscal year 2016 of roughly EUR4.36 billion ($4.6 billion), according to estimates by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Shares of Siemens have risen 13% over the past year. Ms. Davis pledges to push on. <U+201C>Oil and gas is here to stay,<U+201D> she said in a recent interview. <U+201C>We are very committed to that marketplace and see it as a long-term bet.<U+201D> A former Royal Dutch Shell PLC<U+00A0>executive, Ms. Davis, 53 years old, must steer the beleaguered oil-and-gas unit through the downturn while integrating Dresser-Rand. Investors have questioned the price and timing of the $7.6 billion deal, which closed in mid-2015. Ms. Davis says she aims to make the energy unit more efficient to gain a competitive edge when oil prices rebound. For that, she is calling on Siemens<U+2019>s experience digitizing and automating factories. The Dresser-Rand deal, which came soon after Siemens paid<U+00A0>about $1.3 billon for Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC<U+2019>s energy operations, broadened the company<U+2019>s energy portfolio. That means the company can now offer a range of services and products, such as compressors, to a wide variety of customers, she said. <U+201C>And so we<U+2019>re there for the opportunities when they start to come back online.<U+201D> Ms. Davis also oversees Siemens<U+2019>s growing power-generation and wind-power divisions, which are vital to energy business profits. Siemens last year signed a EUR8 billion power-generation agreement with Egypt , the largest single order in its history. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to merge its wind operations with Spain<U+2019>s Gamesa Corporaci<U+00F3>n Tecnol<U+00F3>gica SA, in a binding deal that would create one of the world<U+2019>s largest wind-turbine manufacturers. Many investors initially were skeptical of Ms. Davis<U+2019> ability to manage these other energy units because her work experience solely was in the oil-and-gas industry. Moreover, Ms. Davis is the first management board member in Siemens<U+2019>s<U+00A0>169-year<U+00A0>history to run a major division from the U.S. <U+201C>There was tremendous doubt about her profile,<U+201D> said Ingo Speich, a portfolio manager at Union Investment, a Siemens shareholder. Operations have run <U+201C>smoothly<U+201D> under Ms. Davis, he said. <U+201C>Overall, we are more positive<U+201D> about her leadership capabilities. Andreas Willi, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, said stationing a senior executive in the U.S. made sense because Siemens<U+00A0>had been<U+00A0><U+201C>too Munich-focused<U+201D> before Chief Executive Joe Kaeser took over in 2013. Mr. Kaeser, who has presided over a major restructuring during the past few years, centralized control before recruiting Ms. Davis in 2014. Mr. Willi said that while Siemens <U+201C>historically wasn<U+2019>t an easy place for a woman, an outsider to succeed,<U+201D> if Mr. Kaeser <U+201C>gives her full support, it sends a pretty clear message<U+201D> to other staff. In an interview earlier this year, Mr. Kaeser said the oil-and-gas unit <U+201C>will be back stronger than ever<U+2026>and the way we help them survive is to help them to build a digital oil field,<U+201D> referencing Siemens<U+2019>s plans to apply its digital expertise to the sector. Ms. Davis said she brings a fresh perspective to a management board that can be too <U+201C>process oriented<U+201D> at the expense of results. <U+201C>We tend to use our incredible intelligence and capabilities in the company to make things too complex at times,<U+201D> she said. Now, the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president could offer the oil-and-gas industry <U+201C>a lot of tailwinds,<U+201D> said Union Investment<U+2019>s Mr. Speich. He cited Mr. Trump<U+2019>s proposals to lower corporate taxes and invest in infrastructure as potentially mitigating increased energy-market competition. Ms. Davis said Mr. Trump<U+2019>s pledges to improve ties between the West and Moscow could help Siemens re-engage in Russia, where it has done many deals in recent years. Siemens retrenched to comply with international sanctions<U+00A0>following Russian incursions in Ukraine in 2014. <U+201C>Russia is like other countries where infrastructure improvements are needed,<U+201D> Ms. Davis said. <U+201C>So if we can do that [build infrastructure] to support the needs in Russia in a fashion that is very respectful and compliant with the agreements between governments, then great.<U+201D> Write to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com",

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/opinion/sunday/the-dangers-of-donald-trump.html?_r=0 \n text: IN last Sunday<U+2019>s column, I wrote about the dangers that a Hillary Clinton presidency poses for the country. Since this is the final week for Hillary skeptics to agonize over whether to cast a vote for Donald Trump, it seems appropriate to outline why the risks of Trump are so distinctive as to throw the perils of a Clinton presidency into relative eclipse. This is a challenging thing to explain because Trump is, among recent American politicians, sui generis. The mistakes and blunders that an establishment liberal like Clinton is likely to make can be envisioned by looking at peers like Angela Merkel, at recent occupants of the White House, at Hillary<U+2019>s own record. But there are no obvious analogues for a President Trump; all the comparables, from Arnold Schwarzenegger to Silvio Berlusconi, only reflect part of what we would get with the Republican nominee as a superpower<U+2019>s president. So considering the dangers of Trump requires a grounded speculation, which is what I<U+2019>ll attempt here. These are not my worst-case scenarios: They do not involve Trump making baldly authoritarian moves or accidentally touching off nuclear war. Rather, they<U+2019>re three baseline dangers for a Trump administration, three perils that we would very likely face. The first is sustained market jitters, leading to an economic slump. Trump<U+2019>s election alone would probably induce a Brexit-esque stock market dip, but the real problem would be what happened next. Instead of Theresa May<U+2019>s steadiness inspiring a return to fundamentals, you would have the spectacle <U+2014> and it will be a spectacle <U+2014> of the same Trump team that drop-kicked its policy shop and barely organized a national campaign trying to staff up an administration. Even without his promised pivot to mercantilism and trade war, a White House run as a Trump production is likely to mainline anxiety into the economy, sidelining capital, discouraging hiring and shaving points off the G.D.P. The second peril is major civil unrest. Some of Trump<U+2019>s supporters imagine that his election would be a blow to left-wing activists, that his administration would swiftly reverse the post-Ferguson crime increase. This is a bit like imagining that a President George Wallace would have been good for late-1960s civil peace. In reality, Trump<U+2019>s election would be a gift to bad cops and riot-ready radicals in equal measure, and his every intervention would pour gasoline on campuses and cities <U+2014> not least because as soon as any protest movement had a face or leader, Trump would be on cable bellowing ad hominems at them. The third likely highly-plausible peril, and by far the most serious, is a rapid escalation of risk in every geopolitical theater. It<U+2019>s probably true that Trump, given his pro-Russia line, would be somewhat less likely than Clinton to immediately stumble into confrontation with Vladimir Putin over Syria. But it<U+2019>s silly to imagine Moscow slipping into a comfortable d<U+00E9>tente with a President Trump; Putin is more likely to pocket concessions and keep pushing, testing the orange-haired dealmaker at every opportunity and leaving Trump poised, very dangerously, between overreaction and his least-favorite position <U+2014> looking weak. That<U+2019>s just Russia: From the Pacific Rim to the Middle East, revisionist powers will set out to test Trump<U+2019>s capacity to handle surprise, hostile actors will seek to exploit the undoubted chaos of his White House, and our allies will build American fecklessness into their strategic plans. And again, all of this is likely to happen without Trump doing the wilder things he<U+2019>s kind-of sort-of pledged to do <U+2014> demanding tribute from allies, trying to <U+201C>take the oil,<U+201D> etc. He need only be himself in order to bring an extended period of risk upon the world. The history of geopolitics prior to the Pax Americana is rife with examples of why this sort of testing should be feared. Overall, Trump<U+2019>s foreign policy hazing, his rough introduction to machtpolitik, promises more danger for global stability <U+2014> still a real and valuable thing, recent crises notwithstanding <U+2014> than the risks incurred by George W. Bush<U+2019>s interventionism, Barack Obama<U+2019>s attempt at offshore balancing, or (yes) Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s possible exposure of classified material to the Chinese, the Russians and Anthony Weiner<U+2019>s sexting partners. There is no algorithm that can precisely calibrate how to weigh global instability against the reasons that remain for conservatives to vote for Trump. No mathematical proof can demonstrate that the chance of a solidly-conservative Supreme Court justice isn<U+2019>t worth a scaled-up risk of great power conflict. But I think that reluctant Trump supporters are overestimating the systemic durability of the American-led order, and underestimating the extent to which a basic level of presidential competence and self-control is itself a matter of life and death <U+2014> for Americans, and for human beings the world over. I may be wrong. But none of my fears (and I have many) of what a Hillary Clinton presidency will bring are strong enough to make me want to run the risk of being proven right.

He even called the presidential debates <U+201C>rigged.<U+201D> \nNow, I guess his ego is so YUGE because he wants the election cancelled, and the presidency awarded to him without voting. \nHe said at a rally in Toledo, Ohio Thursday: <U+201C>And just thinking to myself right now, we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right? What are we even having it for? What are we having it for? <U+2018>Her policies are so bad. Boy, do we have a big difference.<U+201D> \nHe<U+2019>s against voter fraud, but he<U+2019>s OK with just yanking the election away from us? That is insane. That is not how a democratic election works, Trumpy. Taking the vote away from the people like that would make Trump our first dictator. \nTrump may have been trying to make a joke out of it, but with his talk of rigged elections, that comment is just plain scary. \nOn Thursday, Trump appeared on Bill O<U+2019> Reilly<U+2019>s show. When asked if the polls would be rigged on election day, Trump said he believes they will be. When asked about his trailing in the national polls, Trump said : <U+201C>I<U+2019>m winning in certain polls and then in other polls, the dirty polls we call them, I was losing by numbers that were ridiculous. I think we<U+2019>re winning, but Bill, you look at some of these polls it<U+2019>s absolutely ridiculous.<U+201D> \nJust last week, Trump<U+2019>s poor Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway was faced with the undesirable job of defending Trump<U+2019>s idiocy. After one of the other times he whined about the election being rigged, she said : <U+201C>His entire campaign is built about the little guy being the victim, the forgotten man and forgotten woman being the victim of the rigged corrupt system. Let<U+2019>s keep the focus there. That<U+2019>s who he<U+2019>s fighting for. I know so many in the media like to just dismiss the crowd sizes. Let me tell you something, you go out on the road with Donald Trump, this election doesn<U+2019>t feel over.<U+201D> \nWhen he refers to himself in the third person, it makes him sound even creepier. \nCheck out this clip   \nFeatured image via YouTube screenshot .

In even blunter terms: how can a crippled politico deliver the goods to the special interests who bet their cash and political capital on the politico<U+2019>s ability to deliver favors? Among the many ghosts of Watergate, one specter especially haunts Hillary: once the special interests and party stalwarts who defended you through every scandal and every cover-up<U+2013>month after month and year after year, on the promise that you would deliver the goods upon ascending to the presidency<U+2013>realize you are too damaged to deliver anything of value to anyone, why would they continue supporting you? Once a politico has to declare <U+201C>I am not a crook<U+201D> based on legalese rather than a moral foundation, that politico<U+2019>s ability to lead has vanished. Hillary and her supporters rely entirely on legalese parsing of wrong-doing rather than on a self-explanatory, basic moral foundation of right and wrong. Declaring <U+201C>I am not a crook<U+201D> because the wrongdoing escapes prosecution is the same as declaring <U+201C>I am above the law.<U+201D> If the foundation of one<U+2019>s ability to lead is a reliance on legal parsing and allies in the Department of Justice squashing investigations while handing out immunity like candy on Halloween, the political capital required to lead no longer exists. Ultimately, the President leads by moral suasion. Even the political act of delivering the goods to the special interests that funded your campaign and your wealth must be backed by the moral authority of personal integrity and a morally grounded appeal to the common good. A politician who has effectively zero personal integrity is only as viable as his/her ability to deliver favors to the few (i.e. special interests) over the objections of the many. A reliance on cold-blooded horse-trading only works if the leader has enough political capital to arm-twist everyone into granting favors to allies and special interests. But this political capital rests on moral suasion and support earned not by issuing promises but by leading the nation through thorny thickets to solutions that work for the many, not just the few. Once the ability to lead has been lost, special interests can forget about getting favors. And once they realize their politico is a liability rather than an asset, self-preservation requires abandoning the liability as quickly as possible. It<U+2019>s nothing personal, it<U+2019>s just business. Anyone who thinks Hillary has the personal integrity to build sufficient political capital to lead is delusional. Anyone who believes Hillary has the moral foundation to deliver the goods to the myriad special interests that have funded her campaign and her personal wealth is equally delusional. Are Goldman Sachs et al. delusional? If there is any lesson to be learned from the ghosts of Watergate, it is that the big-money support of a leader who has lost the ability to deliver the goods crumbles very quickly as the endgame unfolds.

But the AIDS work is carried out by CHAI (\"Clinton Health Access Initiative\"), a separate organization. \nCHAI freely admits there is an implicit agreement with the drug companies not to pressure them to lower domestic prices. Bill Clinton made comments that added pressure. CHAI receives a great amount of positive publicity for their AIDS work abroad, and the comments jeopardize that program. Here, CHAI admits it is in their interests for U.S. AIDS drug prices to remain high, so that they can continue getting credit for keeping them low abroad. \nBut CHAI is not content with simply fleecing American AIDS sufferers. Since CHAI doesn't want pressure on Pharma companies to linger, they propose to torpedo other AIDS advocacy groups by creating a smaller, watered-down domestic program with the Pharma companies before those other advocacy groups begin their assault in January. \nThe Clintons are only out for themselves. In comments on World AIDS day in the subsequent years of 2012 and 2013 , Bill says nothing whatsoever about domestic drug prices. If AIDS advocacy groups cannot trust the Clintons not to stab them in the back, how can the American people? \nAlso remember, the Clinton foundation only donates 5.6% of their earnings to charity , despite Hillary knowingly and blatantly lying to the American people by claiming they donated 90% at the last debate, but she is counting on you to not do research, and her mainstream media to not report it. \n19.

In 1981, he and friend Moshe Waldoks edited and annotated <U+201C>The Big Book of Jewish Humor,<U+201D> which contains 368 pages of humorous gems from the Marx Brothers, Philip Roth, Woody Allen and others, and remains in print. Nine years later, the duo followed it up with <U+201C>The Big Book of New American Humor,<U+201D> in which, Mr. Novak teases, <U+201C>only half the jokes are Jewish.<U+201D> Like aging baby boomers, the jokes in <U+201C>Die Laughing: Killer Jokes for Newly Old Folks,<U+201D> out Oct. 25 from Touchstone, are oldies but goodies. These classic story jokes, with their setups and punchlines, aren<U+2019>t told much anymore, but Mr. Novak says older generations seem to perpetually appreciate them. <U+201C>I got that with the Jewish humor book. Adults would say, <U+2018>I bought it for my parents,<U+2019> <U+201D> says Mr. Novak, whose own children include B.J. Novak , the actor (<U+201D>The Office<U+201D>) and author (<U+201D>The Book with No Pictures<U+201D>). <U+201C>One of the reasons I wanted to do this book was to keep the joke alive.<U+201D> The author has led a sort of double writing life, also ghostwriting memoirs for celebrities . <U+201C> Iacocca: An Autobiography ,<U+201D> which he wrote with then-Chrysler chief executive Lee Iacocca, was the No. 1 nonfiction book of both 1984 and 1985, ultimately selling around 2.7 million copies. <U+201C>My agent tried to negotiate a percentage of the royalties, and we were told it was not gonna happen,<U+201D> Mr. Novak says, still lamenting the loss a little. <U+201C>They said, <U+2018>We<U+2019>ll put your name on the cover.<U+2019> I wasn<U+2019>t sure I wanted that. It was still a little embarrassing to be a ghostwriter in 1984. No kid ever went to bed at night dreaming of becoming a ghostwriter.<U+201D> That success, though, helped make Mr. Novak the go-to ghost for a time. He penned the memoirs of Nancy Reagan, Magic Johnson, Oliver North and Tip O<U+2019>Neill, among others. But he says he turned down an offer to write Donald Trump <U+2019>s second book, <U+201C>Trump: Surviving at the Top<U+201D> (1990). <U+201C>I had a strong feeling he was not my kind of guy,<U+201D> Mr. Novak says. More recently, the author has been writing biographies for private, often wealthy individuals, who pay Mr. Novak to write books about themselves or a family member, and then print the memoirs<U+2014>never to see a bookstore shelf<U+2014>at their own expense. As he returned to humor, there was some worry that the title <U+201C>Die Laughing,<U+201D> which Mr. Novak<U+2019>s wife, Linda, thought up, might offend some people. At least one publisher was put off by it. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s this idea that older people are easily offended. In fact, it<U+2019>s younger people who are more easily offended,<U+201D> Mr. Novak says. <U+201C>Look at colleges<U+2014>you can<U+2019>t say a word anymore.<U+201D> <U+2018> There<U+2019>s this idea that older people are easily offended. In fact, it<U+2019>s younger people who are more easily offended. Look at colleges<U+2014>you can<U+2019>t say a word anymore. <U+2019> <U+201C>Die Laughing<U+201D> includes chapters on various realities of the golden years: long marriages, minds and bodies that don<U+2019>t always perform the way they used to, and even death and the afterlife. The book takes readers to lots of doctors<U+2019> offices, to heaven, to golf courses. In one joke, a woman asks her doctor for the good news before the bad. The doctor says, cheerily, <U+201C>We<U+2019>re naming a disease after you!<U+201D> In another, which Mr. Novak says can be traced back to ancient Greece, two geezers are sitting on a bench. One turns to the other and says: <U+201C>Remind me, was it you or your brother who died last winter?<U+201D> Memory issues have long been humor-friendly, and they<U+2019>re especially apt in a book for <U+201C>newly old folks.<U+201D> <U+201C>I read that for years people said their biggest aging concerns were heart disease and cancer,<U+201D> Mr. Novak says. <U+201C>Now it<U+2019>s Alzheimer<U+2019>s.<U+201D> <U+201C>Die Laughing<U+201D> brings a light touch to the subject. In one setup, a couple has guests over for dinner, and the husband is trying to remember the name of a restaurant he liked. He asks his guests to start naming flowers. <U+201C>Rose,<U+201D> one of them finally suggests. <U+201C>Thank you,<U+201D> the husband says, then yells to his wife in the kitchen: <U+201C>Rose! What<U+2019>s the name of that restaurant?<U+201D> The book also features cartoons, including about 20 from the New Yorker, like one by Roz Chast in which a man is skimming a newspaper<U+2019>s obituary page. The headlines read: <U+201C>Twelve Years Older Than You,<U+201D> <U+201C>Two Years Younger Than You,<U+201D> and so forth. At a certain age, we<U+2019>re ready to laugh at death, Mr. Novak says. <U+201C>Bad taste I<U+2019>m willing to do. Life is in bad taste. If you<U+2019>re easily offended, you shouldn<U+2019>t be reading any joke book,<U+201D> he says. <U+201C>I drew the line at terrible taste. There<U+2019>s very little toilet humor. One joke is about a new wine that will stop you from getting up to urinate. It<U+2019>s called Pinot More.<U+201D> Corrections & Amplifications: An earlier version of this article incorrectly called the book <U+201C>Die Laughing: Killer Jokes for Newly Old People.<U+201D>.",

McCaskill 10/03/16 02:16 PM EDT Updated 10/03/16 03:35 PM EDT Hillary Clinton forcefully <U+2014> and joyfully <U+2014> hammered Donald Trump over his business acumen Monday, casting the real estate mogul as a bigger bully than Wells Fargo rather than the <U+201C>genius<U+201D> his allies have sought to portray him as. Clinton was noticeably jubilant as she kicked off an afternoon rally in Toledo, Ohio, after what was perhaps the worst week of her rival<U+2019>s campaign. Story Continued Below <U+201C>Y<U+2019>all see the debate last Monday?<U+201D> Clinton asked supporters, who were fired up by her reference to the Hofstra University debate. <U+201C>Well, in the debate <U+2014> in the debate,<U+201D> she began, pausing as she smiled and took in the <U+201C>Hillary! Hillary!<U+201D> chants from the crowd. <U+201C>Well, then you all know that in the debate he said it was smart to avoid paying taxes. Yesterday, his campaign was bragging it makes him a genius,<U+201D> she continued. <U+201C>Here<U+2019>s my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year? This is Trump to a T. He<U+2019>s taken corporate excess and made a business model out of it. He abuses his power, games the system, puts his own interests ahead of the country<U+2019>s. It<U+2019>s Trump first and everyone else last.<U+201D> Clinton repeatedly seized on the bombshell New York Times report that revealed that the real estate mogul lost $916 million, according to portions of his 1995 tax returns, which may have allowed him to avoid paying personal income taxes for up to 18 years. By Louis Nelson Trump<U+2019>s allies, meanwhile, have touted the Republican presidential nominee<U+2019>s <U+201C>genius<U+201D> for using a nearly $1 billion loss to possibly avoid paying personal income taxes for nearly two decades. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended Trump on Sunday, with Giuliani telling ABC<U+2019>s George Stephanopoulos: <U+201C>My response is he<U+2019>s a genius. Absolute genius.<U+201D> Clinton highlighted Wells Fargo as just one example of the <U+201C>egregious corporate behavior<U+201D> America has seen <U+2014> but suggested that even with the fraud scandal hanging over its head, it<U+2019>s got nothing on Trump, whom she called the <U+201C>poster boy<U+201D> of <U+201C>bullying small businesses.<U+201D> <U+201C>Look at Wells Fargo. Really shocking, isn<U+2019>t it?<U+201D> Clinton said. <U+201C>One of the nation<U+2019>s biggest banks, bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers, secretly opening up millions of accounts for people without their consent, even their knowledge, misusing personal information and then sticking customers with hidden fees. It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy, we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law. And then in a category by himself, there<U+2019>s Donald Trump.<U+201D> Clinton ripped Trump for his refusal to release his tax returns (Trump has maintained that he won<U+2019>t release them while he<U+2019>s under an IRS audit), telling supporters there should be a law mandating that major party presidential nominees release their returns. <U+201C>A lot of us were wondering: What is he hiding? It must be really terrible,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>Well, The New York Times has discovered at least part of the answer: Back in the 1990s, Trump apparently lost a billion dollars in a single year on bad investments and failing casinos. Now, how anybody can lose a dollar, let alone a billion dollars, in the casino industry is kinda beyond me, right? It<U+2019>s just hard to figure.<U+201D> By Marc Caputo <U+201C>But as a result,<U+201D> she continued, <U+201C>it doesn't look like he paid a dime of federal income tax for almost two decades. Now, while millions of American families, including mine and yours, were working hard, paying our fair share, it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation. Imagine that. Not fair. Nothing for Pell grants to help kids go to college. Nothing for veterans. Nothing for our military.<U+201D> Clinton also sought to undercut the self-proclaimed billionaire<U+2019>s allegation that the system is rigged and only he can fix it, likening that scenario to <U+201C>letting the fox guard the henhouse.<U+201D> Trump, she said, <U+201C>represents the same rigged system that he claims he<U+2019>s gonna change.<U+201D> <U+201C>After he made all those bad bets and lost all that money, he didn<U+2019>t lift a finger to help and protect his employees or all the small businesses and contractors he hired or the people of Atlantic City,<U+201D> Clinton said. <U+201C>They all got hammered while he was busy with his accountants trying to figure out how he could keep living like a billionaire. And all the while he was using his political connections to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in government subsidies and extra tax breaks for his companies. In other words, Trump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill.<U+201D> But she didn<U+2019>t stop there. She went on to say she was stunned by <U+2014> <U+201C>I get stunned every day in this campaign, but here<U+2019>s one of the many things that I<U+2019>m stunned by<U+201D> <U+2014> a tax plan Trump has proposed that Clinton said would cut his taxes even more. <U+201C>It would be like <U+2014> you<U+2019>re paying zero,<U+201D> Clinton said. <U+201C>You expect us to pay you to stay in business?

And while one can only imagine the content of some of the more persona ones, the WSJ writes that the latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe, the bureau<U+2019>s second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a minor, they had recovered a laptop with 650,000 emails. Many, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter.\n** One-Third of likely voters are less likely to vote for Hillary Clinton following the announcement of a new FBI criminal investigation.\nDemocrats are going psycho right now as they are in full panic mode.

If I need something, he<U+2019>s the guy I call. A good father, a good husband. He<U+2019>s got a Ph.D. and is a well-respected college professor. That I also believe he<U+2019>s a racist, misogynist, homophobic lunatic, I<U+2019>ll get to in a moment, because I first want to make very clear that I love him like a brother. In high school my friend and I ran track together and because I was slow, he<U+2019>d wait up for me, jogging in place at the top of each hill. And on those long runs we<U+2019>d talk about philosophy and our own <U+201C>puny existences.<U+201D> That<U+2019>s the sort of guys we were. Lucky to have each other because our teammates thought we were freaks. Today we live far apart, and mostly communicate by email. Lately I spend much of life, when I should be working or paying attention to my daughter, sending my friend screeds. And when I<U+2019>m not writing them on the screen, I<U+2019>m writing them in my head. I am <U+2014> and I<U+2019>m not proud of this <U+2014> completely obsessed with my friend<U+2019>s position in this election. My friend is an evangelical Christian and is, reluctantly, even now, supporting Donald J. Trump. He believes that Mr. Trump represents the lesser of two evils. He recently sent me an article from The Wall Street Journal arguing that Christians must do their duty and commit themselves to the difficult task of voting for Mr. Trump in the spirit of Dietrich Bonhoeffer who, accused of having supported the bomb plot to kill Hitler, was executed by the Nazis. Because sometimes the greater good requires, etc., etc., etc. My unhinged response read, in part: <U+201C>Bonhoeffer<U+2019>s courage is the same COURAGE as voting for Trump??? I expected more from you, a lot more. The only saving grace is that millions of Christians aren<U+2019>t buying it. I<U+2019>ll pray for you, my friend. And one day when you have to explain to your kids how you, as a Christian, but more important as a human being, could have supported this ticket, I<U+2019>ll tell them that you truly believed you were helping save the country from a monster enabler of sexual predators and rapists of 12-year-olds <U+2014> you had no choice. The all-white echo chamber where you received your information had so distorted your ability to see that you were temporarily blinded from reason.<U+201D> My friend responded, as he always does, mildly, asking me to please watch my language. Can<U+2019>t we discuss these issues without resorting to vitriol? <U+201C>I love how this election has turned you into a moralist,<U+201D> he wrote. <U+201C>You<U+2019>re like an even more miniature Tim Kaine. My son (who was reading over my shoulder) asked me to tell you to <U+2018>give Donald Trump credit for being a human being.<U+2019> Once again, instead of seriously engaging with the issues at hand, you sling out insults. It<U+2019>s a very cogent article, one you are free to disagree with. But this isn<U+2019>t engagement. You are not addressing the very legitimate concerns about Hillary. That is problematic. Happy birthday by the way.<U+201D> As furious as I get, deep down, I don<U+2019>t actually doubt his sincerity when he tells me, mildly, always mildly, about Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s <U+201C>atrocities.<U+201D> Thinking about my friend makes me also think of my father. If my friend is the definition of a reluctant Trump supporter, my father, had he lived to enjoy this carnival, would have been the candidate<U+2019>s poster child. I have it on good authority (my mother) that my father wept for hours on the night Bobby Kennedy was killed in 1968. In the <U+2019>70s and early <U+2019>80s, he was an active member of the finance council of the Democratic National Committee. But by the <U+2019>90s he had come to embrace a shouting Fox News worldview of anti-immigrant and misogynist fervor, and he railed against what he called my hopeless political correctness. The story of my father<U+2019>s conversion is complicated, but if there was one event that led to his nursing his grievances, it is that in the early 1990s, he was sued for sexual harassment by one of his former employees. Though the case was settled out of court and my father was never in jeopardy of losing his law license, he stepped down from something called the Character and Fitness Committee of the Illinois State Bar Association. You might laugh at this, but it<U+2019>s a real thing, and my father was especially proud of his service on this committee that measures a would-be lawyer<U+2019>s moral fiber. He felt misunderstood, maligned. Did he do it? He always said the allegations were patently untrue, but few people believed him. By the time of the Obama administration, he had begun referring to the president with a Yiddish term I won<U+2019>t repeat here (not, Dad, out of political correctness, but because it revolts me to this day and I can still hear you saying it in my ears). What he often had to say about women, especially my mother, who had left him, I won<U+2019>t include here, either. But when I heard the Access Hollywood tape of Mr. Trump, I called my brother and asked him who the guy on the tape sounded like. <U+201C>You gotta ask?<U+201D> But he was my father; I loved him. When he died a few years ago, I happened to be staying with my old friend when I received the news. That weekend we ran together and talked. <U+201C>Didn<U+2019>t he teach you how to play chess?<U+201D> my friend asked. <U+201C>Who introduced you to Dickens?<U+201D> He helped me remember that, behind the anger, my father was still, and always, my father. I can<U+2019>t expunge him from the record, my record. And to be honest it now brings me a warped kind of joy to think of what a kick he<U+2019>d have gotten out of this last (ineffectual) roar of men of a certain age. In 2014 my friend<U+2019>s father died as well. We commiserated over email, about however much you think you<U+2019>re ready for it, nothing prepares you for the void fathers leave behind. In a bit I will send a message to my friend to say he<U+2019>s a revolting Neanderthal, that I<U+2019>m not kidding, that I believe he<U+2019>s a danger to himself, his students, the Republic itself. I<U+2019>ll also say hey to Diane and the boys. That new school working out? How comforting our most deeply held political convictions are, in contrast to our love, which, though inexplicable, is somehow always <U+2014> to use one my friend<U+2019>s favorite words <U+2014> merciful.

SCHWARTZ \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/business/economy/trump-saved-jobs-at-carrier-but-more-midwest-jobs-are-in-jeopardy.html?_r=0 \n text: In tiny Sellersburg, Ind., just across the border from Kentucky, Manitowoc Foodservice is in the final stages of closing a factory that makes beverage dispensers and ice machines and is laying off 84 workers. The company is moving production to Mexico. Just 100 miles away, President-elect Donald J. Trump will appear on Thursday with workers at Carrier<U+2019>s Indianapolis plant to boast of his success in saving at least 1,000 jobs from moving to Mexico. The truth across the Rust Belt is that there are more Manitowoc Foodservices than Carriers. The layoffs and closing in Sellersburg follow similar shutdowns by Manitowoc in Ohio and Wisconsin. <U+201C>I<U+2019>ll give Trump his due, but I hope he and the American people and Congress don<U+2019>t forget about all these other jobs going to Mexico,<U+201D> said Chuck Jones, the president of Local 1999 of the United Steelworkers in Indianapolis, which represents Carrier. <U+201C>Down the pike, a lot more are going to be moving out.<U+201D> Indeed, Rexnord, the ball bearing factory in Indianapolis where Mr. Jones went to work straight out of high school nearly 40 years ago, said in October it would be moving to Mexico. It is just a mile from the Carrier plant. The mayor of Indianapolis, Joe Hogsett, and Senator Joe Donnelly, both Democrats, tried to exert Trumplike pressure to force Rexnord to rethink its plans, but so far the company has not shown any sign it will change course. <U+201C>On a personal level at Carrier, it is huge,<U+201D> said Jerry N. Conover, director of the Indiana Business Research Center at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. <U+201C>But by itself, the disappearance or retention of 1,000 jobs is a small slice of the total economy in Indiana.<U+201D> <U+201C>I think there will be continued downward pressure on employment in factories because of trends toward automation especially and moving to lower-cost areas for production,<U+201D> he added. Carrier, in its official statement on the deal on Wednesday, said that it thought the agreement it negotiated with Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence <U+201C>benefits our workers, the state of Indiana and our company.<U+201D> But it said that incentives provided by Indiana, where Mr. Pence is governor, <U+201C>were an important consideration.<U+201D> It added that <U+201C>the forces of globalization will continue to require solutions for the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. and American workers.<U+201D> Those 1,000 Carrier jobs saved represent just 0.2 percent of total manufacturing employment in the state. And despite a rebound since the aftermath of the Great Recession, at just over half a million positions, factory employment in Indiana this year is still down by more than 20 percent since 2000. The good news is that Indiana has been doing well economically, with an unemployment rate below the national average and steady gains in employment like food service, retail and logistics. But those service jobs pay well below the $20 to $25 an hour that veteran Carrier employees <U+2014> with only a high school diploma <U+2014> can earn building furnaces and fan coils in Indianapolis. The typical manufacturing worker in the state earns $59,000 a year, about $20,000 a year more than the typical service job. And for less credentialed workers, that margin is the difference between having a shot at a middle-class life, including owning a home and sending children to college, and having to struggle to make ends meet. <U+201C>These are truly irreplaceable jobs,<U+201D> said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an advocacy group, and a native of Rensselaer, Ind. <U+201C>A manufacturing job is one of the only ladders to fulfilling the American dream for a worker without a college degree.<U+201D> <U+201C>A manufacturing worker who loses their job at Carrier will be resigned to facing a lower standard of living and leaner retirement years,<U+201D> Mr. Paul added. <U+201C>Carrier is special because it happened at the right time and the right place and it gained a high profile. But obviously, Donald Trump and Mike Pence can<U+2019>t intervene every time a plant closes.<U+201D> The economic fortunes for this group have been shrinking for years, which is a major reason the story of Mr. Trump and Carrier has resonated so deeply. In Indiana, in particular, as in other so-called Rust Belt states, there are a lot of people who are less educated : Just 16.5 percent of the state<U+2019>s residents ages 25 to 64 have a bachelor<U+2019>s degree, half the rate for the country over all. And while about 30 percent have an associate degree or some college, the bulk of Indiana residents, 44 percent, have only a high school diploma <U+2014> or less. Nor has manufacturing remained the sole domain of whites. It provides a crucial source of higher-paying jobs for minorities. In the popular imagination, the Indianapolis factory where 1,400 Carrier workers build furnaces and fan coils looks like a scene out of <U+201C>The Deer Hunter<U+201D> or <U+201C>Norma Rae.<U+201D> Blue-collar guys walking through the plant gate, lunch pail in hand, or white women barely getting by after years on the line. But the reality at the Carrier plant that Mr. Trump will visit on Thursday is very different. About half the workers are African-American, making it a much more diverse workplace than many white-collar settings. Women account for a substantial portion of the work force as well, but the wages are anything but subsistence: over $20 an hour plus benefits for workers with just a high school diploma. That is an almost unheard-of level of pay for Indiana workers with that level of education in other sectors like food service and retail or even many health care jobs. Carol Bigbee, 59, who has worked at Carrier for over 13 years, earns $22 an hour. Her daughter has a bachelor<U+2019>s degree and works in a medical lab, but earns one-third less. <U+201C>You have to be really blessed to find a job that pays that kind of money,<U+201D> she said. In southern Indiana, where the Manitowoc Foodservice factory will close next year, good-paying blue-collar jobs are just as rare. But Rich Sheffer, vice president for investor relations and treasurer at the company, said it had little choice but to relocate to Mexico. <U+201C>This company has 20 percent excess manufacturing capacity,<U+201D> he said. A few of the jobs are being transferred to Covington, Tenn., he said, but the Sellersburg plant <U+201C>would have required a massive investment in automation. And we have to deal with profit margins that are trailing the industry.<U+201D> Mr. Sheffer said his company<U+2019>s situation was different from that of Carrier, which has profitable operations in Indiana but could make more money in Mexico. <U+201C>Our motivation is completely different, but,<U+201D> he added, <U+201C>we haven<U+2019>t been contacted by anybody in the Trump administration.<U+201D> Correction: December 3, 2016 A picture caption on Thursday with the continuation of an article about manufacturing jobs in the Midwest misstated in some editions the relationship between the women pictured. Arnita Gray and Carol Bigbee are co-workers at Carrier in Indiana; Ms. Gray is not Ms. Bigbee<U+2019>s daughter.

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: opednews.com \n text: License DMCA \nThere is a recurring concern in discussions about the economy that technology threatens the livelihood of large segments of the workforce. The exact mechanism varies. In one version, the robots will take all the jobs, leading to a massive surge in unemployment. A somewhat different version has the development of technology benefiting people with college and advanced degrees to the detriment of those with less education. In this story, the highly educated do well, while the less educated see stagnant or declining wages. \nWhile the future may actually be one of continually rising inequality, it is important to realize that technology is not the culprit. It is not the technology that determines who gets the benefits of major innovations; it is laws that govern technology, which in turn are made by politicians. Specifically, the laws on patents and intellectual property more generally will determine whether advances in technology are associated with increasing inequality or broadly shared prosperity. \nStarting with the robot story, we are supposed to be concerned that robots will replace workers in factories and warehouses. Robots can do the job better and cheaper. We will also have self-driving cars, trucks and buses. This will displace millions of additional workers and radically reduce the demand for cars. (We can summon a car to take us from point A to point B when we need it. There is no reason to have a car rusting in front of our house.) \nThat's the displacement story, but suppose that robots are extremely cheap. There is no obvious reason they shouldn't be cheap. After all, we probably won't need any rare materials to make robots. And presumably robots could be mostly manufactured by other robots, so the labor involved wouldn't be expensive. In this case, we should be able to buy a robot at our local hardware store or from our favorite internet retailer for a few hundred dollars. - Advertisement - \nOnce we buy the robot, we can have it clean our house, cook our food, mow our lawn and do all sorts of other tasks that we may not want to do ourselves. We can probably even save on our food budget by having the robot plant and tend a vegetable garden. If robots are doing all this work for us and we no longer need to buy and maintain a car to meet our transportation needs, we should all have a high standard of living. \nBut suppose that patents and related protections keep the price of robots high. And instead of technology driving down the cost of transportation with self-driving cars to almost nothing, patent monopolies allow the top executives and shareholders of Uber or its equivalent to get very rich at the expense of the rest of the population. In that scenario, most people may not benefit to any great extent from technology. In that case, robots may take our jobs, but instead of the benefits from productivity growth being passed along in higher wages and lower prices, as was true in past decades, the benefits go to minority of well-situated individuals. \nTo some extent we have already seen this story as Congress has repeatedly acted to make patent and related protections stronger and longer. In the longer category, copyright protection has been extended from 55 years to 95 years. Patent protection has been extended from 14 years from the date of issuance to 20 years from the date of application, with a wide variety of conditions allowing for further extensions. Patent protection was also extended to new areas so that it now applies to life forms, software and business methods. \nThe impact of these stronger protections is most visible in the area of prescription drugs. We will spend over $430 billion in 2016 (2.3 percent of GDP) on drugs that would likely sell for 10 to 20 percent of this amount in a free market. In addition to patent protection, drug manufacturers can also now enjoy data exclusivity for test data and a wide variety of other protections that act to prevent generic competition. \nThe problem associated with excessive protection of intellectual property is vividly illustrated with the Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. This drug has a list price in the United States of $84,000 for a three-month course of treatment. A high-quality generic version is available in India for $200. Insurers and governments have struggled to come up with the money to pay for Sovaldi and, in many cases, have sought to deny treatment to patients. If Sovaldi could be purchased at its generic price, the cost of treatment would be a non-issue for those with Hepatitis C. - Advertisement - \nThose who developed and marketed Sovaldi are now getting very rich as a result of its high price. But this is not a story of technology making them rich; it is a story of government-granted patent monopolies making them rich. \nIf we are bothered by the upward redistribution of income of the last four decades, we should be looking at how we support the process of innovation, not blaming robots. \nOf course we do need a mechanism to support research, innovation and creative work. But there is little evidence that the lengthening and strengthening of intellectual property protection in the last four decades has led to a faster pace of innovation. Furthermore, there are other mechanisms for financing research. We spend over $30 billion a year supporting biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health. This mostly supports basic research, but there is no reason that the funding could not be expanded with additional funds devoted explicitly to the developing and testing of new drugs. \nMost importantly, we have to understand that the incomes that people earn as a result of intellectual property protections are due to government policy. They are not the result of technology. If we are bothered by the upward redistribution of income of the last four decades, we should be looking at how we support the process of innovation, not blaming robots.",

White women overall voted for Donald Trump by a decisive margin, and white women without college degrees broke even more heavily for the Republican nominee, according to exit polls. Among women overall, Mrs. Clinton won a slightly smaller share of the female electorate than Barack Obama did in 2012 and 2008. Democrats hoped that emphasizing Mr. Trump<U+2019>s history of lewd remarks about women and allegations of sexual assault against the candidate would prompt female voters to turn against him. Yet the spread between how men and women voted this week<U+2014>with 54% of women backing Mrs. Clinton and 42% backing Mr. Trump<U+2014>was only slightly wider than the gap in 2012 when Mr. Obama and Mitt Romney split female voters 55% and 44%, respectively. Trump voters across genders signaled they punched their ticket for the candidate despite having misgivings about his treatment of women. Almost three in 10 people who said his treatment of women bothered them voted for him anyway. <U+201C>People were willing to overlook things that they didn<U+2019>t like about him,<U+201D> said Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg. After downplaying her gender when she first ran for president in 2008, Mrs. Clinton embraced being the first female presidential nominee of a major political party throughout this year<U+2019>s campaign. Clinton T-shirts and placards boasted <U+201C>I<U+2019>m With Her,<U+201D> and her campaign rented a Manhattan convention center with an actual glass ceiling for what they hoped would be an election-night victory party. VIEW Interactive Yet in interviews, some women said that electing the first female president wasn<U+2019>t a reason to back the Mrs. Clinton. They cited misgivings about her use of a private email server while secretary of state, the fact they didn<U+2019>t trust her or that they disagreed with her policies to expand government aid, such as her plan for free tuition for certain colleges. <U+201C>There isn<U+2019>t a great deal of evidence that either her positions on issues or her candidacy as a woman [moved] the numbers very much,<U+201D> said Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington. Despite that, Mrs. Clinton notched some accomplishments with female voters that have long eluded her party. She won 49% of married women while Mr. Trump took 47% of them, making her the first Democrat to clinch that group since her husband, Bill Clinton, defeated Bob Dole in 1996. Married women may have been more likely than other female voters to part ways with Mr. Trump on account of his temperament and demeanor, though their exact motivations are unclear, Ms. Bowman said. They include women like Kathleen Phillips, a 58-year-old Lafayette, Ind., wife and mother, who voted Republican for president in most elections ever since she cast a ballot for Gerald R. Ford in 1976. She said she was so turned off by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s crude remarks that she voted for Mrs. Clinton this year. <U+00A0><U+201C>She has poise and confidence,<U+201D> Ms. Phillips said. Mrs. Clinton also received hefty support from minority women, winning 94% of black female voters and 68% of Latino women. But she lost white women overall to Mr. Trump, taking 43% of those voters while the Republican nominee got 53% of them. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s success with blue-collar voters helps explain part of that. Among white women without college degrees, Mr. Trump won 62% of the vote while Mrs. Clinton took 34%, an even wider gap than when Mr. Obama lost the group to Mr. Romney four years ago. By contrast, Mrs. Clinton won white female college graduates, getting 51% of those voters while Mr. Trump won 45% of them. Mr. Romney took the group in 2012. <U+201C>There are women, especially older blue-collar women, who are skeptical about women<U+2019>s political leadership,<U+201D> Ms. Greenberg said. <U+201C>We still live in a sexist country.<U+201D> <U+2014>Paul Overberg contributed to this article.

The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, was recently up 0.2% to 89.61, its highest closing since March. Investors have driven the dollar to eight-month highs this week amid optimism that fiscal spending and tax cuts under a Trump administration will spur economic growth, higher inflation and lighter regulation. Expectations for higher U.S. interest rates have also climbed, as investors bet resurgent growth will allow the Federal Reserve to tighten borrowing costs. Fed-funds futures, a tool traders use to place bets on central-bank policy, show an 81% chance of an interest-rate increase next month, up from 71.5% on Thursday, according to CME Group data. The dollar<U+2019>s strength is pressuring emerging-market currencies and bonds. As U.S. interest-rates rise, emerging markets become less attractive to yield-seeking investors. The dollar was up 0.7% against the Mexican peso and 0.3% against the Taiwan dollar.

DUNLAP \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/nyregion/trump-wanted-his-name-across-the-earth-new-york-city-said-no.html?_r=0 \n text: There is at least one conspicuous object owned by Donald J. Trump in New York City that never carried his name. The enormous silvery globe at the Trump International Hotel and Tower on Columbus Circle in Manhattan <U+2014> a homage to the Unisphere in Mr. Trump<U+2019>s home borough of Queens <U+2014> was originally intended to be girdled by the words <U+201C>Trump International,<U+201D> in letters about three feet high. Instead, the 30-foot-wide sculpture simply shows the world<U+2019>s land masses silhouetted on a spherical framework of latitudinal and longitudinal struts. Like the original 120-foot Unisphere , built for the 1964-65 World<U+2019>s Fair, the Trump globe is encircled by three orbital rings. As such, it is an aesthetic understatement in the Trump canon. But the understatement, it turns out, was enforced. A 20-year-old City Planning Department memorandum, provided this month to The New York Times, shows that agency officials viewed any lettering on the globe as illegal. The case has newfound relevance with the Trump brand seemingly under fire or in retreat in some quarters. Before 1996, Mr. Trump had put his name on just about anything he wanted. When it came to Columbus Circle, however, officials in the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is currently an ardent supporter of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s presidential candidacy on the Republican ticket, all but said: Enough is enough. <U+201C>There is no question that the globe with lettering is a sign and is not a permitted obstruction,<U+201D> Richard Barth and Douglas Woodward wrote to the director and the executive director of the City Planning Department on Oct. 23, 1996. At the time, Mr. Barth was the director of the department<U+2019>s Manhattan planning office. Mr. Woodward was an urban designer responsible for the many redevelopment projects occurring around Columbus Circle, including the redesign of the circle itself. They had just met with Charles Reiss, a senior vice president of the Trump Organization, who tried to persuade them that a Trump-branded globe would fall within the definition of <U+201C>ornamental fountains or statuary,<U+201D> which are permitted by law to obstruct some views at public plazas. Mr. Barth and Mr. Woodward were not buying it <U+2014> any of it. <U+201C>Setting aside the issue of whether the globe is a permitted obstruction,<U+201D> they wrote, <U+201C>we believe that the scale of the globe is so enormous, it would detract from the overall streetscape plan we are designing for the circle.<U+201D> In the end, the only words on the globe were <U+201C>Brandell Miami,<U+201D> on a small plaque mounted on the cylindrical base. Kim Brandell was the sculptor and designer. He had earlier crafted a globe for the short-lived Trump World<U+2019>s Fair casino in Atlantic City. That mini-Unisphere carried Mr. Trump<U+2019>s name prominently <U+2014> looking like the Universal Pictures logo of the 1930s and <U+2019>40s. Neither Brandell Studios nor the Trump Organization responded on Tuesday to requests by email for comment. So it was left to Jerold S. Kayden , the founder and president of Advocates for Privately Owned Public Space , to sum up the case: <U+201C>Slapping one<U+2019>s name on a work of art doesn<U+2019>t make the name part of the artwork.<U+201D> A version of this article appears in print on October 26, 2016, on Page A25 of the New York edition with the headline: Trump Wanted to Put His Name Across the Earth.

That used to be, with several nations having such claims. \nBut the US is struggling to keep those nations exclusively buying US arms. Today<U+2019>s big loss was from Malaysia , which has announced they intend to buy littoral mission ships from China, instead of the United States. Details on the decision-making process are unclear, but the US problems with their own littoral combat ships breaking down, so that might<U+2019>ve hurt their chances. \nIt<U+2019>s a comparatively small deal, but part of a growing trend. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has been making headlines for weeks with his interest in ending long-standing reliance on the US. While this has grown into complaints about general US-Philippines relations, one of the early grievances was his not liking the US dictating arms sales, and expressing interest in buying from China and Russia instead. \nIf these countries start buying their arms from China, they<U+2019>ll have a strong incentive to resolve maritime disputes with China diplomatically, which could severely limit their interest in having warships patrolling through the area to <U+201C>confront<U+201D> China.

In reply to Republican complaints earlier this month, Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cort<U+00E9>s acknowledged officials are preparing for all contingencies, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. \nBut George said the provisional ballot printing doesn<U+2019>t make sense even for contingencies. And it doesn<U+2019>t compare to demand in 2012. \n<U+201C>The claim that it is for contingency planning is bogus,<U+201D> George said in an email. <U+201C>In 2012, Stafford County used less [sic] than 500 provisional ballots <U+2014> in 2016 they received 30,000. In 2012, Loudoun County used 700 provisional ballots. In 2016, they received 84,000. In 2012, Fairfax used 2,500 provisional ballots; in 2016, they received over 265,000. This is ridiculous.<U+201D> \nBut spokeswoman Dena Potter of the Virginia Department of Elections said the state is trying to accommodate a court order. \n<U+201C>As part of its emergency preparedness efforts and in response to the [December] 2015 consent decree related to mitigating long lines at the polls, the Department issued guidance to local registrars on August 29, 2016, that included having enough provisional ballot envelopes to equal at least 20 percent of the number of active voters as of September 1,<U+201D> Potter said in an email. <U+201C>As of September 30, there were 5.5 million voters registered in Virginia. As with any contingency planning, we hope that we don<U+2019>t have to use these but they will be available in case we do.<U+201D> \nThe decision to print so many provisional ballots comes after an April announcement by Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat and a key ally of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. McAuliffe said he would allow more than 200,000 released felons to vote on Nov. 8. \nThe decision immediately brought a legal challenge from the Republicans, who won their suit in July. Virginia law says the governor must individually clear such cases, and cannot widely add so many released felons back to the voter rolls. \nGeorge believes the court loss is part of the thinking behind the surge in provisional ballots. The thousands of felons who signed up to vote after McAuliffe<U+2019>s order were initially welcomed to the voter rolls. George said left-wing voter groups were ready for the order, and signed up thousands of felons within hours. \nIf those felons now walk into a polling place and demand a ballot, they will be accommodated, George charged. George also said he is concerned other ineligible voters will be handed such provisional ballots simply if they demand them. \nProvisional ballots are only counted by city and county election boards after Nov. 8, and Republicans should be prepared for things to go against them, George said. Each board has a Republican and a Democrat, and a McAuliffe appointee. \n<U+201C>Guess which way the vote is going to go,<U+201D> said George. \nVirginia leaders have been dealing with election headaches for months. On Oct. 13, Virginia legislators questioned Cort<U+00E9>s at a hearing. One Republican leader, citing election problems, called for Cort<U+00E9>s to resign, according to the Times-Dispatch. \n<U+201C>I think it<U+2019>s incumbent upon the governor to replace you quickly with competent and nonpartisan leadership,<U+201D> said Delegate Timothy Hugo (R-Fairfax).

Severe Allergies to Peanuts, Eggs and Dairy Directly Linked to Ingredients in Common Vaccines Have you read The Peanut Allergy Epidemic by historian Heather Fraser? She begins by asking us wh... http://humansarefree.com/2016/10/severe-allergies-to-peanuts-eggs-and.html Have you read The Peanut Allergy Epidemic by historian Heather Fraser? She begins by asking us why the peanut allergy epidemic is only found in Western cultures, where at least 4 million people experience the mysterious phenomenon, yet there are virtually no reported cases in India, where peanuts just so happen to be the main ingredient in most baby food products. Consider this: one century ago, you couldn't find anyone allergic to peanuts, but now it's commonplace for parents to send EpiPens to school for the teacher and nurse to keep near to their children, just in case someone so much as opens a snack in the room that contains peanuts, or even if someone opens a food product that was so much as manufactured in \"a facility that processes peanuts.\" What's wrong with the human body that it would go into anaphylactic shock from a seemingly harmless food ingredient that couldn't harm a soul a hundred years ago? Today, peanuts cause the most common severe food allergy reactions , and are the number one cause of death from food reactions, and for good reason: Peanut oil was never meant to be put in a syringe and injected into muscle tissue. Peanut oil is a non-stated, hidden ingredient in children's vaccines Back in 2010, one family had their 6-month-old child taken away from them and were accused in court of shaken baby syndrome, until their attorney presented corroborating medical information about the child's anaphylactic reaction and swelling around the baby boy's brain (subdural hemorrhages) that occurred as an immediate response to vaccinations . Which vaccines were those, you may be wondering? DTaP, Prevnar7 (pneumococcal) and Rotateq (Rotavirus vaccine). Guess what? The administered vaccines contained unlabeled peanut oil, which was used as an adjuvant, but was not listed on the vaccine inserts. The doctor basically proved to the court that the child's allergic reaction to having peanut oil injected by vaccine had caused the massive brain swelling reaction that sent the boy into shock. False medical theory: The stronger the allergic reaction to vaccine ingredients, the longer the immunity lasts In the mid-1960s, peanut oils were first introduced into vaccines because scientists hypothesized they could \"prolong\" immunity. Somehow, they thought, the oil would act as a time release capsule. Within 20 years, peanut oil was the preferred \"excipient\" <U+2013> meaning a substance formulated alongside the active ingredient of a medication for the purpose of long-term stabilization. The dangers of its use, however, were well-documented. The problem ? Doctors and scientists had lumped immune response with immunity, making a grave mistake that's still assumed to be true today. The myth is that the greater the allergic response to the vaccine, the greater the immunity that is conferred. Wrong! Today, anyone who challenges this myth is referred to as anti-science, anti-vaccine and a conspiracy theorist. There is no faster way for a doctor to lose their license to practice medicine than to challenge this commandment of vaccine mythology. 1980 to 2016: Correlating the massive surge in severe childhood allergies When did these childhood allergies experience a massive upsurge in number? Answer: When the mandated schedule of the number and frequency of vaccines for children under age 7 doubled, and then tripled. Take a look: 1980 <U+2013> 20 vaccines 1995 <U+2013> 40 vaccines 2016 <U+2013> 70 vaccines What's the easiest way to send a child's body into anaphylactic shock and create severe food allergies for the rest of his/her life? Inject intact proteins from peanuts, eggs and dairy (casein) products directly into the infant's muscle tissue 36 times before the age of 18 months. When normal food becomes extremely toxic to children, the parents should review how those specific ingredients have been introduced to their infant's bodies, and what other dangerous \"trace amounts\" of carcinogens, antibiotics, adjuvants, emulsifiers, preservatives, additives, brewing agents, carriers and \"immune response stimulants\" are being injected into the body repeatedly for no logical reason. Vaccines have never been proven safe or effective ; only studies done by the manufacturers themselves, which have subsequently been proven fraudulent, altered and skewed, are published in order to fool the public. Do you really know what's in most vaccines? Have you ever read the ingredients, warnings, reactions and the documented side effects on a vaccine insert? Here is a summary of the most dangerous vaccine ingredients, for your convenience: 1. Bovine cow serum: Extracted from cow skin. When injected causes connective tissue disorders, arthritis and lupus; also shortness of breath, low blood pressure, chest pain and skin reactions. 2. Sorbitol: Synthetic sweetener which metabolizes very slowly and aggravates IBS and gastrointestinal issues. 3. Hydrolyzed gelatin: Derived from the collagen inside animals' skin and bones. Injecting gelatin poses the risk of infection from synthetic growth hormones and BSE infectivity (mad cow disease). 4. Sodium chloride: Raises blood pressure and inhibits muscle contraction and growth. 5. Egg protein: Vaccines are prepared in eggs (certainly not organic). May contain growth hormones, antibiotics, and salmonella bacteria. 6. Casein: Also known as cow's milk protein, many children experience severe allergic and life-threatening reactions to traces of casein, commonly found in the DTaP vaccine. 7. Thimerosal: A neurotoxic mercury which causes autism: There are 25 mcg in one average flu vaccine, and the EPA safety limit is 5 micrograms, so children who are vaccinated simultaneously with multiple vaccines receive over 10 times the safety limit of mercury in one day. 8. Human albumin: The protein portion of blood from pooled human venous plasma; when injected causes fever, chills, hives, rash, headache, nausea, breathing difficulty, and rapid heart rate. 9. Formaldehyde: Highly carcinogenic fluid used to embalm corpses. Ranked one of the most hazardous compounds to human health; can cause liver damage, gastrointestinal issues, reproductive deformation, respiratory distress and cancer. Peanut oil? Enough said!

Here<U+2019>s Why (VIDEO) By Karen Shiebler on October 29, 2016 Subscribe \nAndrew Sullivan is a well known libertarian thinker. He is an author, a blogger and an outspoken conservative commentator. \nSullivan used to cover the Clinton White House for the New Republic. From the earliest days, he had negative feelings about the Clintons. In describing the Clintons, he said: <U+201C>They are very much the establishment. They are very much after money. They are very much after power.<U+201D> Sullivan was born and raised in England, but attended and graduated from Harvard University, where he earned both Masters and Doctoral degrees in government. The writer ties his conservative beliefs to his Roman Catholic upbringing in a family or Irish descent. Andrew Sullivan has long been outspoken about his dislike for Hillary Clinton. During an appearance on Real Time With Bill Maher, he referred to the former Secretary of State as a <U+201C>talentless hack.<U+201D> He bashed her <U+201C>disastrous<U+201D> time as Secretary, citing the situations in Libya and Iraq as evidence of her lack of judgement. Maher accused Sullivan of hating Hillary, and he didn<U+2019>t disagree. So it has come as a big surprise to many that Sullivan is now publicly and prominently saying, <U+201C>I<U+2019>m with her.<U+201D> The sharp tongued Clinton critic is now planning to vote for her and he is clear about why. He told Brian Williams of MSNBC : <U+201C>There is almost no scenario I could imagine in which I might actually support Hillary Clinton for president except this. Because I honestly believe that Donald J. Trump is not just a normal candidate in this election; that he is a threat to our entire democratic system, that his appearance to the top of the national ticket is probably the gravest crisis in this country<U+2019>s modern history. And I think defeating him is not just something that we should take as a Democrat or Republican or even as a sort of a way of expressing ourselves. It is a way to say for the moment the very core principles of liberal democracy that he is attacking on a daily almost hourly basis.<U+201D> When one of our most outspoken conservative decides that he has to vote for the Democrat out of love for the country, things are looking grim for the GOP. Donald Trump is in deep trouble when someone like Andrew Sullivan calls him the <U+201C>gravest crisis<U+201D> in our recent history. Oh, and one more thing. This will be the very first vote that Andrew Sullivan will be casting as a new American citizen. I hope all of his conservative fans follow in his footsteps. \nFeatured image via MSNBC Video Screengrab .

The bookstore sold 12 copies of Ms. Kelly<U+2019>s book and about 50 copies of <U+201C>Our Revolution<U+201D> during the first week the titles were on sale, he said. Thomas Dunne Books, an imprint of St. Martin<U+2019>s Press,<U+00A0>printed 300,000 hardcover copies<U+00A0>of <U+201C>Our Revolution<U+201D> by Nov. 15 and has since gone back to print, said veteran publisher Thomas Dunne. <U+201C>He<U+2019>s been working like a dog,<U+201D> said Mr. Dunne, referring to Sen. Sanders. <U+201C>He wants it to be successful.<U+201D> Mr. Dunne expects media interest in Sen. Sanders to remain strong through the New Year, driving book sales<U+00A0>through the holidays. <U+201C>He<U+2019>s been waiting nearly his entire life to give this message to huge audiences,<U+201D> said Mr. Dunne. <U+201C>Happily,<U+00A0>they<U+2019>re<U+00A0>buying books.<U+201D> Prior to publication of Sen. Sanders<U+2019>s memoir, Vivien Jennings, owner of the independent store Rainy Day Books based in Fairway, Kan., suggested readers might have had their fill of presidential politics<U+00A0>after<U+00A0>Election Day. Sen. Sanders<U+2019>s book has since sold four copies at her bookstore, while Ms. Kelly<U+2019>s book has sold 16 copies. In addition, Rainy Days Books has sold more than 800 copies of Ms. Kelly<U+2019>s book related to a luncheon it is co-sponsoring with the<U+00A0>The KMBZ Speaker Series on Nov. 29 in Olathe, Kan. <U+201C>People are interested in her book because she was right in the middle of everything,<U+201D> said Ms. Jennings.

The steep fall in the price of French bonds comes amid a wider selloff in government debt following the election of Donald Trump. But French debt, and that of some other European nations, is being particularly punished ahead of a series of key votes in the eurozone , moves that are opening up old fault lines in the region<U+2019>s sovereign bond market. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory and the U.K.<U+2019>s June vote to leave the European Union took markets by surprise and many investors don<U+2019>t want to take risks, even months ahead of the elections. High on the list of political concerns is France<U+2019>s spring vote, where an upset could result in victory for<U+00A0>Marine Le Pen, a<U+00A0>far-right candidate who has threatened to pull Europe<U+2019>s second-largest economy out of the euro. That is adding to pressure<U+00A0>on the currency, which is hovering around its<U+00A0>lowest level against the dollar since March 2015. French bonds are trading at their lowest level against benchmark German debt since early 2014, with the gap in yield now 0.55 of a percentage point, up by 0.33 of a percentage point since early September, according to Tradeweb.<U+00A0>Yields rise as prices fall. <U+201C>The<U+00A0>market was twice bitten, third-time shy<U+2026>first with Brexit, then Trump,<U+201D><U+00A0>said James Athey, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. Investors <U+201C>looked at Marine Le Pen and [her] chances in the French election and said: No, there<U+2019>s not enough risk priced there,<U+201D> he said. The French election is one of a series of eurozone votes that are spooking investors, including<U+00A0>a Dec. 4<U+00A0>referendum in Italy that<U+00A0>could lead<U+00A0>to<U+00A0>the ouster of<U+00A0>the current reform-minded government. As investors sell,<U+00A0>familiar<U+00A0>cracks are appearing<U+00A0>in eurozone debt markets. Bonds from so-called peripheral nations, like Italy and Portugal, are being hit harder than those in the sturdier <U+2019>core<U+2019><U+00A0>economies, like Germany. French debt has typically traded with the core, but its bonds are now also in the firing line. Of course, markets haven<U+2019>t always acted as predicted following recent upsets, with equity and peripheral bonds quickly recovering<U+00A0>from the selling that followed Brexit and shares even rallying after Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory. Moreover, some analysts believe the ECB<U+2019>s bond buying program acts as something of a backstop on further declines. On Sunday, voters will choose the presidential candidate for the French center-right party Les<U+00A0>R<U+00E9>publicains. Polls and bookmakers<U+00A0>widely predict<U+00A0>Sunday<U+2019>s<U+00A0>winner to beat Ms. Le Pen of the far-right<U+00A0>Front National<U+00A0>in the runoff in next<U+00A0>spring<U+2019>s presidential election run. But investors point to the failure of polls and bookies to predict Brexit and Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory. For markets, a victory for Ms. Le Pen could represent an even more seismic event if she pulls France out of the euro, as she has promised. Many lawmakers and analysts believe such a move would deal a fatal blow to the single currency. <U+201C>The risk of a substantial shakedown to the European order<U+2014>far, far bigger than Brexit<U+2014>is not one to be dismissed lightly,<U+201D> said Paul Griffiths, chief investment officer, fixed income and multi asset solutions at First State Investments. Concern over the future of the euro is putting pressure on the currency and dragging down some government debt. In recent years, government bonds have acted as a barometer for concern over the euro. Before 2008, and the financial crisis, borrowing rates across the euro area converged as investors bet the single currency would last. Markets deemed Greek bonds almost as safe as those from Germany. But<U+00A0>during the eurozone<U+2019>s 2010 to 2012 sovereign debt crisis, the spread between riskier southern European and German bonds ballooned as investors priced in a greater probability that these countries would leave the euro. The European Central Bank ended that crisis by vowing to safeguard the euro<U+2019>s future, driving bond spreads back down. Since 2015, its massive bond-buying program has reduced those spreads further. But spreads are on the move again. Italian bonds have been particularly hard hit ahead of its referendum, with the spread against 10-year German debt jumping nearly 0.7 percentage point since early September. Other eurozone countries<U+00A0>that sold off during previous periods of stress, such as Spain, Portugal and Ireland, have also underperformed. But the selling of bonds from core countries, including Austria, Germany and the Netherlands, has been more muted. The euro<U+2019>s recent decline has much to do with the dollar, which has risen as investors anticipate U.S. interest rate rises. But political risk is also weighing on the currency. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s a lot of potential hiccups for the euro and the worst case scenario from these events is they could question the very coherence of the [European] project,<U+201D> said Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Dutch lender Rabobank.

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-administration-issues-rules-on-methane-from-oil-gas-operations-1479229206 \n text: WASHINGTON<U+2014>The Interior Department issued regulations Tuesday to cut<U+00A0>methane<U+00A0>emissions from oil and natural-gas operations on federal lands, one of the last moves President Barack Obama will make on his expansive climate agenda, which President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to dismantle . The rules are aimed at helping meet an Obama administration goal of cutting the oil-and-gas industry<U+2019>s emissions of<U+00A0>methane, a potent greenhouse gas, by as much as 45% from 2012 levels over the next decade. The U.S. government is unlikely to meet that goal because Mr. Trump has been clear that he intends to reverse Mr. Obama<U+2019>s climate agenda and withdraw rules that could restrict oil and natural-gas development. However, the president-elect hasn<U+2019>t explicitly said he would undo this<U+00A0>methane<U+00A0>rule or another similar one at the Environmental Protection Agency. <U+201C>This rule to prevent waste of our nation<U+2019>s natural gas supplies is good government, plain and simple,<U+201D> Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said in a statement. <U+201C>We are proving that we can cut harmful methane emissions that contribute to climate change, while putting in place standards that make good economic sense for the nation.<U+201D> The American Petroleum Institute criticized the regulations by the Interior Department<U+2019>s Bureau of Land Management, saying it wasn<U+2019>t needed. <U+201C>If the goal is to prevent emissions, not impede U.S. energy production, then the BLM should focus on fixing permitting, infrastructure and pipeline delays that slow our nation<U+2019>s ability to capture more natural gas and deliver affordable energy to consumers,<U+201D> the group said. Meanwhile, the Independent Petroleum Association of America and the Western Energy Alliance, another group representing independents, filed a lawsuit challenging the final rule Tuesday, saying it went beyond the powers Congress had granted the BLM to regulate air quality. <U+201C>This is an 11th-hour shot by an administration that doesn<U+2019>t fully understand how its rules impact our businesses,<U+201D> said Dan Naatz, the IPAA<U+2019>s senior vice president of government relations and political affairs. Oil-and-gas production has boomed in the U.S. over the past decade thanks to new extraction technologies such as hydraulic fracturing. Still, federal lands account for a small portion of domestic drilling<U+2014>11% of the nation<U+2019>s natural gas supply and 5% of its oil supply<U+2014>according to Interior Department data. The Interior Department regulations,<U+00A0>first proposed<U+00A0>in January 2016, include the first-ever federal limits on flaring, a process in which excess gas, whose primary component is<U+00A0>methane, is burned off as carbon dioxide. The rules also include a requirement that companies regularly inspect for<U+00A0>methane<U+00A0>leaks. With the onset of the energy boom, some companies have taken to flaring or venting gas, emitting the<U+00A0>methane<U+00A0>itself straight into the atmosphere, if pipelines or other infrastructure aren<U+2019>t immediately available to transport and process it. The new rules would require energy companies to capture the<U+00A0>methane<U+00A0>and ship it as fuel. Methane<U+00A0>has a warming impact on the planet 25 times that of carbon dioxide, though it lasts not nearly as long in the atmosphere, according to the Obama administration. The regulations by the Interior Department are part of a recent sprint throughout the administration to<U+00A0>release rules<U+00A0>before Mr. Obama leaves the White House. Some of Mr. Obama<U+2019>s major environmental rules have been challenged in court, and Mr. Trump has said he would review all of them and likely work to rescind most of them. Mr. Trump and GOP leaders in Congress have a couple of different avenues to block Mr. Obama<U+2019>s recently completed rules. Congress can use a little-known law called the Congressional Review Act to nullify rules that have been completed<U+00A0>within 60 days<U+00A0>that Congress is in session, a time period that often extends much longer than a couple of months since lawmakers aren<U+2019>t in session every weekday. Given that the GOP controls both chambers of Congress and will hold White House next year, undoing Mr. Obama<U+2019>s regulatory agenda this way will be one of the easiest avenues. Some legislative experts say rules that could fall under this 60-day window might extend as far back as May, as Congress has been in session so few days in the second half of this year. Nov. 20<U+00A0>has been considered the unofficial deadline by which the Obama administration must issue rules before the window opens for the incoming Trump administration to stop the rules unilaterally. Most regulations require at least 60 days between a rule being final and it going into effect. If a new administration steps in sometime in that 60-day window, the incoming president can put an indefinite hold on the rule<U+2019>s effective date. <U+2014>Lynn Cook contributed to this article.

With places like Puma Punku that have Quick Crete stones that have these shapes in them... And you can clearly see that Ancient Man were telling us in the future that one day would have our green plantations marked by streaks of gold. Obviously being a circuitry board. Our heaven is dependency on technology! This is Teotihuacan People were inspired to build such large and grandiose structures and attribute them to the Sun and the Moon. But why obviously the sun being a life giver is something to honor. But the Moon is a great question. Night is the absence of the Sun and everything depending on the Sun surely would not want to celebrate it's absence. It must be because the Sun was attributed to a great king who sailed across a mighty ocean much like the sun does the sky. And the moon was attributed to a great queen that did the same. And both of them must have proven with great detail. That not only made you believe past all the great technology they brought with them but also believing in them with your heart and soul. That kind of belief transcends time and it also transcends race and species. Those people knew that the moon was not real proof of this is that they symbolize the moon with the crescent moon. If you pay attention at all the moon like god and everything else on the planet snitches what the truth is no matter how good it is at hiding it. And the crescent moon is a snitch that it can cloak and uncloak. Otherwise why would anyone attribute the night with the moon. You would just mark tiny dots in a sky and point to the day and say absent of the sun. It means that while we are very technologically dependent we are being told to believe through what is natural and what mother nature has intended you to see. Why advancement is necessary it's also good to stay rooted and see that everything from top to bottom no matter how primitive still believes in the same Sun and Moon that all life depend on. And that kind of love builds cities,nations, and galactic kingdoms.",

That<U+2019>s truly <U+2026> good grief. <U+201C>I will tell you at the time. <U+2026> I<U+2019>ll keep you in suspense,<U+201D> he told Wednesday<U+2019>s debate moderator, Chris Wallace. The word <U+201C>rigged<U+201D> came up. Yow. Hillary Clinton noted that Trump tends to presume that whenever he loses anything, the system was rigged: <U+201C>There was even a time when he didn<U+2019>t get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged.<U+201D> <U+201C>I should have gotten it,<U+201D> Trump retorted. This is obviously what we should have known was coming when the host of <U+201C>The Celebrity Apprentice<U+201D> wound up as a presidential nominee. But jeepers, people, this is serious. Trump was refusing to acknowledge it was even possible for him to lose a fair fight. At one point, he announced the election was rigged because Hillary Clinton was in it. (<U+201C>She should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with emails.<U+201D>) The rigged-election moment overshadowed everything else in the debate, during which Trump made very strange faces while Clinton was talking, but did manage to avoid going completely off the rails. Does that make him a success? We are once again faced with the problem of the very, very low bar. Still, no. He did manage, particularly in the early part of the debate, to ignore Clinton<U+2019>s effort to get his goat. When she claimed he <U+201C>choked<U+201D> at his meeting with the president of Mexico, he kept pretty calm. Although Trump did observe, weirdly, that when it came to immigration, under President Obama <U+201C>millions of people have been moved out of this country. <U+2026> She doesn<U+2019>t want to say that, but that<U+2019>s what<U+2019>s happened <U+2026> big league.<U+201D> Is moving people out not the whole Trump plan? They also had a whopping argument about <U+2014> guess who? Vladimir Putin! <U+201C>Putin from everything I see has no respect for this person,<U+201D> Trump said, referring to Clinton. The fight went on for a while, until she cannily managed to divert the discussion to the possibility of placing Trump<U+2019>s <U+201C>finger on the nuclear button.<U+201D> O.K., two critical takeaways. Trump won<U+2019>t promise to concede if he loses, and if he wins, he gets control of the nukes. These are the only things you need to think about for the next two and a half weeks. We have been down this debate road before, and we knew before the evening started that when Trump was asked about groping women, he<U+2019>d deny everything, blame it on Hillary Clinton and then bring up the emails. And that when the emails came up, Clinton would mention the way Trump insulted John McCain<U+2019>s war record, the Mexican-American judge and the parents of the dead war hero. <U+201C>Such a nasty woman,<U+201D> Trump said at one point. As the debate went on, he got more sullen, his expressions stranger. One of the things we have now learned for sure, three debates running, is that he has a serious stamina problem. Hillary Clinton has many faults. She tends to give long, rather boring answers. She has never learned how to deal with the email question. But the woman is an absolute rock in these long-running, high-stress critical encounters. Also, she made it very clear that she would accept the results of the election, even if she lost. God help us all. Clinton was not particularly good in defending the Clinton Foundation. However, it did seem fair for her to point out that Trump used some of his own foundation<U+2019>s money to purchase a six-foot portrait of himself. (<U+201C>Who does that?<U+201D>) But what difference did it all make? The man wouldn<U+2019>t promise to concede if he loses. Later on CNN, his campaign manager said Trump would indeed accept the results <U+201C>because he<U+2019>s going to win the election.<U+201D> This was not particularly reassuring. If you were totally ignoring the entire event, you might want to know that nobody shook hands, that it took Clinton an hour to mention that Trump had never released his tax returns, and that whenever she pointed out that he had purchased the very same Chinese steel and aluminum he complained was ruining the economy, he said that it was her fault for not changing the laws. She did bring up the Miss-Universe-is-fat moment, and Trump said <U+201C>give me a break.<U+201D> He promised to run the country <U+201C>the way I run my company,<U+201D> and a great part of the listening public contemplated the fact that this is a guy who<U+2019>s declared bankruptcy six times. But we<U+2019>ve already forgotten all about it. Only one thing matters. The man says he won<U+2019>t promise to accept the results of the election. All those establishment Republicans who<U+2019>ve been hoping to get through this ordeal by just being quiet and looking sad have got some work to do. Fast. Nicholas Kristof is off today.

And, once again, we<U+2019>re learning more about the inner sanctum of the administration and its communication practices. As FBI Director James Comey announced Friday, a new investigation into Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s email scandal has been launched, just days before the presidential election. Comey<U+2019>s move drew fire instantly from the Democrats who claim Comey is attempting to sway the election in Donald Trump<U+2019>s favor. While many are focused on Comey<U+2019>s actions and renewed investigation, Wikileaks has uncovered what may prove to be a systemic problem of executive branch accountability not merely limited to the former secretary of state<U+2019>s emails.\nAccording to former State Department official Tom Nides, in a 2015 email to John Podesta (Clinton campaign manager), everyone in Obama<U+2019>s cabinet and every White House staffer uses their personal email for government business. Nides should know as he worked under Hillary Clinton in the State Department from 2011 to 2013, according to one source .\nWhile keeping email hidden from the public may seem like no big deal to folks who simply don<U+2019>t care, ALL correspondence which is related to governmental business is the property of the federal government and is supposed to be accessible by anyone wishing to inquire within the archive of records.\nThe Federal Records Act defines a record as anything, <U+201C>regardless of whether it exists in physical, digital, or electronic form, is a record as defined in subsection (a) shall be binding on all Federal agencies.<U+201D> This includes all communication of state agents (like the POTUS) who work in the executive branch of government, as well.\nBut the Obama administration, according to Nides, has long since avoided the Federal Records Act by using private Gmail accounts.

This story is definitely a long way from being over.\nIt<U+2019>s no wonder why so many free thinkers are now questioning the story lines they<U+2019>re being told. With the president and all his men (and women), hiding their communications within their Gmail accounts, the truth is never going to be told, at least not the real truth. And by the time organizations like Judicial Watch are successful in obtaining the electronic communications records that rightly belong to the people, it will be way too late to hold anyone accountable for breaking both the Federal Records Act and the Freedom of Information Act.

Dyer \n source: thefederalistpapers.org \n text: Pinterest \nOregon militia leaders Ammon and Ryan Bundy, along with several others, were acquitted on Thursday in relation to their 41-day standoff at a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon earlier this year, CNN has reported . Shaun King wrote in the New York Daily News that the acquittal was an example of <U+201C>white privilege.<U+201D> \nLiberal race-baiters have jumped to the fore in the wake of the acquittal to make such claims without any understanding of the case. \nAccording to King, if these had been Black Lives Matter activists, they wouldn<U+2019>t have been acquitted. Neither would Muslim-American activists in King<U+2019>s racist world. \nKing claimed that BLM protesters would be treated very differently: \nImagine just for a moment that heavily-armed Black Lives Matter activists took over a federal building. It<U+2019>s doubtful that such a siege would last longer than a day. By and large, unarmed, non-violent peaceful black protestors are arrested on sight when they even block the entrance to a federal building. Many are still facing charges for such simple acts of civil disobedience to this very day and they did nothing like what the Bundy clan did in Oregon. \nSet aside the fact that King has no clue about what the Bundys did and why they did it <U+2014> if he did he would understand why his comparison doesn<U+2019>t hold water <U+2014> he also doesn<U+2019>t realize that we don<U+2019>t have to imagine much here in relation to BLM activists. \nWere BLM protesters <U+201C>non-violent<U+201D> when they blocked major highways? How about when they beat an innocent white man? What about the rampant looting of innocent store owners in the wake of officer involved shootings? Then there are the police officers whose lives have been ruined, despite the fact that the shootings were found to have been justified, because race-baiters jumped to conclusions and incited violence to further their agenda. \nWe see an enormous amount of lawlessness committed in the wake of officer-involved shootings that has nothing to do with the <U+201C>cause<U+201D><U+2014> which is roundly debunked by the facts <U+2014> but people like King still defend it. \nWhen a black man is killed by police, the police are condemned before the facts are in and even after it<U+2019>s shown that a particular shooting was justified. \nI wonder if King and other race-baiters cared as much when Oregon militia leader LaVoy Finicum was killed in an officer-involved shooting. That<U+2019>s not to say whether it was justified or not, but that never stops the racial grievance mongers from protesting and rioting, does it? What<U+2019>s the only difference there? Oh, Finicum was white. \nHere<U+2019>s what King had so say about how Muslim activists would be treated: \nOr imagine that an armed group of Muslim-American activists took over a federal building. I<U+2019>m not talking about immigrants or people on the terrorist watch list, but just good, old fashioned American students who happened to be Muslims. Do you think they<U+2019>d be allowed to continue their takeover for 41 days? Do you think they<U+2019>d be acquitted at trial? Those young men would likely be taken to Gitmo. I<U+2019>m not even kidding. \nReally? So that<U+2019>s why this country allows in refugees that we can<U+2019>t properly vet and refuses to monitor known radical mosques<U+2026>because things are so biased against Muslims? \nApparently King has never heard of things called hate crime laws or affirmative action <U+2014> two things that represent the true <U+201C>systemic racism<U+201D> plaguing this country. \nWhat kind of <U+201C>white privilege<U+201D> did the more than 80 white people killed <U+2014> including women and children <U+2014> in the Waco siege have, Mr. King? \nPeople like King really do live in a fantasy land of alleged racism, that is self-imposed by their inability and/or unwillingness to critically think for themselves. Then again, there<U+2019>s a lot of money to be made in peddling racial division based on lies, so it certainly could be that as well<U+2026>",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Eddy Lavine \n source: worldtruth.tv \n text: posted by Eddie For the first time, scientists have observed a two-headed shark growing in an egg. This catshark ( Galeus atlanticus ) lives only in the western Mediterranean, at depths of 330 to 710 meters (1,082 to 2,329 feet), and is considered near threatened. Workers on a research vessel collected the embryonic fish as part of an expedition that retrieved 797 embryos from the western Mediterranean sea. It had two brains, four eyes, two mouths, twenty gills (double the usual ten), and two notochords <U+2014> a developmental precursor of the spine. The two heads fused at the neck. Inside, it had two hearts, and a doubled digestive system that fused together where two stomachs met at a single intestine. When an animal has two heads it is said to exhibit dicephaly. The condition is relatively rare in the animal kingdom but has been seen in many different groups, from snakes to dolphins to people. You can see the shark in this figure, drawn from a paper in the Journal of Fish Biology where the researchers describe their discovery. Figures (d) and (e) depict another shark embryo with a single head. Two-headedness is believed to happen in all animals with spines. But it<U+2019>s rare enough that it<U+2019>s never been spotted in an egg-laying shark before. As recently as 1992 , some researchers believed that the uncommon body structure was the result of twins incompletely merging together. But now it<U+2019>s widely accepted that the cause is actually an incomplete separation of one embryo into two. No one has yet offered a conclusive explanation for what causes this to happen. The two-headed shark embryo described in this paper would probably not have survived had it developed <U+2014> though it won<U+2019>t get the chance to try. When the researchers spotted the doubled shark through the translucent walls of its egg, they split the egg open and preserved the embryo for study. Read the original article on Tech Insider .

By Josh Gerstein 11/06/16 03:30 PM EST Updated 11/06/16 09:30 PM EST Just over a week after FBI Director James Comey rolled a grenade into the presidential race by announcing the arrival of new evidence in the Hillary Clinton email probe, he offered what amounted to a \"never mind\" Sunday, notifying Congress that the newly discovered messages wouldn't change the bureau's conclusion that no prosecution of Clinton was warranted. In a letter sent to House and Senate committee leaders, Comey said FBI agents had completed their review of all messages to or from Clinton on a laptop seized last month from the estranged husband of a Clinton aide and had found nothing momentous. Story Continued Below \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,\" Comey wrote. \"I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short-period of time.\" The disclosure, just two days before Election Day, could undercut a boost Donald Trump appeared to enjoy in some polls taken after Comey's disclosure late last month about the newly-discovered set of email messages. But millions of voters have already cast mail-in, absentee or early voting ballots and it's unclear how many of the remaining voters will absorb news of Comey's latest announcement, which came less than 48 hours before polls open for traditional, in-person voting. 2016 By Steven Shepard Clinton's campaign immediately tried to capitalize on the news, claiming that Comey's latest missive put to rest any new concerns about the email issue. \"We're glad this matter is resolved,\" Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said. But Trump rejected Comey's latest announcement, dismissing the FBI's conclusions and supplanting them with his own. <U+201C>You can't review 650,000 emails in eight days,\" Trump said Sunday during a campaign rally in Michigan -- misrepresenting the numbers of emails subject to the agency's fresh review in the process. \"You can't do it, folks. Hillary Clinton is guilty.<U+201D> <U+201C>The investigations into her crimes will go on for a long, long time,\" Trump added. \"The rank-and-file special agents at the FBI won't let her get away with her terrible crimes, including the deletion of her 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena.\" Comey threw the presidential contest into an uproar and unleashed a firestorm of criticism from inside and outside his own ranks after he told Congress on Oct. 28 that he'd instructed investigators to take steps to examine new evidence in the Clinton email probe. It soon emerged that the new evidence was a trove of email messages found on a laptop the FBI obtained during a probe into alleged sexting with a minor by former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), the estranged husband of longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Top Justice Department officials, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch, counseled Comey against sending the letter. They warned that doing so violated a Justice Department tradition of not taking such politically sensitive steps in the 60 days before an election. But he apparently decided that the political risks of withholding information from Congress outweighed the dangers of speaking up. Among those who joined in the chorus of criticism of Comey was President Barack Obama. \"I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations, we don't operate on innuendo and we don't operate on incomplete information and we don't operate on leaks,\" Obama said in an interview last week with \"NowThis News.\" \"We operate based on concrete decisions that are made.\" A Justice Department spokesman issued a brief statement on Sunday afternoon, saying only, <U+201C>The Department of Justice and the FBI dedicated all necessary resources to conduct this review expeditiously.<U+201D> Comey's October letter also seemed to trigger a wave of leaks from inside the FBI, chiefly from agents angry about the initial decision to recommend no prosecution of Clinton and about various reported decisions by the Justice Department not to broaden inquiries into alleged corruption involving the Clinton Foundation. Trump seized on Comey<U+2019>s original letter to lawmakers as proof of Clinton<U+2019>s corruption, and he warned voters that the former secretary of state would likely be found guilty soon after taking office. And he heaped praise on Comey after he sent word to Congress of the renewed investigation. <U+201C>It took guts for Director Comey to make the move that he made, in light of the kind of opposition he had, where they<U+2019>re trying to protect her from criminal prosecution,<U+201D> Trump told a Michigan rally on Oct. 31. <U+201C>He<U+2019>s gotta hang tough. A lot of people want him to do the wrong thing. What he did was the right thing.<U+201D> Just after the news broke Sunday, Trump took the stage at a rally in Minnesota and did not mention the FBI probe specifically, as he has done at most of his recent appearances. However, the GOP nominee accused Clinton of committing <U+201C>many crimes<U+201D> that have spurred investigations <U+201C>likely concluding in a criminal trial.<U+201D> Trump also returned to his familiar accusations that the system is rigged in Clinton<U+2019>s favor. <U+201C>You have to understand it<U+2019>s a rigged system and she<U+2019>s protected,<U+201D> he said. The latest FBI disclosure also set off skirmishing on Twitter between Clinton and Trump partisans. By POLITICO Staff \"We were always confident nothing would cause the July decision to be revisited. Now Director Comey has confirmed it,\" Clinton campaign press secretary Brian Fallon wrote . Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway highlighted a kind of rhetorical whiplash from Clinton allies, who vouched for Comey's integrity when he announced no plans for charges but savaged him when he disclosed the renewal of the investigation just over a week ago. \"Then why did you, your colleagues, and your candidate attack Comey and his credibility?\" Conway asked . However, in an interview a short time later, Conway seemed to do her own verbal somersault, appearing to contradict her candidate's positive statements about Comey in recent days. \"He's mishandled this investigation from the very beginning,\" Conway insisted on MSNBC.

I have always gotten along with the assumption that politics is \"the art of the possible.\" But, let us give a good look at it. What is in this formula, if not a put down; a downgrading, so downgrading, characterization of this noble science? No wonder politics has become the art of bickering; the art of discord; the art of grasping at reefs, while we are drowning in perilous waters. No wonder, politics in the United States and much around the world has become polarized between two factions that fight for supremacy to the death. Not the death of the political class, but to the psychological and physical death of millions of people--in this country, the richest of the countries, the last best hope for mankind. Let alone the millions overseas. No wonder both the right and the left are focused on this set of policies: \"Deny them their rights; take their dignity away; give them a warm soup in a cold winter night; and go to sleep in peace.\" What to say of this debasement of charity?

This is Hillary who is called to lead her class, not via invitation by academicians or administrators at Wellesley, but by her classmates who recognized the force of her leadership.

That means Hillary Clinton could become the first Democratic presidential nominee to win a majority of Cuban-Americans, potentially shifting the balance of power statewide. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s plausible she gets to 50%, and in a close election, that could tilt the balance,<U+201D> said Al Cardenas, the former Cuban-American chairman of the Florida Republican Party.<U+00A0><U+201C>The question is whether Trump is an outlier or if there is permanent damage to the Republican Party in Florida.<U+201D> Cuban-Americans have tilted toward Republican since the 1980s, when then-President Ronald Reagan <U+2019>s anti-Communist fervor emboldened an exile community that had fled Fidel Castro. Trips to Little Havana were a rite of passage for White House hopefuls, who would declare <U+201C>Cuba Libre!<U+201D> and sip a<U+00A0>cafecito<U+00A0>to<U+00A0>show solidarity. Signs of realignment emerged in 2012, when Cuban-Americans in Florida split nearly evenly between President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney, according to exit polls. <U+2018> This will be the first time in my life that I don<U+2019>t cast a ballot for the Republican presidential nominee. <U+2019> Mr. Trump<U+2019>s allies say they remain confident he will win this bloc of voters and the state, but they acknowledge the challenges. Of the 2.6 million eligible Hispanic voters in Florida, about 31% are Cuban-American, most of whom live in Miami-Dade. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s brutal being the only one on the circuit,<U+201D> said Rep. Carlos Trujillo of Miami, the only Cuban-American state lawmaker campaigning for Mr. Trump. Cuban-American Republicans who have either sworn off Mr. Trump or pledged to vote for Mrs. Clinton include two of the three members of Congress representing Miami-Dade County, the mayor of Miami-Dade and the mayor of the city of Miami. <U+201C>For me, country first, then party,<U+201D> says former U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez says in a television ad for Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Gutierrez is a Republican who served under former President George W. Bush. The Latin Builders Association, a prominent Miami industry group founded by Cuban exiles, recently endorsed Mrs. Clinton, the first time in its 45-year history it has supported a Democratic presidential nominee. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American who was forced out of the Republican primary after losing in his home state to Mr. Trump, has endorsed but declined to campaign with the GOP nominee. In a 34-minute speech last week at a Florida Republican Party dinner, Mr. Rubio didn<U+2019>t mention Mr. Trump once. Much of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s support in the Cuban-American community appears to be less about enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket and more of a backlash against the Republican nominee. <U+201C>This will be the first time in my life that I don<U+2019>t cast a ballot for the Republican presidential nominee,<U+201D> said Rudy Fernandez, a veteran of the Republican National Committee, over lunch at a Miami-area restaurant where patrons alternated between Spanish and English as they chatted.<U+00A0><U+201C>It<U+2019>s not that I am a fan of Hillary Clinton, but I see Trump as a real, imminent danger to our democratic system.<U+201D> At the Miami-Dade Republican Party<U+2019>s annual dinner last week, prominent Cuban-Americans trickled in, exchanging air kisses and bilingual greetings. <U+201C>I have my own race,<U+201D> said state Rep. Rene Garcia, when asked if he was supporting Mr. Trump. Florida<U+2019>s lieutenant governor, Carlos Lopez-Cantera, refused to say whether he was voting for the GOP nominee. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m not voting for Hillary Clinton,<U+201D> he said several times. State Rep. Jose Felix Diaz, who was a 25-year-old attorney when he was chosen to appear on Season 5 of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s show <U+201C>The Apprentice,<U+201D> said he is torn between his perception of a successful businessman and a candidate who has denigrated immigrants, women and Muslims. <U+201C>He<U+2019>s someone who gave me an opportunity very early on in my career,<U+201D> Mr. Diaz said. He said he doesn<U+2019>t know if he will vote for Mr. Trump. Miami-Dade, where nearly three out of four Republicans are Cuban-American, was the only county Mr. Trump lost to Mr. Rubio in the March primary. Mr. Trump is leading Mrs. Clinton by 7 percentage points among Cuban-Americans in Miami-Dade, according to a new poll by WLRN-Univision 23, a local radio and television affiliate. A Univision News poll in September found Cuban-Americans evenly divided between the two nominees, with 41% for each. Those figures signal a drastic drop in Republican support from 2004, when Mr. Bush won 78% of the Cuban vote in Florida and set a high-water mark for GOP nominees with at least 40% of Hispanics nationwide, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Mr. Trump is trying to shore up the Cuban-American vote in Florida as polls show other swing states are drifting out of his reach. <U+201C>The people of Cuba have struggled too long,<U+201D> Mr. Trump posted on Twitter last week. <U+201C>Will reverse Obama<U+2019>s Executive Orders and concessions towards Cuba until freedoms are restored.<U+201D> That sentiment represents a turnaround from Mr. Trump<U+2019>s position 13 months ago, when he approved of Mr. Obama<U+2019>s opening of diplomatic relations with Cuba. <U+201C>I think it<U+2019>s fine, but we should have made a better deal<U+2026>50 years is enough,<U+201D> he said in an interview with the Daily<U+00A0>Caller . Last week, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign dispatched vice presidential nominee Mike Pence to the Miami-Dade GOP dinner with just two days<U+2019> notice. The Indiana governor earned a standing ovation for pledging to reverse the administration<U+2019>s diplomacy toward Cuba. But that issue doesn<U+2019>t carry the weight it once did in the broader community. A recent Florida International University poll showed 63% of Cuban-American residents of Miami-Dade oppose the continuation of the embargo, a sweeping change from 20 years ago, when 78% supported the embargo. Mrs. Clinton favors lifting the embargo, a reversal from her 2008 presidential campaign, when she said Cuba had to move toward democratic reforms before the U.S. should change its policy. However, as polls showed support for the sanctions dwindling, she wrote in her 2014 memoir that as secretary of state she urged President Obama to lift the embargo. In her first public appearance in Florida as a presidential candidate in 2015, she said the embargo <U+201C>needs to go, once and for all.<U+201D> If Mrs. Clinton wins the state, Florida would have elected its first national candidate who favors lifting the embargo. Many older Cuban-Americans in the state view the administration<U+2019>s new relations with Cuba as a betrayal, rewarding the repressive regime while it still denies basic human rights and civil liberties to its people. Remedios Diaz, a Miami business leader and loyal Republican, left Cuba in 1961, while two of her teenage schoolmates were shot by a firing squad. Her family<U+2019>s home and the private schools owned by her parents were left behind. She<U+2019>s <U+201C>not in love<U+201D> with Mr. Trump but can<U+2019>t vote for a Democrat. <U+201C>I cannot forget,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>I cannot forgive.<U+201D> Write to Beth Reinhard at beth.reinhard@wsj.com",

Virtually every item on the Trump administration<U+2019>s to-do list makes the country weaker, from the gutting of environmental and financial regulation, to the destabilization of international security treaties, to reducing access to health care, to the terrorization of young people working and studying under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. More to the point, the stunning disarray, nepotism, score-settling and incompetence of the Trump transition effort make clear that your administration will not be <U+201C>assisting<U+201D> a transition. You will be the ones making the transition happen. History and the national interest may demand that you not be obstructionist. But nothing requires a more positive effort in the transition, except for national security. The courtesy of President Bush toward you is not the same: Your teams met with his, as professionals in government, albeit with policy differences. Instructing Islamophobic kooks, white supremacists and oil industry hacks in how better to degrade America is something else entirely. CHRISTOPHER KUTZ Berkeley, Calif. To the Editor: This is just too embarrassing. Donald Trump is up in his ivory tower going through the motions of selecting the team that will be responsible for our government. From the little updates and tidbits we are privy to, one wonders if this is not an audition for a coming season of his program <U+201C>The Apprentice.<U+201D> The infighting, indecisiveness, hiring and firing, and mostly the inexperience of these folks all sound like a casting session for the TV show. And worse, instead of his communicating with the media, one has to look up his tweets. Heaven help us. VICTORIA FLORA Norwalk, Conn. To the Editor: Let<U+2019>s face the facts <U+2014> no one likes change, even if our lives are not good, but change was necessary. Our government was at a stalemate, totally dysfunctional. We needed a major revamping. But who could possibly do it? We needed someone brave, honest, independent, wealthy, thick-skinned, successful and brash enough to fight the total entrenchment of establishments strangling our American dream. Someone who was comfortable in front of the media. We got what we wished. Donald Trump is not perfect, but he is perfect for change. We are now on a path into the unknown <U+2014> an adventure that the American spirit has always embraced. We lost that spirit for a while, but Mr. Trump reminded us how we can regain it. Mr. Trump has proved himself in business but, more important, he has proved himself in politics in an unconventional but brilliant campaign. He defied all odds. How can we doubt that he will succeed in his next phase <U+2014> making America great again? CHARLES SLANE New York To the Editor: It<U+2019>s extraordinary. Donald Trump could not go a week without going back on the central premise of his campaign: to <U+201C>drain the swamp,<U+201D> banishing Washington<U+2019>s powerful special interests who have <U+201C> rigged our political and economic system.<U+201D> This promise of railing against the establishment won him the Republican nomination. His promise to <U+201C>not be controlled by the donors, special interests and lobbyists who have corrupted our politics and politicians,<U+201D> like Hillary Clinton, helped swing the Rust Belt in his favor so that he could win the election.

Bender \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-proposes-new-lobbying-restrictions-1476757359 \n text: GREEN BAY, Wis.<U+2014> Donald Trump on Monday outlined a package of <U+201C>ethics reforms<U+201D> that he said he would push for if elected, including legislation that would ban executive branch officials and members of Congress from lobbying the government for five years after they leave office. Mr. Trump pointed to his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, as an example of why such reforms are needed, citing contributions from foreign governments to the Clinton family foundation. He said one of his proposals is a lifelong ban on senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. Mr. Trump also proposed campaign-finance reform that prevents <U+201C>registered foreign lobbyists<U+201D> from raising money for U.S. elections and said he would expand the definition of lobbyist so former government officials couldn<U+2019>t get around the rules by calling themselves <U+201C>consultants.<U+201D> <U+201C>This will go a long way in ending government corruption,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said in a speech accompanying the release of a sparsely detailed <U+201C>five-point plan for ethics reform.<U+201D> Lobbyists and special interests have been a top target of Mr. Trump since the start of his campaign. He has said lobbyists and special interests own <U+201C>outright<U+201D> the political class in Washington and have destroyed U.S. manufacturing jobs and hurt the middle class. Yet Mr. Trump has been an active participant in the system he excoriates, giving hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republicans and Democrats<U+2014>including to past campaigns of Hillary Clinton. He has acknowledged that he donated money only to have favors returned to him. But he has described this in positive terms, saying he knows how the system works and how to break it. Until now, Mr. Trump has offered no details about how he would change the system. Instead, he has spoken only about how he would be less beholden to special interests because he is putting his money into his campaign. Still, new campaign-finance reports filed Saturday show that five big Republican donors poured at least $24 million into groups supporting Mr. Trump. Among those donors were billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, who gave $10 million to Future45, a super PAC backing Mr. Trump, and Bernie Marcus, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot Inc., who donated $5 million to a second pro-Trump group, Rebuilding America Now.

Now Russian President Vladimir Putin has proclaimed to American voters if they choose <U+201C>Trump it<U+2019>s peace, if they choose Clinton it<U+2019>s war.<U+201D>\n\nThis comes as no surprise and it<U+2019>s something that many of us feared deep down, but knew that it was likely true. Now Putin has said it out his own mouth. It seems that things are heating up in Ukraine and Syria. With Russian battle ships moving towards Syria and tensions building up along Ukraine<U+2019>s boarder with NATO, it seems like world war could break out any day. As We Are Change<U+2019>s Luke Rudkowski recently pointed out, Russia isn<U+2019>t playing games anymore.\nWith failure after failure of peace talks and cease fires things are getting dangerous and Russia is running out of options. To have Putin come out and say something so straight forward should scare all Americans <U+2014> this is serious.\nEspecially since NATO wants to continue trying to push for war with Russia and the U.S. is a member of NATO. Putin has also vowed retaliation over the U.S. missile system that was setup in Syria.\n\n<U+201C>If Americans vote for Trump, they<U+2019>re voting for peace! <U+201D>If they vote for Clinton, its war.<U+201D> <U+2013> Vladimir Putin. \nIt<U+2019>s no wonder that Putin would make such a strong statement when Hillary Clinton has been for years bashing him. It<U+2019>s additionally been revealed thanks to Wikileaks that Hillary Clinton would enforce a <U+201C>no fly zone<U+201D> in Syria . An instant declaration of war in Russia<U+2019>s eyes. Washington has had troubled relations with Moscow starting from 2012 with Syria and in 2014, when the Ukraine coup was orchestrated by the U.S. <U+2014> as a leaked Victoria Nuland phone call shows. Victoria Nuland answered to Hillary Clinton who was Secretary of State at the time of these discussions, and her leaked call is below.\nA pre-Maidan video of former Ukraine Deputy Oleg Tsarov warning of a civil war coup before it broke out in Ukraine also makes this point. Maiden was the event where snipers shot at both sides of the opposition rebels and police. Polish MP Janusz Korwin-Mikke alleges that what occurred in Ukraine was a special op to provoke a riot.\nThen we had the MH17 incident that has been blamed on Russia and Russian separatist despite the Ukrainian government being allowed to fabricate evidence. \nAdditionally a leaked phone conversation from the EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton and Estonian foreign affairs minister alleges that the snipers were paid for by Maidan leaders .\nSoros is also linked to the Ukraine uprising and he is someone that Vladimir Putin despises, so it<U+2019>s again no surprise that Vladmir Putin would say <U+201C>If Americans vote for Hillary it<U+2019>s war,<U+201D> since Hillary is George Soros<U+2019>s puppet after all.\n<U+201C>Many of the participants in Kiev<U+2019>s <U+2018>EuroMaidan<U+2019> demonstrations were members of Soros-funded NGOs and/or were trained by the same NGOs in the many workshops and conferences sponsored by Soros<U+2019> International Renaissance Foundation (IRF), and his various Open Society institutes and foundations. The IRF, founded and funded by Soros, boasts that it has given <U+2018>more than any other donor organization<U+2019> to <U+2018>democratic transformation<U+2019> of Ukraine,<U+201D> <U+2013> William F. Jasper reports.\nDoes the U.S. really want war with Russia? No the U.S. as a whole doesn<U+2019>t want war, no one likes war but oligarchs and the military industrial complex that profits off of it<U+2019>s citizens blood.\nThat<U+2019>s where Donald Trump sets himself apart, at least according to his campaign promises that he would work with Russia .\nPutin recently expressed support for Trump, saying that <U+201C>Russia<U+2019>s not playing favorites but Trump does speak for the people.<U+201D> Putin added, that <U+201C>Elections have stopped being an instrument of change, and have been reduced to scandals, to mudslinging, to questions of who pinched whom and who is sleeping with whom,<U+201D> during a WSJ interview. \nIf Hillary gets in the Oval Office she will continue her war mongering ways <U+2013> after Libya and Ukraine, Syria is next as General Wesley Clark warned in his 2007 speech .

        "input": "time: null \n author: MARK LANDLER JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/us/politics/obama-presidency.html?_r=0 \n text: WASHINGTON <U+2014> Standing in the Rose Garden, where he once marked the Paris climate accord, celebrated the Supreme Court decision saving his health care law and unveiled the Iran nuclear deal, President Obama promised on Wednesday to <U+201C>root for<U+201D> Donald J. Trump , even though Mr. Trump has vowed to topple those and other pillars of Mr. Obama<U+2019>s legacy. <U+201C>Everybody is sad when their side loses an election,<U+201D> the president declared. <U+201C>But the day after, we have to remember that we<U+2019>re actually all on one team. This is an intramural scrimmage.<U+201D> For Mr. Obama, however, this scrimmage could result in the reversal or dismantling of several of his most cherished achievements <U+2014> laws and agreements that required years of negotiation, heavy doses of political capital, and, in some cases, a stroke of luck. The White House acknowledged that Mr. Obama<U+2019>s signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act, was in genuine jeopardy. Mr. Trump has vowed to repeal it as one of his first acts in office, and a Republican-controlled Congress will prod him to do so. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Obama would lobby Mr. Trump to keep it in place <U+2014> an effort that suggests Mr. Obama believes that Mr. Trump can be persuaded on certain issues. The president invited Mr. Trump to visit the White House on Thursday, and in his remarks, Mr. Obama struck a conciliatory tone toward his successor. <U+201C>We all want what<U+2019>s best for this country,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s what I heard in Mr. Trump<U+2019>s remarks last night. That<U+2019>s what I heard when I spoke to him directly. And I was heartened by that.<U+201D> Mr. Obama also said he <U+201C>could not be prouder<U+201D> of Hillary Clinton. But as the White House absorbed her defeat and cranked up the machinery to transfer power to Mr. Trump, there was an undercurrent of anger among his allies that she had squandered the opportunity left to her by a popular president. <U+201C>President Obama, with an approval rating above 50 and an unemployment rate below 5, did all he could to set the table for a Democrat to succeed him,<U+201D> said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama. <U+201C>Barack Obama will go down in history as one of America<U+2019>s most consequential presidents,<U+201D> Mr. Pfeiffer added. <U+201C>Tuesday is a bitter pill to swallow, but it won<U+2019>t change that fact.<U+201D> The president<U+2019>s remarks capped an emotional day at the White House. Dozens of staff members spilled into the Rose Garden to applaud their boss. Just before he spoke, Mr. Obama pulled a handful of aides into the Oval Office for a pep talk. Earlier on Wednesday morning, several had cried during the daily senior staff meeting. As night fell, Mr. Obama welcomed current and former members of his cabinet to the White House for a thank-you party that was supposed to have been a celebration of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s victory and his administration<U+2019>s work. Instead, it was a gathering of stunned officials, and an aide said Mrs. Clinton would not attend. For weeks, Mr. Obama campaigned like a happy warrior for Mrs. Clinton. But asking people to vote to preserve his legacy was less effective than asking them to vote for him. Some former officials held out hope that the president<U+2019>s health care legacy could be preserved, saying that Mr. Trump would hesitate to deprive 20 million people of health insurance without any substitute, and that Republican lawmakers, having spent more time trying to scrap the existing law than shape a new one, have no consensus on a replacement. New presidents are often less zealous in unraveling their predecessors<U+2019> achievements than in vowing to do so on the campaign trail. Richard M. Nixon left Lyndon B. Johnson<U+2019>s Great Society legislation largely intact; Ronald Reagan, after defeating Jimmy Carter, did not kill off the Education Department. <U+201C>By the time people go after these institutions, they have constituencies of their own,<U+201D> said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian. He added, <U+201C>Given the impulsiveness and the way he goes from pillar to post, it<U+2019>s impossible to predict what Trump will do.<U+201D> Mr. Trump could undermine a major part of the health law by directing the Justice Department to alter its position in a lawsuit filed by House Republicans. At issue in the litigation are <U+201C>cost-sharing subsidies<U+201D> that help pay doctor and hospital bills for millions of lower-income people. A federal district judge has already ruled against the administration, finding that Congress never appropriated money for these subsidies. Republicans will not have a 60-vote majority in the Senate, so they could not overcome a filibuster by Democrats trying to preserve the law. But Republicans could dismantle other elements, including the expansion of Medicaid , using a budget procedure known as reconciliation, which does not require a supermajority. Congress approved such a reconciliation bill in January, which Mr. Obama promptly vetoed. The president<U+2019>s big international agreements face a similarly perilous future. If Mr. Trump were to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord <U+2014> which he has vowed to do, labeling climate change a <U+201C>hoax<U+201D> <U+2014> the agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions would remain legally binding on the United States for four years, but it would lose much of its impact. Mr. Obama<U+2019>s mammoth Asian trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, was in political trouble even before the election. Now, analysts said, it is unlikely to ever get a vote. Mr. Trump has said he would have struck a better nuclear deal with Iran, suggesting he might try to reopen talks. But four other countries also signed the deal, and there is no sign that they would go along with him. Reopening negotiations could also prompt Iran to restart its uranium centrifuges, putting the country back on a path to a nuclear weapon. But the Iranians have been unhappy with the existing deal because the United States has not lifted direct sanctions, chilling foreign investment. That could provide Mr. Trump with an opening, experts said. <U+201C>Reopening the agreement means reopening it for the Iranians, too,<U+201D> said Martin S. Indyk, executive vice president of the Brookings Institution. <U+201C>Given that they<U+2019>re more unhappy with it than we are, President Trump may discover there<U+2019>s more in this deal for our side than he first realized, especially if the alternative is that the Iranians restart their nuclear program .<U+201D> Mr. Obama and his top advisers have always recognized the fragility of his legacy items, especially those achieved by bypassing a recalcitrant Congress. After all, the president himself began plotting almost immediately after winning the White House in 2008 how to accomplish his campaign promises, which included rolling back some of George W. Bush<U+2019>s policies. During Mr. Obama<U+2019>s transition, his advisers consulted a book, <U+201C>With the Stroke of a Pen,<U+201D> which documented the use of executive orders throughout American history, and compiled a set of actions the president could take on his own.

Employee Emailed Veterans<U+2019> Personal Data to Himself By Arnaldo Rodgers on November 11, 2016 VA \nBy dan elliott \nThe Department of Veterans Affairs has warned more than 2,100 veterans in Eastern Colorado and parts of Kansas that their personal information may have been compromised when an employee emailed documents to himself. \nAn agency employee told The Associated Press that he is the person who emailed the information to himself, describing it as unauthorized wait lists used by VA health care facilities in Colorado. The employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he fears retaliation, said he wanted to document the lists because they could have been used to conceal lengthy delays in providing care. \nIn Wednesday<U+2019>s warning to veterans, the VA said the potentially compromised information included veterans<U+2019> full names, the last four digits of their Social Security numbers and medical diagnoses.

Henry (William Sydney Porter) coined the term. It refers to a politically unstable and/or repressive country where a small percent of the population enjoys a disproportionate share of wealth and power. It<U+2019>s where ordinary people are exploited, persecuted, imprisoned, murdered or disappeared for daring to challenge ruthlessly corrupt power responsibly, where profits are privatized while ordinary people bear the burden of high unemployment, impoverishment and loss of fundamental freedoms. It<U+2019>s a kleptocracy run by criminals, complicit with corporate thieves, bribing them to get their way <U+2013> corrupt, rotten to the core gangsterism, run for personal gain, profiting at the public<U+2019>s expense. Bill and Hillary Clinton, America<U+2019>s most notorious crime family, a Machiavellian duo, are heading back to Washington in January for their third co-presidential term, things rigged to assure it. Their excessive corruption rivals how mafia bosses and drug lords amass wealth <U+2013> the old-fashioned way by stealing it, selling influence, and other disreputable means. Corruption is endemic virtually everywhere, likely nowhere more excessively than in America, given the nation<U+2019>s enormous public and private wealth, its distribution as disproportionate as in third world countries, special interests grabbing all they can at the expense of most others. Inside the bubble is paradise <U+2013> outside dystopian hell. America resembles Guatemala, thirdworldized for its privileged few, bipartisan gangsters profiting at the expense of the public they<U+2019>re sworn to serve. Never with Hillary and Bill in charge, addicted to endless wars, predatory capitalism and self-enrichment. WikiLeaks exposed volumes on how they operate.

It provided a detailed look at how the Clintons and their top aides operate. It<U+2019>s not pretty. According to WaPo: <U+201C>Band<U+2019>s memo provided data showing how much money each of Teneo<U+2019>s 20 clients<U+2026>had given to the Clinton Foundation, how much they had paid Bill Clinton<U+2026><U+201D> <U+201C>Band wrote that Teneo partners had raised in excess of $8 million for the foundation and $3 million in paid speaking fees for Bill Clinton.<U+201D> <U+201C>He said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out $66 million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place.<U+201D> One observer called the Band memo <U+201C>the Rosetta stone of the Teneo-Clinton Foundation complex<U+201D> <U+2013> a revenue generating arm for large Foundation donations, along with highly-paid Bill and Hillary speeches, he after leaving the White House, she in 2013 and 2014 after leaving State, before announcing her presidential candidacy.

If it isn<U+2019>t, processes break down and life becomes difficult. Soon there must be a painful reform, or else the civilization will be lost. \nThis is fundamentally the job of families (especially parents), but at the moment that<U+2019>s not really possible: How many families can survive on one income? And if one of the parents can<U+2019>t stay home and teach the fundamental lessons of civilization, who will pass them to the next generation? \nCertainly the better daycare facilities try, but to think that someone watching a couple dozen kids is going to transmit civilization to them as effectively as a parent who<U+2019>s with the child day and night is simply ridiculous. The blame for this rests almost solely at the feet of the state of course, but we<U+2019>re getting ahead of ourselves. \nI<U+2019>ll begin by quoting the redoubtable Fred Reed on the current situation: \nWe live in a dying culture and, soon, a diminished country. It cannot be saved. \nNot true? Add up the bits and pieces. We laugh in horror, some of us, primarily the older, at the decline of schooling, the courses like Batman and the Struggle for Gender Equity. Comic, yes. Yet in aggregate, these constitute an academic and civilizational collapse both profound and irreversible. Enstupidation does not happen in a healthy country. Who even wants to reverse this onrushing night? Not the universities, nor the teacher<U+2019>s unions, nor a professoriat gone as daft as the <U+201C>students,<U+201D> nor the banks battening on student loans [sic]. \nI<U+2019>m more optimistic than Fred in that I think our civilization can be saved. But what he writes is true, and the West<U+2019>s big institutions are simply vampires sucking the blood of a declining civilization. \nI think we can all admit that every major institution of the West, including the mega-corps, is engaged in stripping the Western populace of everything they possibly can. There is no virtue involved, no principle, no honor<U+2026> there<U+2019>s not even much consideration for the future. These outfits, under whatever excuses they<U+2019>re trotting out this year, are strip-mining Western civilization, not building it. \nThat said, let<U+2019>s look at some particular villains. The Political Correctness Barbarians \nWhen I first saw these people rising to power, decades ago now, I thought they were so ridiculous that they<U+2019>d come and go quickly. Unfortunately I was wrong, and they subverted millions of children. The current insanity over <U+201C>safe spaces<U+201D> and such condemns them openly, and especially that it<U+2019>s becoming acceptable to say <U+201C>I hate white people.<U+201D> Anti-Religionists \nIt<U+2019>s one thing to be a simple agnostic. It<U+2019>s quite another to go out and try to dismember religion<U+2026> which in nearly every case means Christianity. And to be honest about it, most people who do this are acting out their personal traumas: either in permanent rebellion to their parents or in anger at one church or another. \nSlashing and burning things simply bears bad fruit, but here<U+2019>s the core issue with attacking Christianity: \nThe people who pushed Christianity out of Western culture were arrogant and destructive <U+2013> not that they pushed it away, but that they never bothered to replace it . \nIf you want to remove the moral core of a civilization, you have to replace it with something better. And the religion-haters did not. They sawed off the limb that held them and were too arrogant to consider the consequences. Academia and the Education Vampires \nThe Enlightenment sits before us as a twisted wreckage. Its destruction followed the usual path: first setting up institutions, then monopolies and fiefdoms, and finally lording it over others as far and as long as they could. \nEducation has whored itself out to the state and treats its students as income-generating tools. Are there a few exceptions? I<U+2019>m sure there are, but they are few. Academia, including most of scientific academia, has disgraced itself. Could any serious Enlightenment thinker have respected <U+201C>scientific consensus<U+201D>? Please! Science places experimentation above all and never ever sells itself to a page full of names and initials! \nThe scientific process has been subjugated by institutions that thrive on restricting access. Cronyism is massive, peer review is corrupted, and the uncredentialed are treated like lepers. These institutions sit atop the corpse of the Enlightenment. Corporatized Art \nThe arts <U+2013> music, film, painting, sculpture <U+2013> are not widgets. They are immensely more important than that, forming minds and cultures in deep ways. \nHow to pay the artist (singer, writer, whatever) has long been a problem and remains one. Hopefully a good answer arises at some point. Until then, seeking profit by dumbing down every art form is simply degrading. \nThe corporations that now control music and film have bastardized art for money. I<U+2019>m not ready to jail them and I certainly don<U+2019>t think the state could do a better job, but I am willing to say that they have disgraced art. Have you ever wondered why elegance is gone? Why loudness and drunkenness are treated as virtues? The State \nBeing that it forcibly skims half of the West<U+2019>s production every year, given that it punishes all who do not obey it, and given that its laws are for sale to the highest bidders, the number one destroyer of Western civilization is the state. Hands down. Think of what people could do for their children and grandchildren with twice as much money. \nAnd don<U+2019>t get me started on enforced charity, the victim culture, <U+201C>you didn<U+2019>t build that,<U+201D> and <U+201C>it takes a village.<U+201D> I don<U+2019>t like to swear in print. A Final Point \nI could go on, but this is a column, not a treatise. My final point is this: \nNone of the above are transmitting civilization, even if some of them once did. They are tools for reaping the masses, and we need to leave them behind. But far more importantly, we need to build methods and systems that will transmit Western civilization. \nThe authentic Western virtues <U+2013> cooperation, initiative, creativity, curiosity, co-dominance, and real justice (not merely a form thereof) <U+2013> are necessary for a prosperous humanity, and the institutions of our time have flamboyantly failed. \nIt<U+2019>s time to start building afresh.

Gangs of migrants armed with clubs and staves prowl the streets of the 10th Arrondissement, Paris, at night. Click to enlarge \nFrench police have tried and failed on many occasions to clear the squalid squat, but asylum seekers simply keep on returning and reestablishing it. \nThere are now nore than 2,500 migrants pitching up in the makeshift camp, with locals saying the eyesore is ruining their businesses and making life a <U+201C>living hell<U+201D>. \nResidents in the once popular district say that the squatters are now becoming increasingly violent and dangerous, with increased reports of muggings. \nFaisal, a shopkeeper, told the French daily Le Figaro that Stalingrad locals are living in fear, threatening the future of his business. \nHe said: <U+201C>The stench of urine, faeces, and rubbish has made Stalingrad an insalubrious place to live. The place is dead <U+2013> no-one wants to come here anymore. People are afraid to go out and lock themselves in. \n<U+201C>I<U+2019>m making less than <U+20AC>60 (<U+00A3>53) a day. A few more weeks like this and I<U+2019>ll go bust! \n<U+201C>French people have been kind to them. I know they<U+2019>re desperate, but the least they can do is respect the law and try and integrate into French society.<U+201D> \nJeanne, another Stalingrad resident, told Le Figaro the migrants had become increasingly violent towards locals. \nShe said: <U+201C>Brazen migrants are snatching jewellery and handbags off passers-by <U+2013> they<U+2019>re even stealing bread. I<U+2019>ve seen them beat people up too.<U+201D> \nPolice have raided the camp some 30 times in the past year, and on Monday French president Fran<U+00E7>ois Hollande vowed to close the camp for good. \nBut within 24 hours of a police operation to move migrants on tents had sprung up again, showing the uphill battle authorities in the French capital face to shut down such illegal encampments. \nFurious locals have demanded that the camp be closed once and for all, describing how they have heard <U+201C>blood-curdling noises<U+201D> coming from it in the middle of the night. \nMarie, who lives right next to the makeshift camp, told Le Figaro: <U+201C>Life here has become unbearable. More than 2,500 squatters were evacuated in September, and now, less than two months later, they<U+2019>re back. And now that the <U+2018>Jungle<U+2019> camp has been closed, things are about to get even worse.<U+201D> \nAnother local, Monique, said that she was at <U+201C>a loss for words<U+201D> and <U+201C>utterly distraught<U+201D> over the situation. \nShe said: <U+201C>The streets are littered with rubbish and faeces.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Editor \n source: theeventchronicle.com \n text: By Tera Graham\nWe spend an overwhelming amount of time in and around buildings; most Americans never leave the comfort of cities, where sizeable structures abound. Yet, rarely do we consider the profound effects architecture has on our everyday experiences. Only standing at the feet of major architectural monuments <U+2014> like the Burj Khalifa in Dubai and the Great Pyramids outside Cairo <U+2014> do we stop and consider how magnificent mankind<U+2019>s ability to build is.\nHowever, more and more scientists are beginning to realize that architecture, like any art form, has the power to influence how we perceive the world. As we learn how architecture can impact our experience of life, we can better control our environments for maximum efficiency <U+2014> and maximum pleasure.\nThe Science and Art of Perception Every second we are awake, our brains track variables like heat, light, odor, noise, and movement to ensure our bodies can continue living. Though we rarely realize it, our minds are always aware of the effects of various environments, and that subconscious perception can dramatically affect our experiences of different places. For example, loud, grating sounds usually make spaces less pleasant, while soft, natural light generally makes spaces more inviting.\nNeuroscientists are increasingly discovering that the brain is constantly making associations, and oftentimes, these links employ metaphors that are grounded in the physical world we perceive. The intangible concept of <U+201C>importance<U+201D> is generally identified as large, though as an idea, it lacks any size or dimension whatsoever. Similar examples are common in language: Our endeavors are completed <U+201C>step by step,<U+201D> as though we are walking the concrete path of our tasks, and being <U+201C>lost in one<U+2019>s thoughts<U+201D> likens deep concentration to exploring a dense forest. It is becoming clear to scientists and artists alike that what we perceive informs what we believe. Fortunately, architects are using this newfound knowledge for the better.\nThe Application of Metaphor Armed with the awareness that our brains are constantly making connections between the corporeal and the conceptual, today<U+2019>s architects strive to generate certain unconscious effects with their buildings. One of the most pervasive trends in modern architecture is the metaphor of the tree.\nTrees have always indicated shelter for humankind: They offer protection from harsh sunlight, from pouring rain, and from dangerous predators. Plus, as humans strive to right their historic environmental wrongs, the tree has become a symbol of sustainability, nature, and health.\nTherefore, several architects are now drawing from trees to create healthful, ecological-seeming buildings. The Kanagawa Institute of Technology in Japan contains a <U+201C>forest<U+201D> of pillars that closely resemble white saplings. In Spain, the Metropol Parasol uses laminated timber to form a sinuous canopy over a popular plaza.\nBy integrating elements of trees <U+2015> trunks, branches, leaves <U+2015> the architects of these buildings have produced not only aesthetically breathtaking structures but also subtly comforting spaces suffused with nuances of nature. Yet, as neuroscience unlocks more of the cognitive impacts of architecture, all structures could have even more powerful metaphor built in.\nThe Future of Cognitive Architecture The cognitive revolution is just getting started, and we are only beginning to understand how our brains and bodies take in the world around us. Experts in neuroscience and architecture alike look forward to advancements that can have beneficial applications in all sorts of structures.\nFor example, nearly everyone has experienced a less-than-ideal working environment. Flickering fluorescent lights, freezing or sweltering temperatures, conflicting design elements, and more can dramatically increase stress amongst a workforce, depleting energy and preventing productivity. When these errors are remedied, the effects of an environment are immediately obvious.\nIn some industries, especially within the industrial sector, we already have sturdy, somewhat more sustainable, buildings that provide benefits workers need: fabric structures . However, in other fields, like health care or education, we eagerly await breakthroughs that demonstrate real impact. With evidence from cognitive science, we can construct hospitals that help patients heal with design and schools that encourage learning through materials and angles.\nThough it happens constantly, perception is an intensely complex task. The spaces around us <U+2015> both the ones we create and the ones governed by nature <U+2015> inform how we live and how we think. Thus, it is imperative that when we construct, we be amply aware of the effects of our constructions: on the environment and on ourselves.\nThis article ( The Real Effects of Architecture on the Mind, Body, and Spirit ) was originally created and published by Waking Times and is published here under a Creative Commons license with attribution to and WakingTimes.com .

Mrs. Clinton is seeing positive signs of enthusiasm in such states as Florida and Nevada. She is also seeing strong turnout rates in the early vote from Latinos and women. But Mr. Trump may have an advantage in the midwestern battlegrounds of Ohio and Iowa, where Democratic voter interest appears to be flagging compared with the 2012 presidential, records show. According to data compiled by the United States Elections Project and the Associated Press, at least 17 million votes had already been cast as of<U+00A0>Friday. Early voting is under way in a number of top-tier battlegrounds including Florida, Nevada, Iowa and North Carolina. Absentee voting has been happening in some form in every state, thanks to laws that require military and overseas ballots to be ready by September. <U+201C>Clinton has opened up a national lead in the polling, and there are some states that have been following that lead in the state polling,<U+201D> said Michael McDonald, who runs the United States Elections Project and is one of the foremost experts on early voting. <U+201C>We can also see similar patterns of movement in the early vote as well.<U+201D> Ballots are secret, but many states release the partisan registration of the voters requesting and returning absentee ballots or voting in-person. While those numbers don<U+2019>t take into account voters who cross over and vote for a candidate of the other party, the early numbers can provide clues into voter enthusiasm and the potential makeup of the electorate. In Florida, Republicans typically have an advantage in early and absentee voting numbers, but this year, the parties are in a virtual dead heat in ballot returns and votes cast. Democrats also cite an increase in female and Latino participation in early voting, with the Clinton campaign using state data to note that 133,000 Latino voters have returned ballots<U+2014>a 99% increase from this point in 2012. Republicans note that the early-voting sites in some GOP-leaning counties aren<U+2019>t yet open. In Nevada, the first week of early and absentee voting showed Democrats ahead by about 25,000 votes on the strength of returns in Clark County, the state<U+2019>s population center that includes Las Vegas. Democrats attribute their strength among the state<U+2019>s Latino voters for the increase. Republicans are running in closer in Washoe County, home to Reno. The GOP is also ahead in absentee ballots statewide. In North Carolina , the number of early voting sites in the state has been reduced since the last election, but participation is about on par with this point in 2012. As of Friday, Democrats led in early voting and absentee-ballot returns in North Carolina by more than 100,000 votes. Despite a strong early performance in 2012, President Barack Obama lost North Carolina that year, and Mrs. Clinton will need big turnout from black voters, who are down as a share of voters in early returns, according to state data. Only a handful of states release data about the gender of early voters, but the figures that are available shows female ballot returns are outpacing male ones, according to numbers compiled by the United States Elections Project. Mrs. Clinton has built her polling lead on her strength with women. Republican operatives say they aren<U+2019>t alarmed by early voting trends in the battleground states, with one Republican National Committee official saying the states the party hopes to win are still within reach. In Iowa and Ohio, early voting points to lackluster Democratic interest rather than a groundswell of Republican enthusiasm. Key counties around Cleveland and Columbus show lower levels of Democratic early voting, Mr. McDonald said. The story is similar in Iowa, where Republicans are flat in terms of ballots requested, at about 175,000, and the 116,000 ballots that have been already cast is down about 11,000 from four years ago. Democrats, however, are down much more, and Mrs. Clinton on Friday headed to Iowa to try to boost those numbers. <U+2014>Dante Chinni contributed to this article.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit yet another record, rising 54.37 points, or 0.3%, to 18923.06. Tech stocks rose 1.3% in the S&P 500, paring their losses since Election Day to 1.8%. Tech companies in the S&P 500 were up 11% this year ahead of the election of Donald Trump as president on Nov. 8, as investors viewed them as winners in the slow-growing global economy. Tech stocks already were trading at relatively high valuations, lessening their appeal at a time when stocks are gaining broadly. As of Nov. 8, the 12-month trailing price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500 tech sector was 20, compared with 18 for the S&P 500. Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. have both dropped 5.7% since Nov. 8, and Google parent Alphabet Inc. has lost 4.5%. The declines also have widened the performance gap between the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow industrials, whose banks and manufacturers have helped the blue-chip index reach four records in the past four sessions. The Nasdaq Composite rebounded Tuesday, adding 57.23 points, or 1.1%, to 5275.62. <U+201C>The markets are still trying to make assumptions about what Trump may be putting in place once he becomes president,<U+201D> said Thomas Wilson, senior investment manager at Brinker Capital. Traders and analysts have several theories about tech<U+2019>s troubles. Some say investors are selling prior winners to buy the new ones, such as financials, which have gained 11% in the S&P 500 since the election. The potential for stricter trade and immigration policies under a Trump administration is also a concern. On Monday and Tuesday, volume surged on bearish options tracking S&P 500 technology stocks. The number of puts on the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund that changed hands Monday was the highest in at least five years, according to Trade Alert data. Meanwhile, bullish call volume on the exchange-traded fund was in line with the average this year. Some selling may be stock-specific. Mr. Trump called out Apple Inc. on the campaign trail in February, for instance, saying consumers should boycott the company after Apple refused to help the U.S. government unlock a killer<U+2019>s iPhone. Apple stock is down 3.6% since the election. Mr. Trump also has spoken about restricting immigration. Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co., said Mr. Trump<U+2019>s immigration plans as president could affect visa programs, making it more difficult for engineering and other tech talent to work in the U.S. Trade limits also could hurt big technology companies that derive a large percentage of their revenues overseas, he said, particularly for companies with large cross-border commerce such as Facebook and Amazon.com. Facebook derives roughly half of its revenue from outside the U.S. and Canada, according to regulatory filings, while the broader S&P 500 derives roughly 30% outside the U.S., according to FactSet estimates. Other potential policies could help the sector, some analysts said. One stance Mr. Trump has promoted is efforts to bring hundreds of billions of dollars that companies hold overseas back to the U.S. through lowered repatriation tax rates. That in turn could create more business spending and potentially more mergers and acquisitions, said Harald Hvideberg, a portfolio manager at Eagle Asset Management in St. Petersburg, Fla. Furthermore, he said the recent swings in technology may not have much to do with the sector<U+2019>s prospects at all. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s a rotation into a lot of industrials, health care, banks, financials that might benefit from rising rates. What do you sell? Maybe you sell something that<U+2019>s done really well,<U+201D> Mr. Hvideberg said. While financial stocks have rallied since Election Day as investors bet on looser regulations and higher interest rates, they rose less than 0.1% in the S&P 500 on Tuesday. Longer-term government bonds extended their slide. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note increased to 2.240%, from 2.224% on Monday, and posted its largest six-day yield gain since December 2010. Yields move inversely to bond prices. Short-term debt fell after data from the Commerce Department showed a rise in October retail sales. The yield on the two-year Treasury note rose to 1.008%, its highest level since Jan. 5 and up from 0.988% Monday. A stronger economy bolsters the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which makes government bonds less appealing to hold. <U+201C>We may be in for a bit of a tussle here,<U+201D> said Scott Colyer, chief executive and chief investment officer of Advisors Asset Management, who added that he expects bond prices will remain lower for the foreseeable future. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of 16 other currencies, rose for a seventh consecutive session, edging up less than 0.1%. <U+2014>Inyoung Hwang contributed to this article.

Voters will decide 162 ballot measures, 71 of them proposed by citizens, according to Ballotpedia, a nonpartisan tracker of election data. The burst of citizen-led measures is likely an indication of frustration with elected officials, said Justine Sarver, executive director of the left-leaning Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. <U+201C>Looking at minimum wage, earned sick leave and other measures, this is a way to express what isn<U+2019>t being accomplished at the state and federal level right now,<U+201D> she said. Most of the measures are being led by Democrats. A record nine states are considering expanding legalized access to marijuana, according to Ballotpedia, with five aiming to legalize it for recreational use and four for medicinal use. Capital Journal is WSJ.com<U+2019>s home for Election 2016 News. The battleground presidential election state of Florida is likely to pass its pot initiative, with polling showing between 60% and 80% of voters favoring the measure there. Voters appear more narrowly divided over the measures in Maine, Arizona and Nevada. Initiatives in the four states considering raising the minimum wage <U+2014>Washington, Maine, Colorado and Arizona<U+2014>are all getting support from voters, leading the <U+201C>no<U+201D> vote by at least 13 percentage points in multiple polls. The Washington and Arizona initiatives also would require employers to establish paid sick leave. Employers are concerned the measures will discourage hiring. On top of the proposed minimum-wage increase, Maine and Washington<U+2014>along with California and Nevada<U+2014>are considering measures that supporters hope could curb gun violence. They include expanding background checks and other measures to stop people believed to be dangerous from having a firearm. Opponents say they would infringe on the rights of weapon owners. Maine and Nevada are considering extending background check requirements beyond transactions at licensed gun dealers. Any transfer of firearms would require a background check through a licensed gun dealer, with exceptions for transfers between family members, for hunting purposes, in the event of danger and other reasons. Washington<U+2019>s initiative would create <U+201C>extreme risk protection orders,<U+201D> which would allow family, household members and law enforcement to request a person demonstrating risky behavior be denied access to firearms. Polls suggest voter support in all four states, the tightest being a 9-point lead for the Maine initiative, according to an October poll by the University of New Hampshire. Californians will vote on whether to require a cap on the amount state agencies can spend on a prescription drug , so they pay no more than the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs pays. The rationale is to keep drug costs low. But in the California secretary of state voter guide, opponents say they fear it could raise prices on prescriptions, including for military veterans who get discounts through the VA. Ballotpedia says opponents of the measure, including drug companies, have outspent its backers by 11 to one. A poll released by Stanford University<U+2019>s Hoover Institution in early October gave the measure 51% support, lower than polls in September from the University of Southern California and the Los Angeles Times, and in July from Tulchin Research. The measure could be the most expensive ballot initiative in 2016. The support campaigns have spent more than $9.2 million and the opposition more than $106 million, according to Ballotpedia.",

Part of the reason is because, despite Clinton<U+2019>s rhetoric, some of her closest allies say she is firmly in the corporate camp and a true free trader who supports NAFTA and TPP.\nIn 2012, Clinton called TPP <U+201C> the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.<U+201D>\nOn October 8, 2015, Clinton reversed her position and said she no longer supported TPP.\nClinton and her staff pushed back on claims that her reversal was political, but a recently released email from Wikileaks shows Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook uncertain about Clinton<U+2019>s position as recently as March 1, 2015, not even a year before the reversal.\nWhen informed on February 28 by White House Director of the Office of Political Strategy and Outreach David Simas that a bipartisan letter was being drafted by former cabinet officials in support of free trade, Mook responded:\nI can<U+2019>t recall where we landed exactly on trade. Is she going to say she supports it? Regardless of her position, signing a letter feels like poking the bear with labor to me.\nEven Clinton<U+2019>s staff didn<U+2019>t now what her position was on trade in 2015? How could someone who had been in public life so long not know their own views?\nThe answer, of course, is that Clinton was likely waiting to see where the polling came out on TPP<U+2014>a deal that largely resembles the one she helped negotiate as secretary of state. TPP does not poll well, especially among progressive Democrats, whom she was going to have to deal with in the then-future presidential primaries.\nThe problem for those opposing TPP is not Clinton<U+2019>s current position, it is whether, as her friends say, she is going to reverse herself again if she becomes president and sign TPP into law.\nThe post TPP: Leaked Emails Show Clinton Staff Unsure of Trade Positions In 2015 appeared first on Shadowproof .\n",

Making the rounds of the<U+00A0>Sunday<U+00A0>shows, Ms. Conway suggested Mr. Romney<U+2019>s harsh critique of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s character and qualifications during the presidential campaign amounted to an unforgivable betrayal of the Republican ticket. <U+201C>There was the Never Trump movement, and there was Gov.

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is also on the list of possible choices to lead the State Department . Ms. Conway was vague as to whether Mr. Trump has blessed her anti-Romney campaign, which began on Twitter last week . Asked by ABC host Martha Raddatz whether she had cleared her attacks with the president-elect, Ms. Conway responded: <U+201C>I won<U+2019>t discuss that.<U+201D> Later she tweeted that she had advised Mr. Trump against Mr. Romney, who was the 2012 Republican presidential candidate. <U+201C>I did tell him privately,<U+201D> she tweeted. <U+201C>And I<U+2019>ll respect his decision.<U+201D> Ms. Conway told CNN<U+2019>s <U+201C>State of the Union<U+201D> that she had been deluged with emails from Trump supporters opposed to the idea of Mr. Romney<U+2019>s serving in the cabinet, an outpouring she described as <U+201C>just breathtaking in scope and intensity.<U+201D> Mr. Romney was among the most-outspoken Trump critics during the election campaign. In March, Mr. Romney gave a pointed speech lambasting Mr. Trump<U+2019>s views and character. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s plenty of evidence that Mr. Trump is a con man, a fake,<U+201D> Mr. Romney said, adding that he is <U+201C>playing the members of the American public for suckers.<U+201D> <U+201C>His domestic policies would lead to recession,<U+201D> Mr. Romney said. <U+201C>His foreign policies would make America and the world less safe. He has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president and his personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill.<U+201D> Some on the right say Mr. Romney<U+2019>s role at State would comfort those worried about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s foreign-policy instincts. <U+201C>He<U+2019>d provide some stability and a calming effect internationally,<U+201D> conservative pundit Erick Erickson tweeted to Ms. Conway last week. <U+201C>Trump would be smart to do it.<U+201D> Ms. Conway, who was Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign manager, said Mr. Trump has already taken steps to placate various factions within the GOP. But she suggested that giving Mr. Romney such a prominent post would be a step too far. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m all for party unity, but I<U+2019>m not sure we have to pay for that with the secretary of state position,<U+201D> she told CNN.

The supply data prompted investors to reduce expectations that two years of oversupply in the oil markets is coming to an end. U.S. prices immediately shed nearly $1 a barrel and losses spread into gasoline and diesel futures. U.S. crude futures fell $1.33, or 2.9%, to $45.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, fell $1.28 a barrel, or 2.7%, to $46.86 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Both posted their seventh loss in eight sessions and lowest settlement since Sept. 27. <U+201C>You could easily make the argument it<U+2019>s the most bearish report of all time,<U+201D> said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division of Mizuho Securities USA. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s nothing to support the market.<U+201D> The U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude-oil stockpiles rose by 14.4 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 28--the largest weekly increase in 34 years of data collected by the EIA. Analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal expected a more modest increase of 1 million barrels. U.S. oil has now fallen 12% in just two weeks since hitting a one-year high on Oct. 19. It is the latest in a series of sharp retreats to hit the market this year every time prices hit around $50 a barrel. Many traders consider that a ceiling because supplies are still so strong, coming from both cost-cutting shale-oil drillers in the U.S. and national oil companies abroad fighting for customers. Traders are skeptical about plans from global exporters to cut production. Russian data released Wednesday showed a new post-Soviet era output record, and U.S. government data showed weekly imports climbed to a four-year high. Oil<U+2019>s sharp fall in recent weeks marks the return of some of the volatility that had characterized the market earlier this summer. Even as equity markets have largely stabilized since March, commodities and currencies have usually kept up their wild swings. This is oil<U+2019>s third retreat from $50 toward $40 within five months, a shift often characterized by moves larger than 10% within just a few weeks. Many other markets had become placid as traders became focused on very few events, and grew certain of both a rate increase coming only in December and the strong likelihood of Hillary Clinton beating Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election, said Alain Bokobza, head of global asset allocation at Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale SA in Paris. But one thing those beliefs did do is spur a dollar rally throughout October, which heaps more volatility on oil markets that are traditionally volatile. A rising dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities like oil more expensive for traders who are based in countries using other currencies, and those commodities often fall as the dollar rises. That often-strong connection went dormant for several months, but appeared to pick up in mid-October when the dollar kept rising and a month-long rally in oil began to reverse. Oil was also highly influenced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which had said in late September it would consider an agreement on output cuts later that year. That made oil one of the few assets impacted by two of the biggest events to captivate the markets, OPEC deal-making and rate decisions coming from the fed. <U+201C>The volatility (in oil) never goes away. It can be high or higher,<U+201D> Mr. Bokobza said. Even bullish traders had been skeptical of OPEC, but many were also pointing to other signs that the oil market had fundamentally changed regardless of what OPEC did. Before last week, U.S. stockpiles had drained seven out of the eight prior weeks, and other major storage hubs showed signs they were falling from record highs, too. It had many bullish traders convinced oversupply may have already ended, extending oil<U+2019>s rally. Last week<U+2019>s record storage addition puts U.S. crude stockpiles now back nearly at the levels they were before that string of drawdowns, about 480 million barrels, according to the EIA. That, combined with continued bickering from OPEC members and uncertainty over the presidential election has caused Gresham Investment Management LLC to sell bullish oil positions this week. <U+201C>The two elements of what lifted prices up are now in question,<U+201D> said Jonathan Berland, managing director at the firm, which manages about $7.8 billion and specializes in commodities. Gasoline futures lost 3.62 cents, or 2.4%, to $1.4479, a one-month low. Diesel futures lost 5.04 cents, or 3.3%, to $1.4665 a gallon, also a one-month low. <U+2014>Alison Sider contributed to this article. Write to Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com",

        "input": "time: null \n author: wmw_admin \n source: thetruthseeker.co.uk \n text: By wmw_admin on November 1, 2016 Michael Snyder <U+2014> The Economic Collapse Oct 30, 2016 \nIn the world of politics, the cover-up is often worse than the original crime. It was his role in the Watergate cover-up that took down Richard Nixon, and now Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s cover-up of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very, very long time. When news broke that the FBI has renewed its investigation into Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s emails, it sent shockwaves throughout the political world . But this time around, we aren<U+2019>t just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents. I haven<U+2019>t heard anyone talking about this, but if the FBI discovers that Hillary Clinton altered, destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the FBI during the original investigation, she could be charged with obstruction of justice. That would immediately end her political career, and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life. \nI have not seen a single news report mention the phrase <U+201C>obstruction of justice<U+201D> yet, but I am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading. The following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice <U+2026> Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsified, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. \nIf Hillary Clinton is sent to prison for 20 years, that would essentially be for the rest of her life. \nI have a feeling that the FBI is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in Huma Abedin<U+2019>s emails. But unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before November 8th, because according to the Wall Street Journal there are approximately 650,000 emails to search through<U+2026> As federal agents prepare to scour roughly 650,000 emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s email use, the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the Justice Department over how to investigate the Democratic presidential nominee. Metadata found on the laptop used by former Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a close Clinton aide, suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that Mrs. Clinton used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter. It will take weeks, at a minimum, to determine whether those messages are work-related from the time Ms. Abedin served with Mrs. Clinton at the State Department; how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the Clinton email probe. \nOf those 650,000 emails, an inside source told Fox News that <U+201C> at least 10,000 <U+201D> would be of interest to the investigation. \nAt this point, FBI officials have not even begun searching through the emails, because a search warrant has not been secured yet. The following comes from CNN <U+2026> Government lawyers haven<U+2019>t yet approached Abedin<U+2019>s lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search. Sources earlier told CNN that those discussions had begun, but the law enforcement officials now say they have not. Either way, government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the computer, the law enforcement officials said. \nBut the FBI is reportedly already searching a laptop that was co-owned by Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin, and no warrant was necessary for that search because Weiner is cooperating with the FBI. \nMany have been wondering why FBI Director James Comey would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day. Surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the election, and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big. In addition, Comey was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the FBI. The following is an excerpt from a Daily Mail article that was written by Ed Klein, the author of a recently released New York Times bestseller about the Clintons entitled <U+201C> Guilty As Sin <U+201C><U+2026> <U+2018>The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn<U+2019>t recommend an indictment against Hillary,<U+2019> said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week. <U+2018>Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,<U+2019> said the source. <U+2018>They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.<U+2019> According to the source, Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice. He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom. \nSo what happens next? \nIn the most likely scenario, the FBI will not have time to complete the investigation and decide whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton before the election. This means that we would go into November 8th with this scandal hanging over the Clinton campaign, and that would seem to be very good news for Donald Trump. \nHowever, it is possible that once the FBI starts searching through these emails that they could come to the conclusion very rapidly that charges against Clinton are warranted, and if that happens we could still see some sort of announcement before election day. \nIn the unlikely event that does happen, we could actually see Hillary Clinton forced out of the race before November 8th. \nOnce again, this appears to be very unlikely at this point, but it is still possible. \nIf Clinton was forced to step aside, the Democrats would need to come up with a new nominee, and that process would take time. In an article later today on The Most Important News I will reveal who I believe that nominee would be. \nIn such a scenario, the Democrats would desperately need time to get their act together, and so we could actually see Barack Obama attempt to delay or suspend the election . The legality of such a move is highly questionable, but Barack Obama has not allowed a little thing like the U.S. Constitution to stop him in the past. \nThis week is going to be exceedingly interesting <U+2013> that is for sure. \nThe craziest election in modern American history just keeps getting crazier, and I have a feeling that even more twists and turns are ahead. \nIt sure seems ironic that Anthony Weiner is playing such a central role this late in the story, and I can<U+2019>t wait to see what is in store for the season finale.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Louis Nelson Louis Nelson Helena Bottemiller Evich Jack Shafer \n source: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/donald-trump-president-231302 \n text: The dueling visions of Donald Trump as president-elect bubbled up once again on Sunday, keeping alive the question of exactly what type of leader the Manhattan billionaire will be when he takes office in January. Trump has largely taken the high road since winning the presidency last week in a historic election that few predicted. Beginning with his victory speech in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, Trump has repeatedly promised to unify a badly divided country after a campaign marked by an unprecedented amount of ugly rhetoric. He has mostly stayed away from the type of personal attacks he so happily lobbed at adversaries and critics throughout his upstart bid. Story Continued Below But flashes of the old Trump have continued to surface, as they did on Sunday, even as he works to come off as presidential. In between celebratory posts to Twitter announcing the fence-mending phone calls he<U+2019>s received from former GOP foes, Trump took time to complain about The New York Times<U+2019> coverage of him and needle the newspaper for missing the movement that catapulted him into the White House. <U+201C>Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the <U+2018>Trump phenomena,<U+2019><U+201D> Trump wrote on Sunday morning, adding in a subsequent post that <U+201C>the @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change <U+2014> doubt it?<U+201D> From there, Trump took a much more pacifying tact on Twitter, announcing that he had received congratulatory phone calls from Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush and former Presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush. He characterized the four phone calls, all from prominent Republicans who did not support his White House bid, as <U+201C>very nice!<U+201D> By Louis Nelson Trump also announced a congratulatory phone call from John Kasich, the Ohio governor who stubbornly refused to endorse Trump and did not attend the Republican National Convention even though it was held in his home state. But the president-elect quickly dipped back into attack mode on Twitter, writing that <U+201C>the @nytimes states today that DJT believes more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.<U+2019> How dishonest are they. I never said this!<U+201D> Trump has previously said that nations like Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia should all have nuclear weapons. The president-elect also shed some light on his approach to what was a foundational issue for his White House run: immigration. During an interview scheduled to air Sunday night on CBS' <U+201C>60 Minutes,<U+201D> Trump stayed away from the hard-line stance he took during the GOP primary, that he would deport every undocumented immigrant currently in the United States. He told CBS reporter Lesley Stahl that he will first seek to deport only those undocumented immigrants with a criminal history, a group Trump estimated to number 2 million or 3 million. <U+201C>What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that they're talking about who are terrific people.\" Trump<U+2019>s team of high-profile surrogates also made the rounds Sunday, walking the same tightrope as the president-elect, balancing bombast with Trump's clear desire to win over at least some of those on the other side of the political aisle who did not support him in the election. Agriculture By Helena Bottemiller Evich Appearing on CBS<U+2019> <U+201C>Face the Nation,<U+201D> longtime supporter Newt Gingrich said Trump must <U+201C>swing for the fences<U+201D> in his first 12 months in office, warning him to have a <U+201C>very, very aggressive first year<U+201D> because <U+201C>the swamp doesn't want to be drained. And the swamp will just suck you in if you let it.<U+201D> But Gingrich also said Trump must seek bipartisan support for his package of proposals once he takes office, recommending that he partner with incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on a massive infrastructure project. Seeking such cooperation would ensure that Trump<U+2019>s legacy will be protected against the kind of undoing that many of President Barack Obama<U+2019>s initiatives are likely to face once Trump takes control of the White House, the former House speaker said. <U+201C>I think it's very important that Trump try to have as many Democrats as possible help him do this,<U+201D> Gingrich said. <U+201C>Because one of the lessons of the Obama years is: If you do things that are big on a purely partisan basis, they're not stable. I mean, I think Trump wants to change America to make it great again for a generation. Not just for eight years.<U+201D> Talking about the Washington swamp that Trump so famously promised to drain, the president-elect<U+2019>s former campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told <U+201C>Fox News Sunday<U+201D> that his supporters should pay no attention to the fact that the presidential transition team has been stocked with exactly the type of political insiders he railed against in his stump speeches. Familiar faces like Gingrich, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) all serve as vice chairmen of the Trump transition team<U+2019>s executive committee, and a collection of lobbyists have already begun advising the real estate mogul. But Trump<U+2019>s supporters have no reason to worry, Conway said, proclaiming: <U+201C>The gravy train is about to have its wheels blown off and its engine completely ripped from its bearings.<U+201D> <U+201C>Look, these are people who are talented and have done this before. You can't just appoint novices; you have to have people who know what they're doing, but at the same time moving forward this is an administration that's going to run very differently than typical Washington,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>Finally, the voters got what they wanted, what they've been begging for for 30 years, which is give us the opportunity, give us a person who actually represents the outsider, non-Washington, business-experienced type of profile, somebody who goes to Washington owing nobody anything.<U+201D> 2016 By POLITICO MAGAZINE Giuliani, who last week called protesters demonstrating against Trump<U+2019>s election on college campuses across the country <U+201C>crybabies,<U+201D> said Sunday on ABC<U+2019>s <U+201C>This Week<U+201D> that the president-elect<U+2019>s team is sympathetic to their concerns. He said Trump has a clear mandate by virtue of his commanding Electoral College win, regardless of the fact that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, because <U+201C>the Constitution of the United States doesn<U+2019>t change the powers of the president based on the number by which you get elected.<U+201D> The former New York mayor, widely rumored to be under consideration to become either attorney general or secretary of homeland security, said protesters have banged on his car window as he arrived at Trump Tower in the days since the election. He called on those demonstrating <U+201C>to please respect the democratic process<U+201D> and praised President Barack Obama and Clinton for their graciousness in defeat. Still, he said they should do more to speak out against those protests that have turned violent, for which Giuliani said there should be zero tolerance. <U+201C>I think we understand [protesters'] frustration. We certainly don<U+2019>t want to make it worse. I think they<U+2019>re exaggerating the fears of a Donald Trump presidency because they<U+2019>re coming off a campaign where they<U+2019>re very disappointed,<U+201D> Giuliani said. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m sure our supporters would have been very disappointed had Donald Trump not won. And I just hope it calms down.<U+201D> By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

U.S. crude futures rose 29 cents, or 0.65%, to $45.27 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, rose 32 cents or 0.7%, to $46.36 a barrel. Crude prices plunged along with the broader market as investors fled from risky assets in the immediate aftermath of Donald Trump <U+2019>s surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election, but tides turned as the stock market bounced back. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s a euphoria in the market and people are buying,<U+201D> said Mark Waggoner, president of Excel Futures. <U+201C>People were sitting on the sidelines, and are now jumping in.<U+201D> Crude wavered between gains and losses in choppy trading earlier in the day. Prices fell following new federal data that showed U.S. oil stockpiles swelled more than expected and producers kept pumping before following the stock market higher. U.S. crude prices rebounded from a seven-week low over $43 a barrel Tuesday night to their highest settlement value in a week. <U+201C>Once we established a new weekly high, you got some buying and short covering,<U+201D> said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group. U.S. inventories of crude oil rose by 2.43 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 4, according to the Energy Information Administration. That is above the 900,000 barrel increase forecast by analysts and traders surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, but less than the sizable 4.4 million barrel build reported Tuesday night by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group. <U+201C>It perpetuates the build situation, but it<U+2019>s not as bearish as API,<U+201D> said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division for Mizuho Securities USA. Still, Mr. Yawger said the weekly data is <U+201C>not the most important thing for the next 48 hours because of the election curveball we<U+2019>ve been pitched.<U+201D> Wednesday<U+2019>s data comes a week after a record 14.4 million barrel increase in stockpiles last week<U+2014>the largest weekly addition in 34 years of federal data. Total stockpiles of crude oil and refined products fell by 7 million barrels. Gasoline supplies fell by 2.841 million barrels, compared with a 600,000 barrel draw forecast by analysts and traders. Analysts attributed the draw in part to the disruption of the Colonial Pipeline, a major fuel conduit from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast that was offline most of last week following an explosion. Diesel supplies fell by 1.948 million barrels. Gasoline futures lost 1.2 cents, or 0.88%, to $1.3572 a gallon. Diesel futures were flat at $1.4411 a gallon. Energy experts are still weighing what Mr. Trump<U+2019>s foreign and energy policies could mean for oil markets in the long term. Some said he would be likely to scale back regulations and facilitate more drilling<U+2014>policies that U.S. energy firms would favor. But others cautioned that such policies could end up keeping oil prices low by unleashing more supply into a world already awash in crude. <U+201C>It probably ends up not being all that supportive for prices because supply will be ample,<U+201D> said Bill O<U+2019>Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management. <U+201C>But the oil companies themselves will be thrilled.<U+201D> <U+2014>Kevin Baxter contributed to this article Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com",

You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. First, I encourage you to check our Opinion report frequently throughout the day. Our Op-Ed columnists and contributors will be writing all day about the results. Now, let me tell you how I plan to watch election night: I start the night believing that the polls are correct and that Hillary Clinton is poised to win by roughly the same comfortable Electoral College margin as President Obama did in 2012. All night, I<U+2019>ll be looking for ( and worried about ) signs that the polls are wrong. For starters, I<U+2019>ll be checking the prediction markets at PredictWise pretty frequently. Donald Trump starts the day with an 11 percent chance of victory. If that starts to change, it means bettors are seeing signs <U+2014> such as exit polls or turnout numbers <U+2014> that they consider meaningful. Once polls start closing, I<U+2019>ll largely ignore Virginia (where polls close at 7 p.m., and all times here are Eastern) at first, because it counts votes slowly and Democrats always trail early. Instead, I<U+2019>ll look to Florida (8 p.m.) and North Carolina (7:30 p.m.). They both had a lot of early voting, which means they can report results quickly. Trump needs Florida if not both states. Next, I<U+2019>ll turn to the states Clinton should be winning, like Pennsylvania (8 p.m.), Michigan (polls start closing at 8 p.m.) , Wisconsin (9 p.m.), Colorado (9 p.m.), Nevada (10 p.m.). The most plausible razor-thin Clinton victory has her winning all of those as well as Virginia (while losing New Hampshire, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina). If she can pick off Florida, Ohio or North Carolina early in the night, the outcome could be clear by 9 p.m. As for the Senate, I<U+2019>ll be writing down these eight states (in descending order of Democratic victory odds), and keeping in mind that the Democrats need at least five, plus the vice presidency, to take control: Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Hampshire, Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana.

A chief concern is that his election could imperil progress in long-running efforts to stem the problem of sexual assault in the U.S. military. <U+201C>This behavior renders him utterly unworthy of being commander in chief and president,<U+201D> said the open letter signed by 55 general and flag officers and provided to The Wall Street Journal. <U+201C>If given such power, Donald Trump would create a command climate intolerant of women and incompatible with a trained, ready and honorable military.<U+201D> The signatories include three retired four-star generals, nine three-star officers, and one- and two-star officers, along with some more junior officers from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Army National Guard. <U+201C>The American people deserve better than a misogynist in chief. Donald Trump<U+2019>s behavior is antithetical to American values,<U+201D> they wrote. The group decried Mr. Trump<U+2019>s behavior toward women and his attitude toward sexual assault in the wake of a video that surfaced earlier this month in which Mr. Trump boasted about groping women . The retired officers said they believe that if he were elected, he would significantly set back progress made on sexual assault issues inside the military in recent years. The U.S. military has struggled with sexual assault for years. Under pressure from Congress and acting on their own, Pentagon leaders have attempted to curb the problem by implementing new reporting procedures, increasing awareness and investigating complaints more aggressively. But the military continues to be plagued by high rates of sexual assault. The total number of reported cases has grown to just over 6,000 across the services in 2015, according to Defense Department data. That growth is attributed in part to enhanced reporting techniques. Those signing the letter include many retired senior officers who are well-known within military circles. The letter was signed by Marine leaders, such as Lt. Gen. Walter Gaskin, Lt. Gen. John Castellaw and Lt. Gen. Willie Williams, all retired, as well as Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling and Army Lt. Gen. Donald Kerrick. Signers also include Air Force Lt. Gen. Arlen Jameson and Vice Adm. Donald Arthur. A handful of women were among the officers who signed the letter, including Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, who retired in 2000 after 32 years in the Army. She was the first woman to attain the three-star rank in the Army. Gen. Kennedy said in an interview that she had personal reasons for signing. She said she first was assaulted when she was a young lieutenant and again as a field grade officer. As a two-star general in the late 1990s, Gen. Kennedy recalled a business meeting in her office with an officer who was junior in rank to her. When the meeting concluded, he pulled her forcibly toward him and groped her. <U+201C>The biggest thing we can do is get it out in the open and out of the shadows,<U+201D> she said in the interview. <U+201C>Nobody is keeping any secrets here.<U+201D> The retired officers decided on their own to write the letter, Gen. Kennedy said. There was no immediate response from Mr. Trump<U+2019>s aides to the letter, which hasn<U+2019>t been provided to the campaign. Write to Gordon Lubold at Gordon.Lubold@wsj.com",

It<U+2019>s everyone who loves the idea of America. Like the Irish, for example. Or the French.

You<U+2019>re fired.<U+201D> The video continues on, with Bono asking the video monitor if Trump was talking about band members The Edge, Larry Mullen Jr. and Adam Clayton when he said, <U+201C>You know what they used to do guys like that?

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: russia-insider.com \n text: Hacking Accusations Against Russia Are Sign of Washington's Desperation \nWith Putin winning across the board, Washington is struggling to contain its humilitation Originally appeared at Strategic Culture Foundation \nThe Obama administration is now accusing Russia of cyber-crime and trying to disrupt the US presidential election. The claim is so far-fetched, it is hardly credible. More credible is that the US is reeling from Putin<U+2019>s stunning humiliation earlier this week. \nSince June, US media and supporters of Democrat presidential contender Hillary Clinton have been blaming Russian state-sponsored hackers for breaking into the Democratic party<U+2019>s database. \nIt is further alleged that Moscow is stealthily trying to influence the outcome of the election, by releasing damaging information on Clinton, which might favor Republican candidate Donald Trump. \nRussia has vehemently denied any connection to the cyber-crime charges, or trying to disrupt the November poll. \nNow the Obama administration has stepped into the fray by openly accusing Russia. <U+00AB>US government officially accuses Russia of hacking campaign to interfere with elections<U+00BB>, reported the Washington Post. \nThis takes the row to a whole new level. No longer are the insinuations a matter of private, partisan opinion. The US government is officially labelling the Russian state for cyber-crime and political subversion. \nPredictably, following the latest allegations, there are calls among American lawmakers for ramping up more economic sanctions against Russia. While US intelligence figures are urging for retaliatory cyber-attacks on Russian government facilities. \nVladimir Putin<U+2019>s spokesman Dmitry Peskov derided the US claims as <U+00AB>rubbish<U+00BB>. He noted that the Kremlin<U+2019>s computer system incurs hundreds of hacking attempts every day, many of which can be traced to American origin, but Moscow doesn<U+2019>t turn around and blame the US government for such cyber-attacks. \nThere are several signs that the latest brouhaha out of Washington is a bogus diversion. \nAs with previous Russian-hacker claims by the Democrats and US media, there is no evidence presented by the Obama administration to support its grave allegations against the Russian government. Assertion without facts does not meet a minimal standard of proof. \nWhen reports emerged in June <U+2013> again through the Washington Post <U+2013> that the Democrat National Committee (DNC) was hacked by Russian agents, the allegation relied on investigations by a private cyber security firm by the name of CrowdStrike. The firm is linked by personnel to the NATO-affiliated, anti-Russian think tank Atlantic Council. Again no verifiable evidence was presented then, just the word of a dubious partisan source. \nBack then the Russian scare story, for that<U+2019>s what it was, served as a useful diversion from far more important issues. Such as the 19,000 emails released from the DNC database showing that the party chiefs had preordained Clinton<U+2019>s presidential nomination over her Democrat rival Bernie Sanders. Much-vaunted <U+00AB>US democracy<U+00BB> was exposed as a fraud, and so the Washington establishment quickly went into damage-limitation mode by smearing Russia. \nIt was the whistleblower site Wikileaks, run by Australian journalist Julian Assange, that released the embarrassing emails. It had nothing to do with Russia. Assange has since hinted that his source was within the Democrat party itself. \nThis is where it gets really explosive. Assange has vowed to release more emails that will prove that Clinton as Secretary of State back in 2011-2012 masterminded the supply of weapons and money to Islamist terror networks in Libya and Syria for the objective of regime change. Furthermore, Assange says that the emails prove that Clinton lied under oath to Congress when she denied in 2013 that she was had any involvement in facilitating arms to the jihadists. \nAssange has said that Wikileaks is going to publish the incriminating emails on Clinton<U+2019>s alleged gun-running to terrorists this month. If the evidence stands up, Clinton could be prosecuted for perjury as well as treason in aiding and abetting official terrorist enemies of the US. \nThe exposure of an American presidential candidate as being involved in state sponsorship of terrorism while serving as a top government official is a powerful incentive for the Obama administration to find a lurid diversion. \nHence, the latest charges by the US government against Russia as perpetrating cyber-crime and of trying to subvert American democracy. \nThis is just one more illustration of how irrational and unhinged the US government has become. \nDay by day, it seems, leads to more damning revelations of Washington<U+2019>s complicity in illegal wars, covert subversion of foreign states, and systematic collusion with terrorist networks which have inflicted thousands of deaths on American citizens, among many more thousands of other innocent civilians around the world. \nIn addition to exposure by sources like Wikileaks, much of revelation about US criminality and state-sponsored banditry has emerged from Russia<U+2019>s principled military intervention in Syria. Russia<U+2019>s intervention has not only helped salvage the Syrian nation from a foreign conspiracy of covert war for regime change. Russia<U+2019>s intervention has also brought into clear focus the systematic links between Washington and its terrorist proxy army working on its behalf in Syria. \nWashington<U+2019>s mask of moral and legal superiority has been ripped from its face. And what the world is seeing is the vile ugliness beneath. \nSuch is Washington<U+2019>s ignominious fall from pretend-grace to its grim, odious reality that Vladimir Putin this week was empowered to speak from the moral high ground. \nIn announcing Russia<U+2019>s unilateral suspension of a 2002 accord with the US for the disposal of nuclear-weapon-grade plutonium, Putin went much, much further. He gave Washington a list of ultimatums that included the US ending its trumped-up sanctions against Russia, with financial compensation, as well as the scaling back of NATO forces from Russia<U+2019>s border. \nIn other words, the Russian leader was talking truth to American power in a way that megalomaniac Washington, with all its ridiculous delusions of <U+00AB>exceptionalism<U+00BB>, has never ever heard before. \nAmerican pretensions of greatness are eroding like a castle built on sand. Washington<U+2019>s criminal enterprises and specifically the complicity in terrorism for the supreme crime of foreign aggression are being glaringly exposed. \nAnd now with due contempt, Russia is putting manners on Washington. It must be excruciating the humiliation for the narcissistic American tyrant to be treated with the disrespect that it deserves and which is long overdue. \nMoreover, the humiliation is not just in the eyes of the world. The American people can see the true ugly nature of their rulers too. When a giant banner declaring <U+00AB>Putin a peacemaker<U+00BB> was unfurled off Manhattan bridge in New York City this weekend, the popular enthusiasm went viral. \nWashington is reeling from Putin<U+2019>s righteous courage to call it out for what it is. The truth-telling is hard to take for this unipolar unicorn. Its deluded myth-making about its own virtues are being stripped bare. \nWhat<U+2019>s going on here is a world-class, historic exposure of American power as a nefarious excrescence on humanity. \nThe reaction is understandable: foaming-at-the-mouth, desperate, hysterical and panicked. Accusing Russia of hacking into the American <U+00AB>democratic process<U+00BB> is a wild attempt to divert from the paramount issues: Washington<U+2019>s exposed descent into a vile morass of its own making; the emperor is a criminal; the people know it; and a genuine world leader like Vladimir Putin has the temerity to lay it on the line to this has-been.",

Mandates are in the news this week, in more ways than one. ObamaCare<U+2019>s 2017 sticker shock prompted CNN to track down Jonathan Gruber, the ObamaCare <U+201C>architect<U+201D> last seen crediting <U+201C>the stupidity of the American voter<U+201D> for the passage of the so-called Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. <U+201C>ObamaCare<U+2019>s not imploding,<U+201D> Gruber told CNN<U+2019>s Carol Costello Wednesday. He elaborated at some length, but she wasn<U+2019>t completely buying it. <U+201C>OK,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>So let<U+2019>s talk about how exactly you can fix ObamaCare.<U+201D> His reply: Meanwhile, some liberal commentators are starting to worry that if (or, as they would have it, when) Hillary Clinton is elected president 11 days hence, she won<U+2019>t have a mandate. As the New Yorker<U+2019>s Ryan Lizza puts it, Mrs. Clinton may be <U+201C>on track<U+201D> for a landslide, <U+201C>but it<U+2019>s not entirely clear that Americans will be voting for<U+201D> her. She has <U+201C>lower favorability ratings than any major-party nominee in history,<U+201D> save only for Donald Trump. Follow James on Twitter Since she would have won largely <U+201C>by successfully disqualifying her opponent,<U+201D> the GOP <U+201C>will quickly argue that her election was not a referendum on her immigration-reform plan, her infrastructure spending ideas, or her childcare and family-leave proposals.<U+201D> If Republicans hold majorities in Congress, as still seems likely in the House at least, they will claim that Americans <U+201C>voted for congressional Republicans to serve as a brake on her agenda.<U+201D> Let us pause here to note the disjunction between the two political meanings of <U+201C>mandate.<U+201D> For an ordinary citizen, a mandate is a burden, something the government is forcing him to do. For a politician, a mandate is a license to do what he wishes. Some of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s supporters are already getting aggressive in defending her against the no-mandate claim. The other day MSNBC<U+2019>s Chris Hayes tweeted: <U+201C>If Clinton wins, from day one the GOP<U+2019>s contention will be that she is illegitimate. Trump was a fluke and she has no mandate.<U+201D> Commentary<U+2019>s John Podhoretz promptly toppled that straw man: <U+201C>Having no mandate and being illegitimate are two different things and you shouldn<U+2019>t conflate them unless you want to HARM OUR DEMOCRACY.<U+201D> The New York Times<U+2019>s Frank Bruni has a column boldly titled <U+201C>Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s Resounding Mandate.<U+201D> He acknowledges that <U+201C>her election might not be any validation of her prescriptions for health care, the Middle East or trade.<U+201D> So what<U+2019>s the mandate? To sum it up, Mrs. Clinton would have a mandate to be not Trump<U+2014>more specifically, not to be obnoxious like Trump. That shouldn<U+2019>t be that hard, but her <U+201C>deplorables<U+201D> digression<U+2014>let<U+2019>s remember, she also called them <U+201C>irredeemable<U+201D> and <U+201C>not America<U+201D><U+2014>raises questions about whether she even has it in her to do that. Resounding! New York<U+2019>s Jonathan Chait argued two months ago that the whole mandate question is overblown: That<U+2019>s true as far as it goes, but why should we think the Republicans would <U+201C>almost certainly<U+201D> win back the house majority in 2018 if they lose it this year? Yes, the president<U+2019>s party usually loses congressional seats in midterm elections, but there have been exceptions, in 1998 and 2002. Who<U+2019>s to say Mrs. Clinton and congressional Democrats couldn<U+2019>t govern from the center and hold or even expand their (still-hypothetical) majorities? Chait seems to assume they wouldn<U+2019>t do that<U+2014>that Mrs. Clinton would overreach her mandate and voters would punish her for it two years hence. Which is, of course, what President Obama, along with the Democratic congressional majorities, did in 2009-10. It seems fair to say that while Obama might have had a mandate, even a resounding one, after his victory in 2008, that mandate did not extend to the imposition of <U+201C>comprehensive health-care reform.<U+201D> Polls during and since that period, as well as the 2010 election results, make clear that ObamaCare<U+2019>s enactment was against the wishes of most of the electorate. Even Chait, still an ObamaCare cheerleader, admitted as much this week in a piece titled <U+201C> Obamacare Is a Policy Triumph and a Political Failure .<U+201D> True, <U+201C>comprehensive health-care reform<U+201D> was an Obama 2008 campaign promise. But during that year<U+2019>s primaries, he and Mrs. Clinton differed on what turned out to be ObamaCare<U+2019>s central feature<U+2014>and he was the one who opposed it. <U+201C>What<U+2019>s she not telling you about her health-care plan?<U+201D> asked an April 2008 Obama ad quoted by NewsMax in 2012. <U+201C>It forces everyone to buy insurance, even if you can<U+2019>t afford it, and you pay a penalty if you don<U+2019>t.<U+201D> At the very least, Obama did not come to office with a mandate for the mandate.

Why would the president of the United States do such a thing, even in jest? <U+201C>I was reading the other day there is a guy on the radio who apparently <U+2014> Trump<U+2019>s on his show frequently <U+2014> he said me and Hillary are demons,<U+201D> Mr. Obama explained to the laughing crowd. <U+201C>Said we smelled like sulfur. Ain<U+2019>t that something?<U+201D> He then lifted his hand, took a sniff, and broke into a broad grin. <U+201C>Now, I mean, come on people!<U+201D> The radio host in question was Alex Jones, who on Monday called Hillary Clinton <U+201C>an abject psychopathic demon from hell<U+201D> who was bent on destroying the planet. <U+201C>She<U+2019>s so dark now and so evil and so possessed<U+201D> that her very presence inflicts nightmares upon those in close physical proximity to her, he said. <U+201C>I been told this by high up folks and they tell me Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur,<U+201D> he said in his trademark style, a kind of shout that mixes bombast and panic. <U+201C>They smell like hell.<U+201D> Mr. Obama may laugh off Mr. Jones fire-and-brimstone rantings, but many people do not. He is an influential, if fringe, conservative figure whose radio show, videos and websites peddle conspiracy theories to an audience of millions. Here is a brief introduction. Where Does He Work? Mr. Jones is based in Texas, where he hosts The Alex Jones Show, a nationally syndicated talk show, and runs Infowars, a website he founded that offers an angry and histrionic take on the day<U+2019>s news. He has been called <U+201C>the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America<U+201D> by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. The Alex Jones Show says it is broadcast on 160 radio stations, but his influence is perhaps most keenly felt on the internet. More than 1.6 million people have subscribed to his YouTube channel, where video clips from his show have been watched almost one billion times since 2008. Another 1.2 million people have liked his Facebook page and over 470,000 follow him on Twitter . Mr. Jones has had several bursts of mainstream attention. In 2011 he aired an interview with Charlie Sheen that led to the actor<U+2019>s dismissal from the sitcom <U+201C>Two and a Half Men.<U+201D> Two years later he started an online petition to deport the CNN host Piers Morgan , a British citizen, from the United States because of his advocacy of gun control laws. Mr. Morgan invited Mr. Jones onto his show to debate gun control, but it quickly devolved into more than 10 minutes of red-faced screaming by Mr. Jones, who affected a British accent and called Mr. Morgan <U+201C>a hatchet man of the New World Order.<U+201D> <U+201C>I am here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms,<U+201D> he yelled. <U+201C>Doesn<U+2019>t matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken, we will not relinquish them. Do you understand?<U+201D> What Does He Believe? Mr. Jones has described himself as a libertarian. Many of his views mix traditional conservative critiques of government with wild-eyed delusions about globe-spanning conspiracies. His main focus is a supposed liberal plot to seize people<U+2019>s guns and install a tyrannical world government. There is almost no major news event that Mr. Jones has not woven into that conspiracy narrative . He argues that the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the Oklahoma City bombing were <U+201C>inside jobs<U+201D> committed by rogue elements of the <U+201C>military industrial complex.<U+201D> He says the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax perpetrated by forces hostile to the Second Amendment. The list goes on. Mr. Jones argued in 2013 that same-sex marriage was a <U+201C>eugenicist globalist<U+201D> plot <U+201C>to encourage the breakdown of the family<U+201D> and <U+201C>get rid of God<U+201D> so the state can reign supreme. <U+201C>Not because they<U+2019>re atheists, but because they want the state to be God,<U+201D> he said. How Does He Fit Into the Presidential Race? Mr. Jones is a fervent supporter of Donald J. Trump , who appeared on The Alex Jones Show for a 30-minute interview in December 2015. <U+201C>What you are doing is epic, it<U+2019>s George Washington level,<U+201D> Mr. Jones told Mr. Trump. Mr. Jones enthusiastically endorsed Mr. Trump<U+2019>s positions on immigration and terrorism and at the end of the interview the Republican candidate praised the host for his integrity. <U+201C>Your reputation is amazing,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said. <U+201C>I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope. And I think we<U+2019>ll be speaking a lot.<U+201D> Has Hillary Clinton Addressed His Claims? Yes, she has. Mrs. Clinton condemned Mr. Jones during a speech in August that criticized Mr. Trump for his support among the <U+201C>alt-right,<U+201D> a radical group of conspiracy theorists and white nationalists on the fringe of the conservative movement. She compared his radio show to The National Enquirer and called his claims that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax <U+201C>disgusting.<U+201D> <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t know what happens in somebody<U+2019>s mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that, but Trump doesn<U+2019>t challenge these lies,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton said. For Mr. Jones, though, all publicity seems to be good publicity. Hours after Mrs. Clinton spoke, his show ran a long segment on her criticisms. He denied much of what she said but basked in her attention, using her remarks as an opportunity to portray himself as a noble warrior for the truth. <U+201C>She attacked the resistance to her takeover of this country by foreign banks, the Saudi Arabian government, the Communist Chinese and others,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>She<U+2019>s in deep trouble.<U+201D> Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the First Draft newsletter .",

Trump. A veteran of the real estate industry for several decades now, Trump surely has renovated his share of properties, buildings and even golf courses. His latest project, however, could be his most ambitious: the Bill of Rights itself. \n\"Look at this thing,\" The Donald said as he held a copy the seminal American document before a crowd of reporters. \"It's old. I mean, it's old, like really old. You hear what I'm saying? It is old.\" \nWhen asked what his intentions for the document were, Trump proposed a \"renovation\" of the foundational document \"just like he would any of [his] older buildings that didn't cut the mustard anymore. I mean, Ivana wasn't cutting it anymore, so I got Marla Maples. New is better. I think we all know that, new is better. New equals better. Sometimes you have to tear something down to make something new, right? And then it's all better.\" \nWhen asked what he specifically meant by \"tearing down the document\" that is the basis of this country's inalienable rights, Trump continued, \"Hey look, I don't know when this thing was written, probably a long time ago, like in the 1920's or something, but it doesn't make any sense anymore. I have a real problem with an old, stinky document telling me how to live my life. If we're gonna make America great again, the first thing we have to do is make these document new again, and that's what I'm gonna do on the first day in office. Bingo-bango, new document for the new America. I mean, really, no one reads this stuff anymore.\" \nThe presidential hopeful was then asked how he planned to rejuvenate the Bill of Rights. \"First of all some of this spooky language needs to get cleaned up. Like how is a working-class guy like me, the average citizen, supposed to understand this stuff? The trial of all crimes (except in cases of impeachment, and in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when in actual service in time of War or public danger) shall be by an Impartial Jury of the Vicinage, with the requisite of unanimity for conviction, the right of challenge, and other accostomed [sic] requisites; and no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherways [sic] infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury; but if a crime be committed in a place in the possession of an enemy, or<U+2026> blah, blah, blah. Vicinage? That's not even a word, is it? Unanimity? Impeachment? These aren't words like hammer, dumptruck or bigly. They're talking in circles. That's right, they're talking in circles. So that one's gone. Just out. Accostomed? Otherways? These Founding Father clowns can't even spell!\" \nTrump's furor grew as he read more of the document. \"Freedom of religion? No one goes to church anymore. Who cares? That one's going too. All it does is protect these Muslims who blew up buildings. God forbid they blow up my towers. That's out. Freedom of speech? Freedom to lie, that's what I call it. Freedom to lie, like those bastards on CNN and Hillary over there. This seventh here, that's a doozy. It says in \"all matters involving more than 20 dollars\". That's a joke. I tip 20 dollars at Starbucks when I get my coffee. That one's out. \"Due process of law\" <U+2026> another joke. Out! This third one, \"quartering soldiers,\" what's that? I have waaaay too much respect for our soldiers to start chopping them up into quarters. I mean, that's like serial killer stuff, right? No, absolutely not, I will not chop up soldiers. On my first day in office, I will find anyone who is trying to chop up American soldiers and make them pay.\" \nWhen prompted that he may be misinterpreting the articles in the Bill, Trump lashed back. \"Of course I am! Look at it some time. Who can understand this stuff? Of course I'm misinterpreting this stuff. Maybe this is how they talked in the 1920's, but not now, not in Trump's America. And the ideas are just stupid. Look at this fourth one. No illegal \"search and seizure\"? If I can't walk into someone's house and arrest him, how am I gonna maintain law and order? If I can't just take someone's stuff, how am I gonna know what's going on in this country, huh? You tell me. And this old piece of paper is trying to tell me when I'm president - not if but when - I'm gonna restore law and order. This fourth one, how many shootings in Chicago happened because my police have their hands tied by this stupid fourth amendment. I mean, that's what I'm gonna do, starting on the first day of my term. The very first day. Here's another peach: no \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" What's that? How else do you deal with terrorists? That's why we got soft. These terrorists knew they could come over, bombs some buildings, kill a bunch of people and know this piece of paper was gonna make sure they didn't get their precious feeling hurt. First day in office, that one's out!\" \nOne reporter asked The Donald if he knew that the \"stinky, old\" document he was holding was supposed to protect the American people from injustice, and false legal claims. (He was also asked if he knew what \"quartered\" meant). \"Hey, I'm not saying people don't have rights. People have rights. Of course people have rights. Sure they do. I'm just saying they don't need all this stuff. The first day I'm in office, the very first day, I'm gonna make a nice simple list of rights, you know, without all this fancy nonsense. It's outdated. We need something for 2016, something nice and simple.\" \nTrump then said he had to meet with his team of architects and engineers to draw up plans for a wall along the southern border of the US, which he would start building on his \"very first day in office.\" Make Chris Dahl's day - give this story five thumbs-up (there's no need to register , the thumbs are just down there!)",

That return shows a giant net operating loss (NOL) of $916 million from the turmoil that engulfed Mr. Trump in the early 1990s. This loss Mr. Trump may<U+2014> may <U+2014>have used to offset his prodigious TV and licensing earnings in later years. It was Mr. Giuliani, in a case that hasn<U+2019>t stood the test of time, who indicted Michael Milken and brought down Drexel Burnham Lambert, collapsing the junk-bond market on which Mr. Trump was depending to refinance his then-tottering, recession-battered empire of Atlantic City casinos, New York<U+2019>s Plaza Hotel and the Eastern Airlines Shuttle (renamed Trump Shuttle). Trump properties began missing debt payments, some of which Mr. Trump personally guaranteed. By early 1992, Businessweek estimated that Mr. Trump was personally underwater by $1.4 billion. A good 15 years later, Dale Black, CFO of Trump Entertainment Resorts, was still admitting that <U+201C>absent a large change in income, we<U+2019>re not going to pay cash taxes for the foreseeable future with the NOLs that we have.<U+201D> It didn<U+2019>t help. Last year the company was back in bankruptcy, though Mr. Trump<U+2019>s stake by now had been whittled down to 10% (and that mostly in exchange for continued use of his name and likeness). Now owned by Carl Icahn, the last Trump-era casino in Atlantic City<U+2014>the Taj Mahal<U+2014>is finally slated for permanent closure this coming Monday. Books have been written about the Trump casino disaster. It used to be the press<U+2019>s business to check out claims. Now it<U+2019>s satisfied to trumpet the possibility that Mr. Trump used the losses to offset his income-tax liability in later years. It<U+2019>s all part of a show, ably directed by the Clinton campaign, whose theme is not only that Mr. Trump is unfit to be president, but you are d<U+00E9>class<U+00E9>, a lowlife, a sucker if you vote for him. But it<U+2019>s also true that Mr. Trump hasn<U+2019>t done even a passable job of late. To the observation (allegation? complaint?) that he received a loan from his father, how does he not say, Yes, that<U+2019>s how businesses get started in America, with loans from family and friends. How does he fail to mention that his companies, even when losing millions of dollars, continue to generate payroll, franchise, property, sales and personal income taxes for government? How does he not point out that a Miss Universe pageant winner has a job to do<U+2014>remain beautiful<U+2014>and the inability to refrain from binge-consuming sweets is not a personal virtue or act of gender heroism. How do these answers not come instantly, naturally, to the lips of a business person, whatever his aversion to rehearsal? Mr. Trump<U+2019>s lack of preparation has been notable but points to a deeper question: his level of commitment. Mrs. Clinton, in addition to being ambitious, undoubtedly feels a powerful obligation to work hard, guard her speech, control her impulses because she has to look in the face the friends, supporters and donors over many years who brought her to this place. Mr. Trump still depends mostly on himself. He enjoys winging it but it<U+2019>s also easier<U+2014>i.e., less work. As backer Newt Gingrich told the New York Times on Monday, at this late date, Mr. Trump <U+201C>will have to decide whether he cares enough about the presidency.<U+201D> Mr. Trump may well have used the giant tax losses from his ambitious-builder phase to shield his earnings from his later business model of generating royalties by impersonating a celebrity tycoon. But it<U+2019>s this latter career that made him a presidential candidate. A president is a frontman for his administration<U+2019>s priorities, selling them to the people, the Congress, the bureaucracy. That<U+2019>s the skill set the public wants. And notice one thing you haven<U+2019>t heard from Mr. Trump, whose business is defining the public<U+2019>s mood and then aligning himself with it. He<U+2019>s the only politician who hasn<U+2019>t joined the hooey over the overblown Wells Fargo robo-selling fiasco. He has been silent amid the endless hearings in which senators and House members seek to outdo each other in denouncing Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf. What you see in these hearings is our betters terrified, petrified lest anybody accuse them of going easy on a bank chieftain. Look closely. If the United States ever falls to a Hitler or Mussolini, it won<U+2019>t be because a Hitler or Mussolini turns up. It<U+2019>s the mob that makes the dictator<U+2014>a mob mostly consisting of elites falling over themselves to get on board with any injustice, travesty or idiotic distraction as long as it preserves their meal tickets and status. In the meantime, we have our democracy. If voters want to see if it can still deliver, maybe the only realistic choice today is to give a Republican Congress a Republican president to sign its bills. For the first time in a while, at least it will be clear whom to hold accountable for the results.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Laura Meckler Richard Rubin \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-proposes-a-new-tax-break-1476158462 \n text: Democrat Hillary Clinton, hoping to win over skeptical and struggling voters, is proposing a new tax cut that would give an additional $1,000 a year or more to millions of parents of young children. The timing of the proposal appeared to be calculated to deliver maximum political benefit and to appeal to voters who have turned away from her Republican rival, Donald Trump, but haven<U+2019>t embraced Mrs. Clinton. It<U+2019>s part of a larger plan for middle-class tax cuts. The new plan would double the child tax credit to $2,000 per child for families with children ages 4 and under. The Democratic presidential nominee also would change the rules so more people with particularly low incomes would benefit, even if they don<U+2019>t owe income taxes. The new Clinton tax break is structured as a refundable tax credit, which delivers the biggest benefits to lower- and middle-class families, including those who owe no income taxes. That<U+2019>s a contrast to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s child-care plan , which delivers the bulk of its benefit as a deduction, which is worth more to taxpayers in higher tax brackets. The Clinton campaign estimated the cost of the proposal at $150 billion to $200 billion over 10 years and said it would be funded by higher taxes on the wealthy already put forth. <U+201C>Rich people ought to be paying more federal income taxes to pay their fair share for our country,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton said Monday at a rally in Detroit. The Trump plan would increase taxes on about eight million families, according to one estimate, because he repeals certain tax benefits particularly for single parents. The Trump campaign disputes this conclusion and said it would ensure no household pays more. The result of the Clinton plan would be an increase in the number of households that don<U+2019>t pay any income taxes, something many Republicans have criticized. Still, there is some bipartisan support for expanding the child tax credit, with Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) suggesting a similar idea during his presidential campaign. The proposal comes at a time when Mr. Trump is facing fallout from a video where he speaks about women in vulgar terms. Mrs. Clinton has scored hits attacking Mr. Trump but has struggled to draw attention for her agenda. She has delivered speeches in recent weeks on her faith, her work for children and families and a proposal for national service, but her campaign is vexed by how to break through. <U+201C>When you<U+2019>re running against [Mr. Trump] and he generates so much controversy and therefore headlines, it<U+2019>s hard to break through on any one day. And that<U+2019>s why we just have to keep at it,<U+201D> Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said Monday. The Clinton campaign described the new proposal on the child tax credit as a <U+201C>down payment on her overall vision for tax relief for middle-class families.<U+201D> Aides said she eventually wants to expand the tax credit for families with older children, and to make more refundable tax credits available to low-income workers without children. Mrs. Clinton has also proposed new tax credits for people with particularly high out-of-pocket, health-care costs and for families caring for parents and grandparents. Under current law, married couples who earn less than $110,000 a year qualify for a $1,000 tax credit per child under age 17. The credit phases out as income increases. Single parents also qualify, with lower income thresholds. Mrs. Clinton would expand that credit in two ways. She would increase the value of it for young children. And she would change the rules so the tax code would no longer exclude the first $3,000 in earnings in determining whether a family is eligible for the tax break for children of all ages. The plan is aimed at helping families with children, but wouldn<U+2019>t necessarily generate economic growth, said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank that promotes free enterprise. Lowering overall tax rates would spread the benefit to taxpayers without children. <U+201C>If your goal instead is to offer financial assistance to parents of children, then this is a policy you want to turn to,<U+201D> Mr. Strain said. He noted that the credit delivers cash to families, letting them decide how to spend it, versus subsidizing child care, which directs the dollars to child-care providers. Mr. Strain said his concern about Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s plan is that it comes in addition to proposals to increase child-care subsidies, expand paid family leave and provide assistance for college tuition. <U+201C>This seems like just trying to turn every knob and pull on every lever in the arsenal,<U+201D> he said.",

WSJ Pro Private Equity has profiled nearly a dozen current and former deal makers with ties to the Trump campaign who could be poised to help shape the next administration<U+2019>s agenda. This second installment of a two-part series spotlights six of those individuals. (See the first part of the series here .) Dallas businessman Ray Washburne, a finance vice-chair of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s inaugural committee and reportedly in the running for interior secretary, is chief executive of Charter Holdings, which invests in private equity, real estate and restaurants. A major Republican fundraiser, he also managed finances for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie<U+2019>s presidential run. Charter Holdings owns MCrowd Restaurant Group Inc., which includes Mexican cuisine chains Taco Diner and Mi Cocina, as well as upscale Texas eatery The Mercury. His firm also owns Highland Park Village, an upscale Dallas shopping mall. <U+2014>Chris Cumming Chairman of the presidential inaugural committee, Thomas Barrack Jr., who founded Los Angeles distressed real-estate and private-equity firm Colony Capital Inc., is a familiar face on the Trump team, having been a major fundraiser for the candidate and a speaker at the Republican National Convention. The two men have personal and professional ties stretching more than three decades and have worked on a number of real-estate deals together, beginning in 1988, when Mr. Barrack negotiated the sale of the Plaza Hotel in New York to Mr. Trump. As with Mr. Trump, Mr. Barrack<U+2019>s interests spill over from real estate into show business. He was chairman of film studio Miramax LLC, which an investor group led by Colony acquired in 2010 and sold in June, and his firm also owns a stake in Michael Jackson<U+2019>s Neverland Ranch. Alongside his friend, actor Rob Lowe, he created a fund to invest in entertainment properties, and in 2010, bailed out photographer Annie Liebovitz with a $24 million debt deal through Colony. <U+2014>Chris Cumming William Hagerty, the director for presidential appointments for transition planning, is considered by some to be closer to the Republican establishment than many in Mr. Trump<U+2019>s inner circle. Mr. Hagerty is an old hand on presidential transitions, having served in the same position for the planned succession of Mitt Romney, whom he had known since early in their careers in finance. Mr. Hagerty also was the national finance chairman for Mr. Romney<U+2019>s 2008 presidential bid, a policy adviser to President George H.W. Bush and, until 2015, commissioner of economic development for his home state of Tennessee. After leaving the Bush White House staff, Mr. Hagerty began his career in private equity with Trident Capital, where he helped launch early online mapping company MapQuest Inc., before co-founding private-equity firm and merchant bank Hagerty Peterson & Co. <U+2014>Chris Cumming After Mr. Trump stopped self-financing his campaign, Republican National Committee Finance Chairman Lewis Eisenberg became a major fundraising force for the presidential contender. The former co-founder and co-head of investment firm Granite Capital International Group LP was tapped to lead the <U+201C>Trump Victory<U+201D> fund and worked closely with Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign finance chair, to build the fundraising apparatus. Mr. Eisenberg is now a finance co-chair of the presidential inaugural committee. The former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. veteran executive has known Mr. Trump for more than three decades, and was floated as a possible candidate for commerce secretary. Mr. Eisenberg is also a longtime friend of Henry Kravis and George Roberts, the two cousins who co-founded KKR & Co. He was tapped in 2009 as a senior adviser to the private-equity firm. Mr. Eisenberg was chair of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey at the time of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001. He became a board member of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., which was created to rebuild lower Manhattan in the aftermath of Sept. 11, and chaired the victims<U+2019> families and transportation advisory councils. <U+2014>Dawn Lim Elliott Broidy is chief executive of his namesake Los Angeles investment firm, Broidy Capital Management, and a finance vice chairman of the presidential inaugural committee for Mr. Trump. He has sat on the board of governors for the California Israel Chamber of Commerce, a not-for-profit group that aims to forge ties between the business communities of California and Israel. He founded Markstone Capital, an Israeli-focused private-equity firm, in 2002, but resigned from the firm in 2009. He came under scrutiny when then New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo conducted probes into pension pay-to-play schemes. In 2009, Mr. Broidy reached a civil settlement with the New York Attorney General<U+2019>s office for providing free travel and other perks to state officials to reward commitments of pension money to Markstone Capital. In 2012, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of attempting to reward official misconduct. <U+2014>Dawn Lim Thomas Hicks Jr. is a partner at Hicks Holdings, the Dallas family office launched by his father, the elder Thomas Hicks who was the co-founder of leveraged buyout firm Hicks Muse Tate & Furst. Known as Tommy, Mr. Hicks is a longtime friend to some of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s children, said a person familiar with the matter. He volunteered for a role in the presidential campaign after Mr. Trump emerged as the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party, the person said. Mr. Hicks was national finance co-chair of Donald J. Trump for President, the presidential campaign organization, and is a finance vice chair on the presidential inauguration committee. Mr. Hicks has been at Hicks Holdings since its launch in 2005. The family office held stakes in the Texas Rangers baseball club and other sports businesses about a decade ago, but has shifted into other sectors, investing in companies such as Just Brakes, a car-maintenance business, and H-D Advanced Manufacturing Co., which makes precision-engineered parts. <U+2014>Dawn Lim Amplification: This article has been updated to reflect Mr. Eisenberg<U+2019>s current roles.

Gov. Rick Scott , a Republican, declined on Thursday to extend the deadline after a call from Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s presidential campaign to accommodate people disrupted by the storm. <U+201C>Everybody has had a lot of time to register,<U+201D> Mr. Scott told reporters in Tallahassee. With the registration deadline on Tuesday, the storm caused Democratic-leaning groups to put off plans for registration drives, which typically draw a surge of new voters in the final days before registration ends. About 50,000 people registered in the last five days before the cutoff in 2012, according to Daniel A. Smith , an elections expert at the University of Florida. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign manager, Robby Mook, asked for more time to sign up new voters in Florida, the most contested of all battleground states. <U+201C>Our hope would be that a little bit more time will be given for people who were expecting to be able to get registered before the election,<U+201D> Mr. Mook said on Thursday. <U+201C>We certainly expect that the governor and local officials will make that possible.<U+201D> Both Republicans and Democrats in Florida, a state that President Obama won by a mere 74,000 votes in 2012, have aggressively sought to add more of their supporters to the rolls this year. Republican registration has increased by 265,501 through August, and Democrats added 213,094, according to the state Division of Elections . Democrats accused Mr. Scott, who helps run a <U+201C>super PAC<U+201D> that supports Donald J. Trump , of playing politics with his decision not to extend the registration deadline. But a spokeswoman for the governor, Jackie Schutz, fired back in The Miami Herald, <U+201C>For any political party to ask this in the middle of a storm is political.<U+201D> Meanwhile, Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, a Republican, extended voter registration in her state, also in the path of Hurricane Matthew, beyond the original Saturday deadline. Heavily populated South Florida avoided a direct hit by the storm, although more than 500,000 people in the state were without power, the governor said in a news conference.

Interestingly, it is not by any means persuasive propaganda. It would have been far more effective in the 20 th century than today when so many more people are beginning to be educated about free-market economics. \nMore: \nDonald Trump has accused the Federal Reserve of keeping interest rates too low for what is healthy for the economy in order to make the Obama administration, and by extension Hillary Clinton, look good. Theresa May, more elegantly but no more justifiably, used her party Conservative party conference speech to attack the Bank of England<U+2019>s policy of quantitative easing. \nIn both cases, the technocrats at central banks are accused of making policy that helps rich elites and hurts the more deserving common people, be they small savers or hardworking families. \nSo far so good. But toward the end of the article we are <U+2013> unfortunately for the argument <U+2013> provided with more specifics. This is where the article<U+2019>s logic weakens and then disintegrates. \nA cursory search of <U+201C>populism<U+201D> or <U+201C>populism vs. globalism<U+201D> will reveal a tremendous amount of commentary in a short period of time. In fact, this particular dominant social theme seems to be a foundational feature of upcoming arguments in favor of globalism. \nBut it is fatally flawed <U+2013> as this article offers in a few sentences that are meant to be damning but instead reveal the basic bankruptcy of this rhetorical approach: \nTraditionally, populists have berated central banks for their obsession with <U+201C>sound money<U+201D>: tight monetary policy, high interest rates and the gold standard. <U+00A8> \nIn about 25 words, the article seems to sabotage its entire argument and by extension the larger meme. \nIs this the best that can be done? Probably so. It provides terrible testimony as to the state of elite memes generally. \nFor one thing, central bank criticism in the past few decades has not focused on central bank <U+201C>obsession with sound money.<U+201D> \nOn the contrary, most modern criticism regarding central banking focuses on the endless debasement of the fiat currency monetary facilities spew relentlessly. \nAdditionally, critics of central banking in the past decade or more have been sounding the alarm regularly about too-low interest rates. Rates so low, in fact, that they have now gone into negative territory. \nFinally, in addition to mischaracterizing modern central bank criticism, the article doesn<U+2019>t even attempt to grapple with cogent criticisms of central banking that are common on the Internet today. \nThese criticisms are rooted in the free-market economics of the Austrian School, which is in many ways the basis of all modern economics. \nMarginal utility shows us clearly that markets create valid prices. Yet central banks <U+201C>fix<U+201D> the value and volume of money via interest rates and in other ways. \nThis cognitive dissonance is at the heart of the disaster of modern central banking. \nAsk a central banker if he believes in price fixing, and you should receive a credible, necessary response: Price fixing destroys prosperity by substituting dictates for market competition. And yet <U+2026> price-fixing is central banking<U+2019>s significant <U+2013> sole <U+2013> methodology. \nIn the Internet era, memes have to be convincing and logical to have an impact with the intelligentsia that elites have traditionally sought to propagandize <U+2013> as they are thought leaders. But here we have one of the most important dominant social themes <U+2013> populism vs. globalism <U+2013> being presented in a major financial newspaper in a most unpersuasive way. \nThis is probably why the fallback position when it comes to reasserting a necessary matrix of elite propaganda increasingly focuses on censorship. \nThe kind of comprehensive effort necessary to reestablish the once-commonly accepted disinformation of the 20 th century is probably beyond the scope of even the most authoritarian propagandizing short of genocide. \nConclusion: Bur wait, is that a potential world war staining the horizon? <U+2026>",

Not only are they engaged in illegal acts concerning voter registration , but now they have ruined the good name of Cliven Bundy by sending out 700,000 mailers to households throughout Nevada and contaminating the jury pool, which has led the defense to call on the court to <U+201C>change the venue<U+201D> so that Bundy might receive a fair trial. \nThe flyer reads, <U+201C>This man<U+2019>s armed standoff led to the deaths of two Las Vegas Police Officers and he<U+2019>s supported by Congressman Hardy.<U+201D> It also contains Cliven Bundy<U+2019>s name and mug shot in front of a row of prison cells. This was also paid for by the Nevada State Democratic Party. \nAttorney for journalist Pete Santilli , Chris Rasmussen, joined with Nevada<U+2019>s public defenders in a motion to compel the court for a <U+201C>change of venue.<U+201D> Rasmussen received one of the flyers and entered it into evidence with the court claiming that Bundy would not receive a fair trial due to the obvious propaganda sent out by the State of Nevada. \nThis story about tying the Bundy<U+2019>s or anyone at Bundy Ranch to Jared and Amanda Miller, the Las Vegas shooters , is bogus. By his own account, Miller was sent home from Bundy Ranch . Here<U+2019>s Miller<U+2019>s comment to a YouTube video claiming that very thing. \nIn fact, the media jumped all over the false narrative that Miller and his wife were tied to the Bundy<U+2019>s, labeling them right wing extremist terrorists , and attempting to use the propaganda for advancing attacks on the Second Amendment . The media never mentioned the fact that the Millers were involved in the Occupy Movement and it never informed the public that they were Vegas police informants . \nWhat<U+2019>s worse is that this attempt to smear patriots for standing against the illegal and unconstitutional acts of the DC government and their willing accomplices in the Bureau of Land Management , FBI, and corrupt politicians, both in DC and local, is the fact that this was already dealt with once as Constitutional Sheriff Richard Mack was wrongly connected to the Millers. \nDeb Jordan adds , <U+201C>Las Vegas Metro Police and the Clark County Sheriff<U+2019>s Department cannot produce any report of violence or destruction of property during the Bundy Civil Rights Protest, except in those instances where the Bureau of Land Management were the perpetrators.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>Sheriff Douglas Gillespie, the then Sheriff of Clarke County said at the time, there was no direct link to the couple<U+2019>s killing spree and Cliven Bundy <U+2013> noting that the two had arrived in Las Vegas in January of 2014 and that they had their own agenda for starting a revolution,<U+201D> she added. <U+201C>Gillespie made clear he had seen NO evidence that the Miller<U+2019>s had come to Nevada seeking out Cliven Bundy.<U+201D> \nNevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore also took time to call out this injustice . \n<U+201C>This mailer is completely unacceptable she said, and somebody needs to be held accountable for putting this false narrative in Nevada mailboxes,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>Clearly the Bundy<U+2019>s Civil Rights were being violated by a United States Government <U+2013> Terrorist Organization <U+2013> known as the BLM, and we all saw it happening with our own eyes. I was not the only elected official at that protest and what I want to know is, where the hell are they now?<U+201D> \nFiore also said : \nThe level of propaganda being allowed by the Democratic Party must come to an end. We have men whose lives are on the line here in Nevada, and poisoning the jury pool with a downright lie must be dealt with. Not only do we have a case here that is already out of balance because it is being overseen by Judge Gloria Navarro, a left winger who was recommended by Harry Reid and appointed by Barack Obama, and Steven Myhre a Liberal Prosecutor who could obviously care less about fairness and truth, now we add to that more unfairness by allowing a left-wing propaganda machine to send out the message, that Cliven Bundy is directly responsible for the death of two of our Metro Police officers. \nThis case should be awarded a change in venue in the fairness of law, and my peers should stop being cowards and get back to representing the truth about this case. \nCliven Bundy held a peaceful protest on his own property and even though the Federal Government was not invited, they came anyway. \nThey literally beat up on his family, set trained snipers on hillsides overlooking his ranch, came at them with stun guns and dogs, tried to restrict them to a first amendment area, killed and buried their cattle on public lands <U+2013> in mass graves, threatened everyone who came to a lawful protest with lethal force, had armed helicopters and drones flying all over the place, and now they honestly want the American people to believe the Bundy<U+2019>s were the bad guys <U+2014> come on <U+2026> \nThe Government has stacked the odds against these men, and I am telling you right now; \nI will not stand by and watch them be railroaded by a bunch of left-wing extremist and sent to prison for crimes they did not commit. \nThis case should not only be moved out of the State of Nevada, it should be dismissed altogether. \nI have no regrets for doing the right thing here when it comes to the Bundy<U+2019>s <U+2014> As hard as it is, I would rather lose every single race for office, before I would lose one nights sleep knowing I had betrayed them .<U+201D> \nFiore is correct. The men in Nevada were more peaceful than the agents who surrounded them. So, what are you going to do America? Will you sit quietly by at your keyboard and rage at the machine, or will you take action? \nYou can contact the responsible party here: Address : 6233 Dean Martin Dr, Las Vegas, NV 89118",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Mac Slavo \n source: libertynews.com \n text: by Mac Slavo \nIn the runup to the 2016 election Matt Drudge linked to reports that Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s health was faltering. For weeks the <U+2018>rumors<U+2019> were denied by mainstream media , especially left-leaning web sites. \nAs the election drew closer, The Huffington Post and other partisan web sites claimed that Clinton had an unbeatable lead. On November 4th, just days before the election, HuffPost went so far as to suggest that Clinton had a 98% chance of winning the election. All the while, alternative media researchers, journalists, commentators and bloggers were highlighting the fact that polls actually showed a dead even race , with Trump leading in some cases. \nWhen Wikileaks released tens of thousands of emails, the propaganda went into full swing with claims that the emails sourced from the DNC and Clinton Campaign were fake, even though numerous third-party organizations certified their validity. \nIf you were to ask the experts, Drudge Report , Infowars , Breitbart , The Daily Sheeple , Stone Cold Truth , SGT Report , Alt-Market , Daisy Luther , TruthStream Media and scores of other alternative news websites were peddling fiction. In fact, <U+201C>peddling fiction<U+201D> is the exact terminology used by President Obama to marginalize the detailed economic reports being disseminated by Alternative Financial websites like Zero Hedge . \nThe fiction narrative, first championed by entrenched media personalities, was pushed across social media by millions of anxious Hillary fans. According to them, everything coming from independent media was a lie <U+2013> it was fake. \nAs it turns out, Clinton<U+2019>s health problems were confirmed when she was recorded stumbling and wobbling following a September 11th ceremony in New York. The Wikileaks were, in fact legit. Trump won by an electoral landslide. And the economy continues its downward spiral. \nOne report after another being disseminated by what left-leaning pundits call <U+201C>fake news websites<U+201D> has been confirmed as accurate, proving that there was a concerted effort to stifle open discourse and real journalism. \nHillary Clinton made mention of it in her Deplorables speech, warning that a lot of fake information was being released through purported <U+201C>racist<U+201D> websites across the web. \nAnd if she had her way, no one would have ever read anything but positive information about her, while everything else was disappeared Orwellian-style, never to reach the masses that eventually elected Donald Trump to the Presidency. \nWhat this year<U+2019>s Presidential election has proven is that alternative media is a force to be reckoned with, and the establishment is scared shitless. \nBut they won<U+2019>t let it happen again. \nEarlier this year President Obama turned control of the internet over to the United Nations, effectively eliminating free speech protections enjoyed by citizen journalists in America. It may have sounded crazy when we sounded the alarm before the internet takeover, but today<U+2019>s actions by Google and Facebook provide further evidence that the establishment media and Deep State politicians are preparing a digital lock down on any and all information that has not been approved by an as of yet unknown Truth Panel. \nA Facebook spokesman said it will explicitly ban sites that traffic in fake news from using the Facebook Audience Network, saying they fall under the category of misleading, illegal or deceptive sites already barred. The audience network places ads on other websites and mobile apps. \nEarlier Monday, Google said it plans to prevent Google ads from being placed <U+201C>on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher<U+2019>s content, or the primary purpose<U+201D> of the website. The policy would cover sites that distribute false news, a Google spokeswoman said. False news stories, particularly those that spread widely on Facebook, became an issue during the recent presidential election. Google experienced its own mishap on Sunday when a story on a right-wing blog erroneously stating Donald Trump won the popular vote appeared atop some Google search results. \n<U+2026> \n<U+201C>While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news,<U+201D> the Facebook spokesman said. <U+201C>We vigorously enforce our policies and take swift action against sites and apps that are found to be in violation. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.<U+201D> \nFull report \nThe moves by Google and Facebook follow a recent de-monitzation effort at Youtube that has also targeted alternative media. As noted in their <U+201C>Advertiser Friendly Content Guidelines,<U+201D> they appear to be targeting exactly the issues often covered by alternative media by directly banning: \nC ontent that is considered <U+201C>not advertiser-friendly<U+201D> includes, but is not limited to: Controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown \nSo basically, anything newsworthy is no longer advertiser friendly, and these organizations will now determine whose news will or won<U+2019>t be seen based on what is sure to be proprietary algorithms and secretive human curation. \nThe bottom line is this: the time and energy required to produce the amount of video content and investigative journalism that we saw during the election is astronomical. Thousands of journalists, bloggers and concerned citizens spent countless hours reporting the news the mainstream media wouldn<U+2019>t. Many of those people depend on advertising revenue to cover their most basic website maintenance costs, as well as their monthly mortgages and the food they put on their dinner tables. \nThe aim with policies like this, which will no doubt be overseen by establishment hacks, is to quite literally starve independent media. In turn, they will starve the people of the information they so desperately need to understand what is being done to them. \nThis is only the beginning. The lockdown will continue. Previous Story",

Barnes \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-seeks-ways-to-assert-itself-on-global-issues-in-wake-of-u-s-election-1479078247 \n text: BRUSSELS<U+2014>Foreign ministers from the European Union said the bloc would stand by its key foreign-policy positions on issues including the Iranian nuclear deal, Russia<U+2019>s annexation of Crimea and climate change, but vowed to work with the new U.S. administration. Meeting to discuss the fallout from Donald Trump <U+2019>s victory in the presidential election , the bloc<U+2019>s foreign ministers said they would seek to reinforce Europe<U+2019>s voice on security issues and other key policies. But they said they would work speedily to deepen contacts with the Trump transition team and seek out Mr. Trump<U+2019>s foreign-policy ideas and plans. EU foreign-policy chief Federica Mogherini said the U.S. is, for Europe, a <U+201C>key, indispensable partner.<U+201D> However, she told reporters late Sunday that <U+201C>it<U+2019>s not up to us but it<U+2019>s going to be up to the next U.S. administration to define their own positions. We have clear in mind what our positions are both in terms of EU interests and in terms of EU principles.<U+201D> Ms. Mogherini invited EU foreign ministers to Sunday<U+2019>s dinner discussion on U.S.-EU relations hours after Mr. Trump<U+2019>s win in Tuesday<U+2019>s vote. The EU worked closely with the Obama administration and most in Europe had expected an election win by Mr. Obama<U+2019>s former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump during the election campaign suggested at some points the U.S. might not unconditionally defend all North Atlantic Treaty Organization members, a position that would upend European security. He has also criticized the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement and suggested he is seeking warmer ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Senior European diplomats say the bottom line is that for the first time in decades, leading European governments have little idea what the next U.S. president<U+2019>s foreign policy will look like. There are almost no strong ties between top European leaders and Mr. Trump or his advisers, although the president-elect has spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Fran<U+00E7>ois Hollande in recent days. Ms. Mogherini said the EU wouldn't shift its position on upholding the Iranian nuclear deal and the Paris climate-change agreement, calling these accords key European interests. Foreign ministers on Monday will issue a statement on Iran, which will reiterate their strong support for the full implementation of the 2015 nuclear deal. Ms. Mogherini also underlined that the EU has pursued engagement with Mr. Putin on a number of international issues. However, she said the bloc has <U+201C>a very principled position on the illegal annexation of Crimea and the situation in Ukraine. This is not going to change regardless of possible shifts in others<U+2019> policies.<U+201D> The EU, like the U.S., has imposed broad sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine. Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said after the meeting that there was no sense of panic but it was important for the bloc to prepare for possible changes in U.S. policy. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s a democratically elected president. We<U+2019>ll judge him on his acts. But of course he<U+2019>s a candidate who says <U+2018>America First,<U+2019> who said he wants to cooperate a bit less than before, who seems to want a different relationship with the Russian Federation. We<U+2019>ll have to see whether that happens,<U+201D> he said. Sunday evening<U+2019>s meeting has proved contentious in the bloc. Over the weekend, several foreign ministers said they wouldn<U+2019>t attend, among them, the U.K.<U+2019>s Boris Johnson and Hungary<U+2019>s Peter Szijjarto. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault also missed the meeting. French officials put that down to his travel schedule but noted they saw little need for a crisis meeting at a time when there was no crisis. Asked about Mr. Johnson<U+2019>s absence, Ms. Mogherini said it didn't come as much of a surprise. <U+201C>I guess it<U+2019>s only normal for a country that has decided to leave the European Union not to be so interested in the future of our relations with<U+201D> the U.S., she said. Ms. Mogherini has gathered EU foreign and defense officials in Brussels this week to discuss her plans to push forward with expanded security and defense policies. Mr. Trump has been critical of Europe for spending too little on its own defense. He has suggested that U.S. support for its allies could be contingent on countries stepping up their spending. This year, Ms. Mogherini crafted a paper calling for <U+201C>strategic autonomy<U+201D> for Europe. The plan has moved slowly amid disagreements among members over the shape of a military headquarters and how best to build up European defense capability. Still, diplomats have said Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election may give Ms. Mogherini<U+2019>s plans a boost. <U+201C>Whatever the U.S. administration, we have known for a long time that Europe must reinforce its actions in the realm of security and defense. But it<U+2019>s also perhaps true on the themes of trade, migration and climate change,<U+201D> Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders told reporters on Sunday. <U+2014> Matthias Verbergt in Stockholm contributed to this article Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com and Julian E.

Everywhere I go, people are babbling about Mike Pence and Tim Kaine! Who knew it would be so electric? The world can<U+2019>t stop talking about Veep Vitriol. O.K., I made that up. I<U+2019>m sorry. Nobody is talking about the vice-presidential debate at all. This was really just a sneaky way to introduce the subject of apologies. It came up in the debate, during an argument over who had the most <U+201C>insult-driven campaign.<U+201D> Pence saw an opening to mention that Hillary Clinton had once described half of Donald Trump<U+2019>s followers as a racist, sexist, homophobic <U+201C>basket of deplorables.<U+201D> Kaine retorted that at least Clinton had apologized. Which is true. Clinton said she regretted being <U+201C>grossly generalistic, and that<U+2019>s never a good idea.<U+201D> It would have worked if she had not prefaced her original <U+201C>deplorables<U+201D> remark <U+2014> made at a private fund-raising event <U+2014> with, <U+201C>To just be grossly generalistic <U+2026><U+201D> You can<U+2019>t say you<U+2019>re sorry for something you admitted was wrong when you were saying it. Clinton needs new material. A truly sincere apology would probably have been something along the lines of: <U+201C>I deeply regret having said something at an off-the-record fund-raiser that I wouldn<U+2019>t want taped and broadcast to the world. You<U+2019>d think everybody would have learned that lesson by now.<U+201D> Still, certainly not the worst apology of the era. That might have been the time a radical rebel group in Syria put up a statement expressing regret for having beheaded the wrong person. Also, possibly former Cincinnati Reds star Pete Rose<U+2019>s ongoing attempt to apologize for his seamy past by selling balls on which he<U+2019>d written <U+201C>I<U+2019>m sorry I bet on baseball<U+201D> for $300 and up. (Cincinnati still has a downtown street called Pete Rose Way, which illustrates the importance of not naming major pieces of infrastructure after people who are still alive. I always found it amusing until I ran across New York<U+2019>s Donald J. Trump State Park.) But about apologies: Other rules include not blaming the problem on the hearer (<U+201C>I<U+2019>m sorry if you guys were offended<U+201D>). And not using your apology to repeat the original infraction. Perhaps you remember the former owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, who apologized for making racist statements about Magic Johnson in an interview during which he told Anderson Cooper <U+201C>some of the African-Americans, they don<U+2019>t want to help anybody.<U+201D> We need a president who will know just the right thing to say if our drones accidentally hit somebody<U+2019>s presidential palace, or the new ambassador to France gets drunk and demands to know why Parisians aren<U+2019>t friendly. Clinton<U+2019>s own apology record is mixed, although lately her comments on the emails have been sounding less like expressions of regret for having been caught. On this point, like so very many in the current campaign, Clinton<U+2019>s failings tend to vanish when compared with the behavior of her opponent. If you<U+2019>re having an argument about who does an apology better, it<U+2019>s not much of a contest when one of the two parties doesn<U+2019>t seem to ever admit he was wrong about anything. A Trumpian apology would be the thing he did recently in Washington, when he retracted years of birtherism by blurting out <U+201C>President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period.<U+201D> Then trying to claim he had done the president a favor by pushing the matter so hard. Then blaming the whole thing on Hillary at the end of a promo for his new hotel. People, we are being deprived of our God-given right to complain about both presidential candidates. Every time someone comes up with a Hillary flaw, someone else will do a comparison. Yeah, while Clinton was secretary of state the Clinton Foundation took money from foreign bigwigs to help fund its work with impoverished people overseas. But the other guy spent his charity<U+2019>s money on a six-foot portrait of himself. Any more questions? For Trump surrogates like Pence, the best response is to deny the original offense ever occurred. During the debate, Kaine pointed out that Trump had said women who seek an abortion should be punished. Hard to deny, given the fact that he made the comment on MSNBC. But Pence said Trump <U+201C>would never support legislation<U+201D> along that line. And it<U+2019>s true that hours after the MSNBC taping, the Trump campaign issued a statement saying he only wanted to punish doctors, and adding a comment from The Man himself: <U+201C>My position has not changed <U+2014> like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.<U+201D> We have here the perfect encapsulation of the current Republican presidential campaign: 1) Trump says something very strange. 2) The campaign says he didn<U+2019>t really say it. 3) Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan. Pence, cornered by Kaine, finally blurted out, <U+201C>Look, he<U+2019>s not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton.<U+201D> Well, that would be one way of putting it.

Posted on Oct 28, 2016 Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton argued over foreign policy during the third presidential debate. (Screen shot via YouTube ) \nWe are only 10 days away from Election Day, and the two mainstream candidates are steamrolling through the swing states in an effort to court votes. Over the past week, WikiLeaks provided some revelations on how Clinton and her husband used the Clinton Foundation to their advantage. Donald Trump, meanwhile, continued to close in on Clinton in the polls. \nThe week began on a somber note, when news broke that longtime peace activist and California legislator Tom Hayden died at age 76. His original Truthdig reports , which have been reposted throughout the week, reinforce the importance of an anti-war foreign policy. <U+201C>Our systems<U+2014>politics, media, culture<U+2014>are totally out of balance today because of our collective refusal to admit that the Vietnam War was wrong and that the peace movement was right,<U+201D> he said in 2016 . \nMany of his reports written back in 2006 focus on American foreign policy in the Middle East. Although written over a decade ago, Hayden<U+2019>s words of caution still ring true, as in this piece on a potential U.S. withdrawal from Iraq : \nMany activists are learning for the first time, or perhaps all over again, what it means to be winter soldiers in a long war. All the wasted lives can never be brought back, all those squandered tax dollars will never be redistributed, true enough. But if the war itself was never going to be a cakewalk, why should ending it be any different? It may still be far from over, with the simmering question of Iran on the immediate horizon. \nAs Hayden warned, U.S. involvement in the Middle East is far from over, and throughout this election season a new player has entered the arena: Russia. \nEarlier this week, Trump stated that Clinton, if elected, would cause World War III with Russia. Truthdig contributor Juan Cole argued that <U+201C>[s]uperpowers don<U+2019>t fight one another in the nuclear age<U+2026>[they] fight proxy wars like Vietnam and Afghanistan.<U+201D> Cole asserts that Clinton<U+2019>s experience as secretary of state will make it easy for her to communicate with the Russian government and the Pentagon alike. \nOthers, however, don<U+2019>t feel too positive about a potential Clinton administration<U+2019>s foreign policy. Clinton has proposed a <U+201C>no-fly<U+201D> zone over Syria as part of her foreign policy plan, alarming security experts . \nAs Lauren McCauley writes, reports also surfaced this week showing how a Clinton administration <U+201C>will likely usher in a more aggressive, bipartisan foreign policy in the Middle East and beyond.<U+201D> She quotes Greg Jaffe: \nThe Republicans and Democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the groundwork for a more assertive American foreign policy via a flurry of reports shaped by officials who are likely to play senior roles in a potential Clinton White House,<U+201D> the Washington Post<U+2019>s White House correspondent Greg Jaffe reports. \nOne such study, published Wednesday by the Center for American Progress (CAP)<U+2014>which is run by president Neera Tanden, policy director for Clinton<U+2019>s presidential campaign<U+2014>recommends the next administration step up its <U+201C>military engagement<U+201D> amid a more <U+201C>proactive and long-term approach to the Middle East.<U+201D> \nBut what of Trump<U+2019>s foreign policy? Juan Cole also argued earlier this week that when it comes to Trump<U+2019>s assertions on the U.S. presence in the Middle East, <U+201C>he doesn<U+2019>t have the slightest idea of what he is talking about.<U+201D> \nTruthdig<U+2019>s own Bill Boyarsky expressed a similar concern in his column this week, labeling Trump <U+201C>a threat to democracy.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>Trump<U+2019>s scorn for the electoral system and democratic institutions is reason enough to fear a Trump presidency,<U+201D> Boyarsky writes. <U+201C>Added to that is his racist rabble-rousing against Muslims, those of Mexican descent and other immigrants.<U+201D> \nAnd of course, the discussion on foreign policy doesn<U+2019>t solely revolve around just two presidential nominees. This week, NATO urged <U+201C>all allies to deploy more troops and military equipment to Russia<U+2019>s borders<U+201D> in a move that Common Dreams staff writer Nika Knight called <U+201C>shortsighted.<U+201D> \nThere is also an inherent problem with the American military spending, says William D. Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. <U+201C>Through good times and bad, regardless of what<U+2019>s actually happening in the world, one thing is certain: in the long run, the Pentagon budget won<U+2019>t go down,<U+201D> he writes. <U+201C>As long as fear, greed, and hubris are the dominant factors driving Pentagon spending, no matter who is in the White House, substantial and enduring budget reductions are essentially inconceivable.<U+201D> \nSo although there are broader, deeply embedded institutional factors responsible for American foreign policy, whoever wins on November 8 will certainly make an impact. Given the events of the past week<U+2014>the focus on increased tensions with Russia, and the tightening race between Clinton and Trump<U+2014>we turn to you, our readers. Which candidate has a foreign policy position worth pursuing?

Close Black-hearted Americans across the country reportedly celebrated in the streets after Donald Trump was declared the victor, becoming the first black-hearted president in the nation<U+2019>s history. NEWS November 9, 2016 Vol 52 Issue 44 <U+00B7> Politics <U+00B7> Politicians <U+00B7> Election 2016 <U+00B7> Donald Trump \nWASHINGTON<U+2014>Shattering a barrier long thought unbreakable in the United States, Donald Trump, the 70-year-old billionaire real estate mogul from New York, became the first black-hearted man in history to win the American presidency, in the early hours of Wednesday morning. \nPresident-elect Trump, who in July became the first black-hearted nominee of a major political party, once again rewrote the history books as the first black-hearted man to capture the majority of votes in the electoral college, defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a closely contested race. The once unimaginable outcome of a black-hearted man assuming the role of commander-in-chief of the United States has already sent major shockwaves through the nation and, indeed, across the world. \n<U+201C>Honestly, I<U+2019>m in shock<U+2014>I cannot believe that we just elected a black-hearted man as president of the United States,<U+201D> said Stephen Payton, 49, of Greensboro, NC, adding that just the thought of a black-hearted man sitting in the Oval Office <U+201C>sent chills down [his] spine.<U+201D> <U+201C>Frankly, I never thought I<U+2019>d live to see us put a man like that in the White House, but I guess times do change. Our nation is clearly moving in a new direction.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>It just goes to show you that anything is possible in America,<U+201D> he continued. \nTrump<U+2019>s victory, which defied the long-held conventional wisdom about the prospects of black-hearted candidates, has been described as a watershed moment for the nation<U+2019>s millions of black-hearted Americans whose overwhelming support buoyed his run for the presidency. Encouraged by the possibility of one of their own occupying the highest seat of power in the nation, black-hearted Americans reportedly turned out in record numbers in all 50 states, propelling Trump to a historic victory. \nPerhaps most critically, early analysis indicates that Trump<U+2019>s win may have been sealed by his ability to capture the votes of millions of Americans who were long assumed to be incapable of ever voting for a black-hearted candidate. \n<U+201C>Having someone who is black-hearted running the country is definitely going to change everything,<U+201D> said Samantha Davis, 56, of Tacoma, WA, who explained that she expects Trump to govern in accordance with the values and beliefs shaped by his formative years growing up as a young black-hearted man in New York City. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s no way he<U+2019>s going to be like any of the other men who came before him. He<U+2019>s proud to be a black-hearted man because that<U+2019>s exactly who he is.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>And that won<U+2019>t change just because he<U+2019>s the president,<U+201D> she added. \nWhile no official announcements have been made, Washington insiders believe that Trump is also expected to name black-hearted Americans to fill key cabinet positions, with sources identifying former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani as likely choices for top roles. \nReflecting on the historic nature of the evening and what it may mean for the future, many have described Trump<U+2019>s election as perhaps the single greatest achievement in black-hearted history. \n<U+201C>Oh my God, he actually won!<U+201D> said Kyle Leigh, 27, of Watertown, NY, before pausing and breaking down in tears after learning that a black-hearted man will now occupy the White House for the next four or eight years. <U+201C>This really happened. It<U+2019>s just starting to sink in.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>Nothing is going to be the same after this election,<U+201D> he added. <U+201C>Nothing.<U+201D> Share This Story: WATCH VIDEO FROM THE ONION Sign up For The Onion's Newsletter \nGive your spam filter something to do.

Our press is allowed to say whatever they want and get away with it,<U+201D> Trump told Miami<U+2019>s CBS affiliate in an interview published Sunday. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m a big believer, tremendous believer of the freedom of the press. Nobody believes it stronger than me, but if they make terrible, terrible mistakes and those mistakes are made on purpose to injure people.<U+201D> Story Continued Below The Republican presidential nominee has made threats of litigation a regular part of his White House campaign, most recently suggesting that he would sue the various women who have accused him of sexually assaulting them. He has denied all the allegations against him and chalked up the array of negative reporting about him to a vast conspiracy involving the media and the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump has also threatened to sue multiple media outlets over coverage he deemed unfair, although he has not yet filed any of the threatened lawsuits. In response to one such threat from the Manhattan billionaire, concerning a story published by The New York Times outlining two allegations of assault against Trump, attorneys for the Times responded by writing that <U+201C>if [Trump] believes that American citizens had no right to hear what these women had to say and that the law of this country forces us and those who would dare to criticize him to stand silent or be punished, we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight.\" In his interview with the CBS affiliate in Miami, Trump said Great Britain<U+2019>s relatively weaker protections for free speech and the press force media outlets to act more responsibly. <U+201C> Well, in England you have a good chance of winning.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Fred Reed \n source: unz.com \n text: Stamptastic / Shutterstock.com \nOh good. The world reaches a crossroads, or probably a road off a cliff, just when I want to relax and watch gratuitous violence on the tube. To judge by the rapid drift of events aboard our planetary asylum, the talons of Washington and New York on the world<U+2019>s throat are fast being pried a-loose. The Global American Imperium is dying. Or so it sure looks anyway. \nI say talons of <U+201C>New York and Washington<U+201D> because America<U+2019>s foreign policy, forged in those two cities, belongs entirely to them. Americans have no influence on it. Further, none of what the Empire does abroad is of any benefit to Americans. Do you care at all what happens in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, or the South China Sea? Do you want to pay for it? America has been hijacked. \nAnd the Empire prospereth not. It prospereth very not. Consider the recent record of the world<U+2019>s hyperpower: \nWashington does not have control of Afghanistan, and obviously is not going to. \nWashington does not have control of Iraq, and appears unlikely to. \nWashington did not back Iran down, and isn<U+2019>t going to. \nWashington did not back Russia down in Ukraine and Crimea, and isn<U+2019>t going to. \nWashington did not back China down in the South China Sea and, while this is perhaps not over, the Empire seems to be losing. \nWashington has not backed North Korea down and is not going to. \nIn the Philippines, President Duterte has told Obama to <U+201C>go to hell<U+201D> as being <U+201C>the son of a whore,<U+201D> which may be taken to indicate latent hostility. He is vigorously seeking rapprochement with China. While Washington may have him murdered, it seems to be losing control of the Little Vassals of ASEAN. \nTurkey seems to be cuddling up to Russia<U+2013>that is, looking East like Duterte. Maybe Washington can turn this around temporarily, but there<U+2019>s a whole lot of wavering going on. \nMeanwhile Washington thrashes around impotently as per usual in Syria, and, though the jury remains out on this one, looks to have poor prospects. If Washington<U+2013>AKA New York<U+2013>loses here, after doing so in Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and Afghanistan, the Empire will beyond redemption be on the downward slope. \nThe United States is not in danger. The Empire is. This is not good. Empires, the Soviet Union notwithstanding, seldom go quietly. Either Washington gambles on war of some sort against Russia, or Russia and China, in the desperate hope of reversing things, or the Empire gets slowly eaten. Or not so slowly. Once one country pries itself loose, many may rush for the door. \nNew York may go for calculated war against Russia<U+2013>say, cyberwar expected not to turn into shooting war, shooting war in Syria not expected to turn into global shooting war, global shooting war not expected to turn into nuclear war. This will be a crapshoot. Note that America has badly misguessed the outcomes of every war since Korea. \nThis is why the American election actually matters, unusual in Presidential contests. It is Blowhard against Corruption, a swell choice, but Trump is firmly against war with Russia, and Hillary for. Her military understanding is that of a fried egg. \nThe woman is both a fool and a knave but, it seems, Trump has talked trash, and therefore she will likely be President. Weirdly, the future of the world depends on how an excited electorate of political middle-schoolers responds to one candidate<U+2019>s dirty talk. From a curmudgeon<U+2019>s point of view, it is pretty funny. It is funnier if one lives outside of the radiation footprint. \nBut back to business. The seaboard Axis of Evil needs a war because almost every tide runs against it. Proximately, the Axis has pushed China, Russia, and Iran together against the Empire. (First rule of empire: Do not let the dissidents unite.) Many signs suggest that the world, or much of it, is beginning to see China as its future. The BRICS, the SCO, the NDB, the AAIB<U+2013>all exclude the US. China becomes the major trading partner of country after country. The twilight deepens. \nNot all goes wrong for the Empire<U+2013>not yet, but things are getting spooky. On the European Peninsula of Asia, countries remain docile, especially England and, much more importantly, Germany. Yet even among Washington<U+2019>s European harem, there seem to be faint stirrings of a forgotten independence. As I understand it, Germany<U+2019>s businessmen would very much like to end Washington<U+2019>s sanctions on Russia and improve trade with China, which would be greatly to the benefit of the Peninsula. Washington won<U+2019>t let them. It can<U+2019>t. If the Europeans did what would be good for themselves, and looked to Eurasia, then the fat lady, already warming up, would burst into full bellow. \nWhich, methinks, raises the likelihood that Washington will in desperation do something phenomenally stupid. At this writing Hillary<U+2019>s camp seems to be prepping the public for war with Russia. The telescreen tells us day after day that Putin is Hitler, that Russia is expanding, that the Russkies are hacking the election, that they cause indigestion and falling hair. Is this just Hillary waggling her codpiece in the expectation that Moscow will demurely back down, as God intended? Or will she again send other people<U+2019>s children to fight for her in somebody else<U+2019>s country? \nThe larger picture, assuredly obvious to New York, is truly grim<U+2013>for New York, not for Americans. China has a huge population of a billion Han Chinese, versus two hundred million Caucasian Americans<U+2013>these being the scientific, technological and entrepreneurial brains of the Empire. One must not notice this, but you can bet that New York and Beijing do. Economically China is growing hugely, advancing technologically at a high rate, building rail lines that now extend from the Chinese Pacific coast to Madrid. It will increasingly dwarf the Empire no matter what happens<U+2013>short of a world war. \nThe curtain falls in ways unnoticed. China recently launched a communications satellite, the world<U+2019>s first employing quantum cryptographic links, which cannot be intercepted. The intention of this, as well of the QC link from Beijing to Shanghai, is to keep the NSA off China<U+2019>s back. A small thing, perhaps. Yet if successful and adopted en masse by other countries weary of Washington<U+2019>s meddling, the result will be a loosening of the Empire<U+2019>s grip on everybody<U+2019>s communications. \nFor the Empire it is, as Elvis sang, <U+201C>now or never.<U+201D> Lenin spoke of <U+201C>useful idiots.<U+201D> Ours aren<U+2019>t even useful, but they call the shots. \nFred can be reached at jetpossum-readers@yahoo.com.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Jason Douglas \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-economy-to-grow-more-slowly-than-forecast-says-treasury-chief-1479907060 \n text: LONDON<U+2014>U.K. Treasury chief Philip Hammond signaled a new course after almost a decade of belt-tightening on Wednesday, saying he expects billions in extra borrowing over the next few years to support an economy predicted to slow as it exits the European Union. In an annual fall statement to Parliament, Mr. Hammond laid out the government<U+2019>s most-detailed assessment yet of the economic effects of the June vote to leave the EU and how it intends to respond. He also announced a series of small measures aimed at boosting the incomes of working families, whose frustration at lopsided economic growth officials and pollsters say is a driving force behind a populist wave in Europe and the U.S. Presenting official forecasts from the U.K.<U+2019>s independent budget watchdog, Mr. Hammond said economic growth will be slower over the next few years than predicted before the referendum and government borrowing more than <U+00A3>100 billion ($124 billion) higher than planned. Still, the predicted slowdown is much less stark than some had feared before the referendum, and comes after data showed robust growth in the three months immediately after the vote. Mr. Hammond said the economy<U+2019>s resilience had <U+201C>confounded commentators at home and abroad.<U+201D> Formally abandoning his predecessor<U+2019>s target of closing the U.K.<U+2019>s budget deficit by 2020, Mr. Hammond said the government will instead seek to close the gap <U+201C>as soon as possible<U+201D> after elections slated for 2020. The move toward higher borrowing represents a break with a yearslong focus on eliminating the budget deficit that has been central to Conservative-led government<U+2019>s policies in the U.K. since 2010. A similar shift is under way in other advanced economies, including Canada and, to a lesser extent, Germany. In the U.S., investors have sent stocks and the dollar higher in anticipation of higher fiscal spending by President-elect Donald Trump. It also highlights the challenge facing Britain as it takes the unprecedented step of exiting the 28-member European club it has been part of for more than 40 years. Mr. Hammond held back for now on a large stimulus, instead focusing his fire on investment spending to address weaknesses including poor productivity, saying his aim was getting the U.K. ready for Brexit. <U+201C>Our task is to prepare our economy to be resilient as we exit the EU, and match-fit for the transition that will follow,<U+201D> Mr. Hammond said. Growth will slow to 1.4% in 2017 from 2.1% this year, according to the U.K.<U+2019>s Office for Budget Responsibility, before gradually picking up again in 2018 and beyond. The forecast chimes with that of the Bank of England, and assumes the U.K. leaves the EU in 2019 as Prime Minister Theresa May plans. The anticipated slowdown reflects a coming squeeze on consumer spending from accelerating inflation linked to the falling pound as well as the damping effect on business investment of uncertainty over the U.K.<U+2019>s economic outlook. Those effects are expected to sap tax revenue and push up government spending, Mr. Hammond said, resulting in wider budget deficits in years to come. On current projections, the government will still be spending more than it takes in taxes by early 2022. He confirmed the government<U+2019>s intention to press ahead with plans announced in March to cut the main corporate tax rate to 17% by 2020, while tweaking some rules to prevent big firms offsetting past losses against their tax bills. Higher borrowing also reflects plans to invest more in roads, railways, internet connectivity and other growth-friendly infrastructure projects , Mr. Hammond said. In all, the government expects to borrow <U+00A3>122 billion more over the next five years than was forecast in March, of which almost <U+00A3>60 billion represented the direct hit to public finances from the Brexit vote, according to the OBR. U.K. government bonds edged lower as Mr. Hammond laid out his plans, though sterling and U.K. stocks were little moved. The yield on the 10-year government bond was last up around by 0.06 percentage point on the day at 1.448%, according to Tradeweb. Part of the rise in yields, which gain as prices fall, followed the release of strong U.S. economic data that sent global bond yields higher. <U+2014>Paul Hannon and Christopher Whittall contributed to this article.

In the year of 2000 there were seven countries without a Rothschild owned Central Bank: Afghanistan North Korea Iran It is not a coincidence that these country, which are listed above were and are still being under attack by the western media, since one of the main reasons these countries have been under attack in the first place is because they do not have a Rothschild owned Central Bank yet.The first step in having a Central Bank establish in a country is to get them to accept an outrageous loans, which puts the country in debt of the Central Bank and under the control of the Rothschilds. If the country does not accept the loan, the leader of this particular country will be assassinated and a Rothschild aligned leader will be put into the position , and if the assassination does not work, the country will be invaded and have a Central Bank established with force all under the name of terrorism. Rothschild-owned Central Bank Central banks are illegally created private banks that are owned by the Rothschild banking family . The family has been around for more than 230 years and has slithered its way into each country on this planet, threatened every world leader and their governments and cabinets with physical and economic death and destruction, and then emplaced their own people in these central banks to control and manage each country<U+2019>s pocketbook. Worse, the Rothschilds also control the machinations of each government at the macro level , not concerning themselves with the daily vicissitudes of our individual personal lives. Except when we get too far out of line. The only countries left in 2003 without a Central Bank owned by the Rothschild Family were: Sudan",

This past quarter, Elon Musk<U+2019>s Tesla company made a profit of $22 million, while the entire U.S. oil industry lost a total of $67 billion last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration . This is in part due to the global oil prices falling, as well as humanity<U+2019>s awakening push for clean, renewable energy. \nAccording to the Renewable Energy Institute , the price efficiency of solar technology will be better than fossil fuel by 2025 and will continue to get cheaper and cheaper until that time. \nHowever, the newly elected President of the U.S. says that he wants to <U+201C>lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.<U+201D> Donald Trump also says he will initiate this action within his first 100 days of being in office. \nWhile this action is certain to increase jobs for more Americans, we must also take into account the environmental impact this will have as even more carbon will be released into the atmosphere if these now dormant energy reserves begin to be tapped. \nAdditionally, the price of oil continues to remain low and even if jobs are created, there is no guarantee these companies in the fossil fuel industry will be able to profit financially. \nThe way the world is recognizing the necessity to move away from fossil fuels, as well as the increased technological capability, it appears as though Donald Trump will have a very difficult time putting this part of his plan into action. \nInstead, he is likely to face a wave of opposition if he tries to implement such measures as people know that we can<U+2019>t keep pumping even more carbon into the atmosphere if we want our world<U+2019>s atmosphere to return to pristine condition. \nEarlier this year, leaders from Russia, China, Japan and South Korea met to sign an agreement to begin working on a project called the Asian Super-Grid . The project will include wind and solar technologies and will power various parts of the world, including Europe, Southern Africa, South and Southeast Asia, as well as the four countries involved. \nWhat we are seeing right now in our world is the writing on the wall: We see what destruction and pollution can come from the fossil fuel industry (as well as the political destruction that occurs through war to gain more oil resources from the Middle East) and we see that the solutions to these issues already exist. \nWe see more and more that the solutions are being put into place, and now on an even wider scale (Asian Super-Grid). We also are seeing the economic reality of either continuing down the old path of fossil fuels as well as the bright new path being forged with clean and sustainable energy. \n2017 is going to be quite a year. We have the solutions, but will we implement them on a mass scale? \nLance Schuttler graduated from the University of Iowa with a degree in Health Science and does health coaching through his website Orgonlight Health .

These protests are in opposition to the November 8th national election where the citizens of the United States selected Donald Trump to be the 45th president.\n\n\nGrassroots movement or orchestrated globalist takeover? \nProtesters believe that the election of Trump is unfathomable and are refusing to accept the electoral college system put in place by the country's founding fathers to prevent tyrannical rule by high concentrations of the population. As they refuse to accept many of the rights given in the Constitution for their make-believe rights, it is no surprise that they would have no respect for the foreknowledge of our founders and their development of the electoral college.\n\nWhile meaning to protest what they see as tyrannical rule under President-Elect Donald Trump, many of the misinformed marchers are playing into the hand of the globalist billionaire George Soros anad his plan to single-handedly control all the world's major governments.\n\n\nWhat is seen happening across America is reminiscent of the protests around the world that Soros has orchestrated in his quest to gain control of all world economies and politics. Similar protests have been carried out in Ukraine as well as the Arab spring that put Soros' puppets in control of those countries and played directly into his plans of world domination.\n\nMost news organizations are trying to paint the American protests as being young people, LGBT supporters, minorities, and women that are concerned about their freedoms and protection under a Trump administration. These reports try to give the impression that these people have come together organically and coincidentally formed large groups to gain the media's attention. Many patriots in these cities, however, are reporting that the protesters they are seeing are not even from those towns but rather bused in to inflate numbers and incite the meager crowds that would form on their own . \n\nWATCH THE VIDEO: Orchestrating large demonstrations in multiple cities throughout the country would need major planning and massive funding. Soros' experience with leading such movements has been well documented in the past, and these protests fit perfectly into the modus operandi of the would-be leader of a one-world government.\n\nThe website MoveOn. Org is a common tool of the globalist to enlist those who are in on the farce as well as capture the minds of a well-meaning idealist who need only a small shove in the direction of anarchy and one world rule. The site has been proven to be funded by Soros, and many of the protests which disrupt traffic and businesses in major cities can be attributed to the site's involvement.\n\nNot only does Soros use the common citizens to play into his game, but he also has many of the world's leaders in his arsenal of political puppets he uses to change world markets as he chooses. Hillary Clinton was confirmed to be one of these puppets with the Wikileaks release of private email communications between her and Soros. One of these emails plainly details how Soros was behind Clinton's choosing of Miroslav Lajcak to mediate throughout his orchestrated unrest in Albania.\n\nAmericans must remain vigilant and fight against the globalists' attempted coup to take over the United States republic as it was formed by the founding fathers and their inspired foresight into our future. \nDisclose TV SOURCE",

Five co-defendants also were tried one or both of the charges. Ammon Bundy has a house in Emmett. \nDespite the acquittal, the Bundys were expected to stand trial in Nevada early next year on charges stemming from another high-profile standoff with federal agents. Authorities rounding up cattle at their father Cliven Bundy<U+2019>s ranch in 2014 because of unpaid grazing fees released the animals as they faced armed protesters. \nThe Bundy family initially made headlines in 2013 when the Bureau of Land Management brought armed agents in to seize rancher Cliven Bundy<U+2019>s cattle after his refusal to pay federal authorities a massive debt <U+2013> which he claims is illegitimate. \nIn response to the militarized response in Nevada by the BLM, militia from across the U.S. mobilized and coordinated a response which saw hundreds of armed Americans stand up to what they perceived as vast federal overreach. \nWhat the government thought would be an open-and-shut case was anything but. The group never denied they seized the refuge while armed or that they made demands of the government. \n<U+201C>Ladies and gentlemen, this case is not a whodunit,<U+201D> Assistant U.S. Attorney Ethan Knight said in his closing argument, making the argument the group illegally commandeered a federal building. \nThe AP reports: \nOn technical grounds, the defendants said they never discussed stopping individual workers from accessing their offices but merely wanted the land and the buildings. On emotional grounds, Ammon Bundy and other defendants argued that the takeover was an act of civil disobedience against an out-of-control federal government that has crippled the rural West. \nFederal prosecutors took two weeks to present their case, finishing with a display of more than 30 guns seized after the standoff. An FBI agent testified that 16,636 live rounds and nearly 1,700 spent casings were found. \nAmmon Bundy spent three days testifying in his own defense, focusing on the fact that federal overreach is destroying rural Western communities that have relied on the land <U+2014> for generations in many cases. Bundy made clear that the plan was to simply take control of the refuge by occupation, while eventually returning it to local control. \nOriginally, 26 occupiers were charged with conspiracy. Eleven pleaded guilty, while another had the charge dropped. Seven defendants have not yet been tried. Their trial is scheduled to begin February 14, according to the AP. \nShortly after the verdict was announced, an Oregon-area reporter posted to Twitter that Ammon Bundy<U+2019>s attorney Marcus Mumford was tackled by U.S. Marshals after insisting that Bundy should be allowed to be released from custody, with the judge subsequently ordering the courtroom cleared. \nThe armed occupiers took control of the remote bird sanctuary on January 2, in response to the prison sentences given to two local ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, after being convicted of arson in relation to an ongoing dispute with the BLM. Upon occupying the refuge the group demanded that the father and son be freed and that federal officials cede control of publicly held lands to local control. \nUltimately, the Bundy brothers and a number of their fellow occupiers were arrested in an ambush style attack, while on the way to negotiate with a Sheriff. It ended with officers gunning down Robert <U+201C>LaVoy<U+201D> Finicum <U+2013> a charismatic group spokesman. Currently, numerous federal SRT agents are under investigation for lying about firing at the occupiers<U+2019> vehicle during the ambush. \nThe majority of the remaining occupants left the refuge in the wake of Finicum<U+2019>s killing , with four holdouts negotiating their surrender until February 11. \nIn the wake of the verdict, both the FBI and U.S. Attorney<U+2019>s Office also expressed disappointment. \nU.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams said his office <U+201C>respects the verdict of the jury and thanks them for their dedicated service during this long and difficult trial.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>For many weeks, hundreds of law enforcement officers <U+2014> federal, state, and local <U+2014> worked around-the-clock to resolve the armed occupation at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge peacefully. We believe now <U+2014> as we did then <U+2014> that protecting and defending this nation through rigorous obedience to the U.S. Constitution is our most important responsibility. Although we are extremely disappointed in the verdict, we respect the court and the role of the jury in the American judicial system.<U+201D> <U+2013> Greg Bretzing, Special Agent in Charge, FBI Oregon \nRegardless of the sentiments of those in government and law enforcement, the jury carried out justice <U+2014> with this verdict solidifying that the killing of LaVoy Finnicum was nothing less than criminal . \nRevealing exactly why the 2nd Amendment is so important to a free people, Bundy testified that the reason occupiers chose to carry guns was because they understood that they would be immediately arrested otherwise and needed to protect themselves against possible government violence. \nThere is no mistaking the difference in law enforcement<U+2019>s response to unarmed protestors <U+2014> versus those that exercise their right to bear arms. One need look no further than the ongoing protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock <U+2013> which has been met with numerous militarized and violent crackdowns on non-violent water protectors <U+2013> to see exactly how differently armed protesters are treated.

By Ed Krayewski\n \" Reason \" - There were more protests around the country against the election of Donald Trump last night, with police in Portland declaring the protest there a riot due to deteriorating conditions. Rioters there threw objects at cops, attacked newspaper stands, and smashed windows. Earlier, police said protesters were trying to stop \"anarchist groups\" from destroying property, and tweeted that it encouraged others to leave the area, before declaring the situation a riot and issuing orders to disperse the \"unlawful assembly.\" Police say they made 26 arrests and dispersed the crowd using pepper spray, \"rubber ball distraction devices\" and rubber baton rounds.\nTrump returned to Twitter for the first time since being elected on Tuesday night after spending the day in Washington, tweeting that \"professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting,\" calling it \"very unfair!\" NBC News described the tweet as \"putting an end to a brief stretch of conciliatory behavior since Tuesday,\" although one salty tweet in a 72 hour period doesn't seem like enough data to come to that conclusion. Trump had \"returned to pre-election form,\" as NBC News put it, also pointing out Trump himself had tweeted in favor of a march on Washington after Mitt Romney's 2012 loss, and suggested if he lost riots could ensue.\nAt least two other prominent Trump supporters, Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke and former Rep. Joe Walsh, had also tweeted supportively of protests and civil disobedience before the election but called for a tough response after. They did not expect Trump to win, so the calculus changed. Things are different now that he's president-elect<U+0097>though not for Trump's tendency to make loose statements and the media's tendency to botch interpretations of those statements.\nTrump's tweet was characterized as \"unpresidential.\" I'm not sure what was expected at this point, particularly since such protests have, until now, worked in Trump's favor. The Trump campaign cancelled a rally in Chicago after massive protests there. Trump said the protests would \"energize\" his voters<U+0097>he clinched the nomination in May. By June, I noted how attacks on Trump supporters by anti-Trump protesters were an apparent effort to help get Trump elected. In late September, when protests and riots erupted in Charlotte after a fatal police shooting there, I suggested the city was working hard to get North Carolina in the Trump column.\nOn Wednesday night, when there were protests and \"vigils\" around the country, I suggested this trend to could end up helping Trump by earning him political capital and helping drive never-Trump conservatives back into the fold. Protesters say they are demonstrating because Donald Trump has created a climate of fear for minorities. Riots also have that tendency. If the mostly white rioters in Portland last night provide police in the city to ramp up enforcement, that endangers marginalized people the most. Protests last month over a police contract the outgoing mayor pushed through before leaving office failed to stop the contract, and it's not unreasonable to fear tonight's riots will increase tensions in altogether different neighborhoods.\nAnd for all the talk pre-election of \"voter intimidation,\" what else could violent protests over the result of an election be other than voter intimidation? Hillary Clinton won Portland overwhelmingly, but that still leaves a minority of Trump voters watching their fellow citizens destroy property over the way they voted. And it leaves a slew of residents who didn't vote, but will probably eventually be blamed for Trump's win as well. Blame anyone but Clinton and the Democratic Party.\nSome Anti-Trump protesters like to compare Trump to Hitler, yet it doesn't seem they understand their own comparison. Hitler used civil unrest<U+0097>specifically the Reichstag fire<U+0097>to greatly expand his powers after he had already been elected. At the Republican convention, Trump called America a \"divided crime scene\" and said \"only\" he could solve the country's problems. Anti-Trump protesters are setting the stage for him. It's hard to imagine what continued violent protests (the Portland group has organized as a Resistance) can accomplish other than creating a climate of fear Trump could exploit to make it easier to get what he wants, whatever that turns out to be.\nA write-up of a mostly white riot in Portland would perhaps be incomplete with a note about the occupation of a remote outpost in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in protest of federal prosecutors reneging on a plea deal with two ranchers who had set a fire on their property that spread onto federal land, appealing the sentences handed down in favor for longer ones. Those protesters were called \"terrorists\" by many left-wing commentators because they were armed. The hashtag #OregonUnderAttack went viral. No one has suggested Oregon, or Portland, have been under attack tonight, nor has anyone called the protesters or rioters terrorists. But as usual, one side has created a precedent when it was convenient rhetorically in the short term that can be used by the other side with as much, if not more, effect.\nIf anti-Trump protesters are concerned about the powers Trump will inherit, President Obama and the Congress have two and a half months to try to get something accomplished in terms of limiting executive power. The prospect is unlikely already. Directionless protests make the prospect less likely, and also place efforts at reducing government power after Trump is in office at a disadvantage. Although protesters may be more interesting in expressing their feelings, including by rioting, than reducing government power and constraining the office of the president.\nVandalized cars, smashed windows: Anti-Trump protest in Portland proclaimed <U+0091>riot<U+0092> (PHOTOS, VIDEO): Some 4,000 people started their protest at Pioneer Courthouse Square and moved to northeast Portland, according to The Oregonian daily.

Only The Deep State Is So Precise   Charles Hugh Smith \nThe Deep State's most prescient elements must derail Hillary's campaign to clear a path to Trump's executive team. \nBack in August, I asked Could the Deep State Be Sabotaging Hillary? I think we now have a definitive answer: \"These blast points on Hillary's campaign... too accurate for the Mainstream Media. Only the forces of the Imperial Deep State are so precise.\" \nThe Mainstream Media is presenting the FBI investigation as a \"lose-lose\" situation for embattled FBI Director Comey. If Comey remained quiet until after the election, he would be accused of colluding with the Clinton campaign and its allies in the Department of Justice (sic). \nBut in going public, he stands accused by Democrats of \"intervening in an election,\" i.e. raising doubts about Hillary's judgement and veracity days before Americans go to the polls. \nAnother narrative has Comey's hand forced by the threat of disgusted FBI agents leaking information that would show the FBI caved into political pressure from the Democratic Party and Clinton campaign to keep relevant material out of the public eye until after the election. \nI submit another much more powerful dynamic is in play: the upper ranks of the Deep State now view Hillary as an unacceptable liability. The word came down to Comey to act whether he wanted to or not, i.e. take one for the good of the nation/Deep State/Imperial Project. \nAs a refresher: the Deep State is the unelected government (also called the invisible or shadow government) that is not as monolithic as generally assumed. \nThe neo-conservative globalists who want Hillary to continue pushing their agenda are the more visible camp, but another less visible but highly motivated camp realizes Hillary and her neo-con agenda would severely damage the nation's security and its global influence. It is this camp that is arranging for Hillary to lose. \nThe consensus view seems to be that the Establishment and the Deep State see Trump as a loose cannon who might upset the neo-con apple cart by refusing to toe the neo-con line. \nThis view overlooks the reality that significant segments of the Deep State view the neo-con strategy as an irredeemable failure. To these elements of the Deep State, Hillary is a threat precisely because she embraces the failed neo-con strategy and those who cling to it. From this point of view, Hillary as president would be an unmitigated disaster for the Deep State and the nation/Imperial Project it governs. \nWhatever else emerges from the emails being leaked or officially released, one conclusion is inescapable: Hillary's judgement is hopelessly flawed. Combine her lack of judgement with her 24 years of accumulated baggage and her potential to push the neo-con agenda to the point of global disaster, and you get a potent need for the Deep State's most prescient elements to derail her campaign and clear a path to Trump's executive team. \nOnce this path is clear, the management of Trump's executive team can begin in earnest, a management process aimed at disengaging the nation and its global Empire from neo-con overreach. \nIf you think this scenario is \"impossible,\" let's see how the election plays out before deciding what's \"impossible\" and what's inevitable.",

The success of his battle plan will be tested in two weeks. Some Republicans are privately concerned that Mr. Baker, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, didn<U+2019>t raise enough money and deployed much of it too early, leaving the party outspent by Democratic groups in eight of 10 key Senate races in the election<U+2019>s final stretch. That could leave Republicans whose races have tightened at the campaign<U+2019>s end vulnerable, including Sens. Richard Burr in North Carolina and Roy Blunt in Missouri. At the same time, many credit Mr. Baker for sounding an early alarm over Donald Trump <U+2019>s rise and the risks to downballot candidates of being too closely aligned with the unorthodox nominee. He is also praised for being willing to deliver uncomfortable facts to GOP operatives and senators alike. Few dispute the difficulty of Mr. Baker<U+2019>s task: maintaining a Senate majority in a year when Republicans are defending 24 seats compared with 10 for Democrats, and on a ticket led by a nominee whose comments have often alienated women and Hispanic voters. Republicans hold 54 of 100 seats. Mr. Baker saw the challenge back in September 2015, penning a memo highlighting lessons that Republicans could learn from the New York businessman<U+2019>s campaign: to <U+201C>understand the populist points Trump makes and ride that wave<U+201D> and to be aware of the possible dangers presented by his attitude toward women. <U+201C>Houston, we have a problem,<U+201D> Mr. Baker wrote, more than a year before Mr. Trump<U+2019>s lewd comments about grabbing women in a 2005 video surfaced this month. <U+201C>Isolate Trump on this issue by offering a quick condemnation of it,<U+201D> he wrote. Incumbent Republicans said they absorbed the memo<U+2019>s recommendation that this was a year to focus on local issues. <U+201C>All of us took it to heart<U+2014>we implemented it in different ways,<U+201D> Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) said of the memo. Of its shaved-head author, Mr. Portman said that <U+201C>he<U+2019>s as intense as his haircut would indicate.<U+201D> Mr. Baker, who left for Marines boot camp within 24 hours of his high-school graduation, is known for his blunt, military-style approach. The 40-year-old starts his days sometimes before 4 a.m., emailing staff members and making to-do lists. He doesn't watch television and rarely drinks. His motto, gleaned from his military service, he said, is <U+201C>the only easy day was yesterday.<U+201D> In a town where lawmakers are still treated with assiduous deference, he is also known for being willing to give lawmakers unsparing assessments of their races. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re here to win. It<U+2019>s not my job to pat people on the back,<U+201D> Mr. Baker said in an interview. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) said when he was considering running for re-election this year, Mr. Baker didn<U+2019>t pretend he would coast to victory in the perennial swing state. <U+201C>He could<U+2019>ve come to me and said, <U+2018>This will be easy, don<U+2019>t worry about it,<U+2019><U+201D> Mr. Rubio said. <U+201C>I appreciated that candor. If he had said something different, I wouldn<U+2019>t have trusted him.<U+201D> But dozens of Republican operatives said Mr. Baker<U+2019>s sharp-edged style can backfire. Some of those who have been screamed at by him have been less willing to help wrangle donors and senators to raise money. Although a 2014 change to campaign-finance laws allows national party committees to collect more money from donors, the NRSC raised less money through the end of August than in either 2014 or 2012. At the start of September, it had raised $65.6 million, below the $77.2 million it amassed by the same point in 2014 and $72.4 million in 2012. The NRSC fired its fundraiser at the end of 2015, according to someone familiar with the committee. And because the NRSC opted to spend early, it had less cash on hand on Labor Day<U+2014>$11.9 million<U+2014>than it did at the same point in 2014, when it had $19.9 million, or in 2012 with $28.9 million. <U+201C>By spending early, we provided a road map to others, defined our opponents before early voting and gave our candidates the opportunity to run positive ads while the airways were relatively clear,<U+201D> Mr. Baker said. Critics said it is hard to know early which races will end up being the tightest. The NRSC also expected outside groups would spend more heavily closer to November, according to someone familiar with the committee. <U+201C>Our donors put their hands in their pocket and stuck out their lower lips when they didn<U+2019>t get the nominee that they wanted,<U+201D> said Brad Todd, a GOP operative and founding partner of OnMessage Inc., a Republican media agency. But campaign-finance experts said Republican donors have been contributing to other groups, including the Senate Leadership Fund super PAC. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m sure there are some Republican donors who are sitting out, but it<U+2019>s quite clear there are a lot of Republican donors who are funneling their money into the Senate instead<U+201D> of the presidential race, said Ian Vandewalker, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute that tracks political spending. The NRSC said last week it had raised $15 million in September, its best month of the election cycle. The committee ended September with $12.3 million on hand, and would have been out of cash had it not also taken out a $15 million loan. Senate Democrats<U+2019> campaign arm raised $19 million in September, leaving it with $28.5 million in cash on hand and no debt. On the recruiting front, Republicans widely view GOP Rep. Joe Heck as a standout candidate in Nevada, but many are dismayed they aren<U+2019>t fielding a competitive challenger in Colorado, where a Democratic incumbent was beaten in 2014. <U+201C>It may very well have been a missed opportunity,<U+201D> former Colorado GOP chairman Ryan Call said of the state<U+2019>s Senate race this year, but he said he recognized the NRSC had to prioritize its spending. Some of Mr. Baker<U+2019>s expenses at the NRSC have also raised eyebrows. He spent almost $5,000 in three stays at the Loews Regency Hotel in New York City, a luxury hotel near Central Park, according to campaign finance reports. The NRSC said those expenses included other staff members<U+2019> lodging and that he hosted several fundraising meals. And coming back from the GOP convention in Cleveland, the NRSC chartered a private plane to fly home staff members, according to multiple Republican operatives. The NRSC paid Moby Dick Airways $4,962 the week after the convention, according to a campaign finance report. The NRSC said it does charter planes, but wouldn't confirm using one to return from the convention. Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com",

Suppose that during one of the October 2000 presidential debates, Vice President Al Gore had been asked the following question: <U+201C>Do you make the .<U+00A0>.<U+00A0>. commitment that you<U+2019>ll absolutely accept the result of the election?<U+201D> Moderator Chris Wallace put that query to Donald Trump last night . Now for the experimental part: Imagine Gore giving a completely truthful answer<U+2014>that is, an answer that not only reflected his honest intent but accurately anticipated how he would respond to various scenarios, including the one that actually obtained. It seems to us that Gore<U+2019>s hypothetical answer would be similar to Trump<U+2019>s actual one<U+2014>not the long back-and-forth in which Trump enumerated complaints including media bias, FBI corruption and poorly maintained voter rolls, but the prospective bottom line, to wit: <U+201C>I will look at it at the time. I<U+2019>m not looking at anything now, I<U+2019>ll look at it at the time. .<U+00A0>.<U+00A0>. What I<U+2019>m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I<U+2019>ll keep you in suspense, OK?<U+201D> Gore probably wouldn<U+2019>t have said <U+201C>I<U+2019>ll keep you in suspense, OK?<U+201D><U+2014>that<U+2019>s a distinctly Trumpian bit of showmanship<U+2014>but if he were being completely truthful, he would say, as Trump did, that he would keep his options open and respond to circumstances as they arose. And did they ever arise. True, Gore delivered a gracious concession speech, but not until Dec.<U+00A0>13, more than a month after Election Day. Follow James on Twitter It isn<U+2019>t hard to imagine a counterfactual scenario in which Gore would have conceded on the normal schedule. If George W. Bush<U+2019>s initial margin in Florida had been, say, 60,000 votes (just over 1% of the total) instead of around 2,000, there would have been nothing to contest. But the narrow margin in a decisive state led to weeks of lawsuits and selective recounts<U+2014>and, even after Gore<U+2019>s concession, to years of bitter claims that he wuz robbed. Among those bitterly clinging to the myth of the stolen election<U+2014>or at least propagating it for political purposes<U+2014>was Hillary Clinton. In November 2002, Howard Fineman , then of Newsweek, reported on a speech then-Sen. Clinton gave at a private fundraiser in Los Angeles for then-Sen. Jean Carnahan of Missouri: HotAir<U+2019>s Larry O<U+2019>Connor notes that just last week Mrs. Clinton shared a stage with Gore at a Miami rally. <U+201C>Take it from me, it was a very close election,<U+201D> Gore said, referring to the one 16 years ago. In response, the crowd chanted <U+201C>YOU WON! YOU WON! YOU WON!<U+201D> Gore went on: <U+201C>Here<U+2019>s my point. I don<U+2019>t want you to be in a position years from now where you welcome Hillary Clinton and say <U+2018>Actually you did win, it just wasn<U+2019>t close enough to make sure that the votes were counted<U+2019> and whatever. Elections have consequences.<U+201D> O<U+2019>Connor: <U+201C>Through this entire sequence, Mrs. Clinton continued to smile and nod in agreement.<U+201D> When Trump said last night that he<U+2019>d keep his options open, Mrs. Clinton called it <U+201C>horrifying<U+201D> and said: It reminds us of Otter<U+2019>s famous oration in <U+201C> Animal House <U+201D>: And the merits of the argument aside, it<U+2019>s hard to see how all this does anything other than hurt Trump, for two reasons. First, it is a loud and glaring distraction from his substantive arguments, which, by the way, he made more effectively in the third debate than in either of the other two. Second, nobody likes a sore loser. Trump<U+2019>s pre-emptive soreness probably is off-putting to those who are undecided or ambivalent. Polls during the 2000 election dispute showed more voters siding with Bush than with Gore, notwithstanding that Gore<U+2019>s gross vote total had been slightly greater than Bush<U+2019>s. Republicans, as usual, are divided, many as critical of Trump as the Democrats are, as the New York Post reports: Bramnick has a point, but if one party tends to adhere to democratic norms only when it<U+2019>s convenient, the party that consistently holds itself to them is at a disadvantage. The appeal of Trump to many GOP primary voters was that <U+201C>he fights<U+201D><U+2014>meaning, among other things, that he doesn<U+2019>t engage in self-defeating moralism. But as La Rochefoucauld observed, hypocrisy is the tribute vice pays to virtue. When Trump goes low, voters may conclude Mrs. Clinton is more virtuous even though she is only pretending to go high.

One of the most large-scale protests was a mass rally of thousands of students in September-October 2014, which was coined the Umbrella Movement by the Western media. It<U+2019>s almost a year later and new riots, albeit significantly less serious ones, have taken place. As in 2014-2015, the nature of this stage of political turbulence in Hong Kong is the same. In general, it can be described with the slogan <U+201C>the price you have to pay for the transition period<U+201D>. This concerns the difficulties of actual implementing the beautiful concept <U+201C>One Country <U+2013> Two Systems<U+201D> created by Beijing when preparing to regain control over Hong Kong from Great Britain in 1997. Later, this concept was tested out for the possible (hypothetical and elusive) return of the lost province of Taiwan to the bosom of the Motherland. The procedure of transferring Hong Kong to the People<U+2019>s Republic of China was provided for by the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984 during a visit of the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to China. The strained relations between Beijing and Hong Kong are entirely based on events that preceded the handover. It<U+2019>s important to remember that in the mid-19th century, Hong Kong was under the control of Great Britain following the so-called Opium Wars (which can be considered a <U+201C>crime against humanity<U+201D> by today<U+2019>s standards). The following 150 years, Hong Kong formed a community of citizens that were very different from the citizens in modern-day China both in terms of mentality and living standards. Today, the latter is perhaps the major factor, which determines the mood of Hong Kong<U+2019>s population. However, the Western media describe the wariness of Hong Kong citizens in respect of the gradual integration into China as a mantra on <U+201C>the strive for democracy and freedom<U+201D>. However, the same <U+201C>fraudsters<U+201D> that appeared during the decline of the USSR, then in the Middle East, and now in Ukraine, are manipulating the situation with fake ideas of <U+201C>democracy<U+201D> and <U+201C>freedom<U+201D>. There was no democracy in British Hong Kong. It only started to appear after the accession to the People<U+2019>s Republic of China. According to many Hong Kong citizens, this is not enough as it currently does not allow it to maintain distance from China. But this is another issue that is indirectly linked to the phenomenon of democracy as a specific social and political structure of the society. In terms of Hong Kong, it functions in compliance with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong developed in China in 1990, which came into effect in 1997, i.e. the moment Hong Kong was transferred to the Beijing<U+2019>s control. Article 104 of this document requires all the representatives of the authorities pledge allegiance to the Basic Law and to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region when assuming office. The same allegiance must be pledged by the Chief Executive, whose powers can be compared to those of the head of the fiercely Presidential Republic. Article 104 is aimed at ensuring China<U+2019>s control over the entire system of political and administrative management of Hong Kong, including its key structure. Nonetheless, the authors of the Basic Law neglected one very important element. They did not foresee the answer to the question of what would happen to those who distort the letter and intent of Article 104 when assuming office. This question arose on October 12, 2016, when several newly elected deputies of the local Legislative Council (Parliament) took the liberty of not only distorting the content of this Article but also shouting out words and provocative slogans about Beijing during their swearing-in ceremony. Moreover, they unfurled the banner <U+201C>Hong Kong is not China<U+201D>. A few days later, during a repeat of the swearing-in ceremony, <U+201C>pro-independence<U+201D> deputies left the session hall depriving the Legislative Council of the necessary quorum. On this, the Global Times published an editorial entitled <U+201C>Defiant Hong Kong legislators must be barred <U+201C>. It seems that on November 7, this question was answered. This concerns the <U+201C>interpretation<U+201D> of Article 104 that was employed that day at the regular session of the Standing Committee of the National People<U+2019>s Congress (China<U+2019>s Parliament), which assumes the status of the very same law as the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region itself. In other words, from now on, violators of Article 104 are subject to the full extent of the law. The reaction on the <U+201C>streets<U+201D> of Hong Kong to Beijing<U+2019>s message proved to be immediate and upon the signing of the Article, events similar to the Umbrella Movement of Autumn 2014 broke out. It is worthwhile pointing out some important issues: <U+2013> the outlined process of (this certain) <U+201C>crackdown<U+201D> on Hong Kong fits into the overall trend of the strengthening role of the Communist Party of China and its leader Xi Jinping in China<U+2019>s life, which was the main outcome of the 6th Plenum of the 18th Congress of China<U+2019>s leading party; <U+2013> the strong statements made by the USA and the EU on the violation of human rights in Hong Kong will hardly affect the degree of the aforementioned crackdown. For example, after producing its latest report on the situation in Hong Kong, Great Britain was strongly advised to refrain from interfering ; <U+2013> the anticipated <U+201C>moderate nature<U+201D> of the policy of tightening control over the social and political life in Hong Kong will be determined by the need to maintain at least something of Taiwan<U+2019>s positive appraisal of the <U+201C>One Country <U+2013> Two Systems<U+201D> concept. The fact that the resolution of the Taiwanese problem remains a priority task for China<U+2019>s leadership is confirmed by the deliberate attention on Hung Hsiu-chu who visited Beijing in late October 2016 . She took the charge of Kuomintang after the crushing defeats in the last two general elections in Taiwan ; <U+2013> it is likely that the current Chief Executive, Leung Chun-ying, will resign as a result of the above-mentioned events as well as others that have taken place in Hong Kong. He has always been pro-Beijing, and according to experts, he is close to a group inside the Communist Party leadership, which is competing with Xi Jinping. Hong Kong can currently be compared with a chicken that Beijing would have wrung the neck of a long time ago (despite any agreements with London) unless it continued laying financial <U+201C>golden eggs<U+201D>. In addition, ill-considered harsh measures in respect of Hong Kong may prevent the resolution of China<U+2019>s key Taiwanese problem. Therefore, Beijing has to exercise patience and carefully plan its steps in respect of the former British colony.

GOODMAN \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/business/economy/trump-rides-a-wave-of-fury-that-may-damage-global-prosperity.html?_r=0 \n text: A populist insurrection is gaining force in much of the world, drawing middle-class and blue-collar recruits who lament that they have been left behind by globalization. This upheaval threatens to upend the economic order that has prevailed since the end of World War II. This was evident before Donald J. Trump <U+2019>s triumphant rogue campaign for the American presidency. Now it is beyond argument. National leaders in Europe and North America are scrambling to placate energized, often unruly groups of people demanding change and a more generous share of the economic spoils. But the options for addressing the deficiencies of capitalism are severely constrained <U+2014> both by traditional political realities and by the broader truths of the global economy. In Britain, which shocked the world in June with its so-called Brexit vote to abandon the European Union , and now in the United States, with its stunning elevation of Mr. Trump, electorates have essentially handed governments a mandate to limit free trade. Voters have unleashed this action plan in the name of lifting the fortunes of working people. But trade is such an elemental part of the modern global economy that impeding it is almost certain to produce the opposite effect. It will damage economic growth, diminishing prosperity for all. Mr. Trump has promised to slap tariffs on Chinese imports and to punish American companies that manufacture their wares in Mexico. Britain<U+2019>s new Conservative government has signaled that it may depart Europe<U+2019>s vast single market as it negotiates divorce terms. All of this may make for satisfying politics among populists railing against the predations of elites. After the American election, like-minded politicians, including Marine Le Pen of France, Nigel Farage of Britain and Vik tor Orban of Hungary, welcomed the victory of Mr. Trump. But speeches do not translate into viable job creation strategies. The American economy depends on access to a global supply chain that produces parts used by innumerable industries, along with a great range of consumer goods. Mexico and China are central actors. Disruption threatens to increase costs for American households. Tariffs on China might provoke a trade war that could slow economic growth, while most likely just shifting factory work to other low-wage nations like Vietnam and India. Britain sells half of its exports to the nations of the European Union. If the country leaves the single market, tariffs could apply to its goods, diminishing sales and costing jobs. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election and Brexit together underscore a central facet of these times. The old ideological divisions of left and right have effectively been eclipsed by a new economic taxonomy <U+2014> those who have benefited from globalization and those who have not. In Britain, affluent communities of professionals who hire Romanians to clean their homes and who enjoy getaways to Spain overwhelmingly voted to stay in the European Union. Industrial communities that have lost jobs as manufacturing has shifted east <U+2014> to Eastern Europe, Turkey and Asia <U+2014> generally voted to leave. In the United States, college-educated urbanites making a comfortable living in the quintessential trades of globalization <U+2014> finance, technology and media <U+2014> disdained Mr. Trump. People in the center of the country who lack degrees and have seen jobs transferred to China and Mexico played a leading role in delivering the White House to Mr. Trump. In northeastern England (something like the Rust Belt of Britain) people who voted to leave Europe speak openly about doing so to punish those who beseeched them to vote to stay <U+2014> people like the exceedingly unpopular former prime minister David Cameron. The situation is so depressed, it cannot get worse, the logic runs. Any economic pain will fall on wealthy Londoners, people say. But that is almost certainly nonsense. A rupture of trade with Europe is likely to hit these industrial communities hardest. And if that happens, the people living there will be angrier than ever. Mr. Trump drew support from factory town laborers who have traditionally voted for Democrats but did not trust Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. Many recall how her husband forged the North American Free Trade Agreement, which helped cause a shift of American manufacturing to Mexico. If Mr. Trump does not find a way to satisfy their high expectations, these people are likely to feel deceived. And any proposals need to navigate the reliably treacherous politics of Washington. The latest piece of Trump real estate, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, sits just down the street from a Capitol full of people who got themselves elected in part by railing against deficits and promising to cut federal spending. The soon-to-be President Trump has vowed to counteract the problems afflicting workers by unleashing a wave of infrastructure spending that will generate jobs for skilled hands. Perhaps he will have more luck than his predecessor, President Obama, whose own plans for infrastructure spending died time and again at the hands of Republican deficit hawks. Mr. Trump is <U+2014> at least on paper <U+2014> a fellow Republican. But whatever happens from here, one may assume that populist ferment is unlikely to exhaust its vast reservoir of grievances anytime soon. Eight years after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , the people who caused it <U+2014> reckless investment bankers <U+2014> have bounced back almost as if it never happened, while many American homeowners and wage earners have yet to recover their lost wealth. Europe remains mired in stagnation. Some economies <U+2014> Italy, Greece and Finland among them <U+2014> have gone a decade without any collective economic progress. In Spain, nearly 44 percent of young people are unemployed . Many of Europe<U+2019>s problems represent a failure to reshape its policies to spur growth. Germany is the most powerful actor in Europe, and Germany maintains an obsession with budget austerity as the response to all economic problems. Since Britain<U+2019>s vote to leave Europe, some regional leaders have argued that Brexit amounts to a warning for the European Union: Absent a new economic philosophy, the situation will continue to generate hostility among a populace that cannot pay its bills. <U+201C>If you want to close this divide and you want to persuade your citizens that there is opportunity in the internationalization of the economy and innovation, you need to invest a lot,<U+201D> said the Italian minister of economic development, Carlo Calenda, during a recent interview in Rome. <U+201C>Otherwise populism will prevail, and this is a risk that we are seeing all around the world, also in the United States. And this will be a disaster for the economy, and for the geopolitical situation.<U+201D> He said this before Mr. Trump was elected. But Germany remains implacably opposed to spending more aggressively, continuing to put stock <U+2014> against all empirical evidence <U+2014> into the idea that cutting spending and eliminating worker protections are the keys to prosperity. Only Britain has taken the challenge as an opportunity to alter its fiscal policies. The new chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, has promised to scrap the deficit reduction targets of his predecessor, George Osborne. Democracy is fundamentally a means by which citizens get to tell their leaders what they want. What many now want is to banish their leaders. Either the new leaders will find a way to make global capitalism a more enriching proposition for larger numbers of people, or they, too, risk being swept aside as anger builds.

Doctors are not unified at all on their positions regarding <U+201C>the science<U+201D> of vaccines, nor are they unified in the position of removing informed consent to a medical procedure like vaccines. \nThe two most extreme positions are those doctors who are 100% against vaccines and do not administer them at all, and those doctors that believe that ALL vaccines are safe and effective for ALL people, ALL the time, by force if necessary. \nVery few doctors fall into either of these two extremist positions, and yet it is the extreme pro-vaccine position that is presented by the U.S. Government and mainstream media as being the dominant position of the medical field. \nIn between these two extreme views, however, is where the vast majority of doctors practicing today would probably categorize their position. Many doctors who consider themselves <U+201C>pro-vaccine,<U+201D> for example, do not believe that every single vaccine is appropriate for every single individual. \nMany doctors recommend a <U+201C>delayed<U+201D> vaccine schedule for some patients, and not always the recommended one-size-fits-all CDC childhood schedule. Other doctors choose to recommend vaccines based on the actual science and merit of each vaccine, recommending some, while determining that others are not worth the risk for children, such as the suspect seasonal flu shot. \nThese doctors who do not hold extreme positions would be opposed to government-mandated vaccinations and the removal of all parental exemptions. \nIn this eBook, I am going to summarize the many doctors today who do not take the most extremist pro-vaccine position, which is probably not held by very many doctors at all, in spite of what the pharmaceutical industry, the federal government, and the mainstream media would like the public to believe.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Andy Pasztor \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-space-exploration-programs-face-potential-reset-under-donald-trump-1478707242 \n text: U.S. space exploration programs<U+2014>and particularly the nation<U+2019>s budding commercial-space industry<U+2014>face a potentially major reset, as President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s team already is studying ways to revamp spending on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration while more closely coordinating military and civilian development of new big rockets. The next administration is likely to face industry pressure and strong bipartisan support on Capitol Hill to stay the course on current NASA programs, something that didn<U+2019>t happen during previous White House shifts. But with many current policies championed by some of Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s advisers, transition aides foresee policy revisions and budget challenges requiring new priorities and spending patterns. Mike Pence, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s running mate, already has promised to revive a White House space policy council, disbanded since the 1990s, to rationalize governmentwide space spending, identify new goals and squeeze savings out of longstanding initiatives. For NASA and its leading contractors, shaken by sharp changes in the wake of the 2008 presidential election, Tuesday<U+2019>s results could translate into serious belt tightening. Yet Mr. Trump has stressed the importance of supporting deep-space exploration, and his campaign attracted a cadre of veteran experts with long histories supporting robust space efforts. One far-reaching set of potential changes that have been discussed for years may now be squarely on the table, according to industry officials and transitions aides: restructuring and shrinking NASA<U+2019>s web of regional centers. Such moves could slash thousands of employees and save billions of dollars yearly. Based on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign positions, NASA<U+2019>s climate-change research also may come under the ax, along with aerospace research not directly tied to space endeavors. During the primaries, Mr. Trump hinted his NASA policies would cut agency spending as part of a broader deficit reduction drive, though such topics generated scant attention. But as the general election campaign heated up in Florida, where space is a fundamental pillar of the economy, the message morphed into extolling the importance of pursuing such programs At the same time, some of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s supporters have emphasized the need to reassess U.S. involvement in international space missions. China and Russia aim to create their own orbiting laboratories after the anticipated demise of the international space station by 2024. Meanwhile, many European countries look to scale back manned space expectations and expenditures even as they increasingly focus on Earth-observation satellites and climate research. In the spring, before Mr. Trump emerged as the GOP candidate, a coalition of academic groups and trade associations issued an unusual call for continuity in U.S. space priorities. Many former NASA leaders have consistently sent same message. Though Mr. Trump<U+2019>s national campaign leaders seemingly paid scant attention to space and his team of advisers on the topic didn<U+2019>t kick into gear until the past few weeks, people familiar with the process say a raft of policy papers and options are in the works. In an apparent pre-emptive move to head off possible personnel cuts, NASA chief Charles Bolden sent an agencywide memo praising the quality of NASA<U+2019>s workforce. He noted that support for space programs <U+201C>not only reaches across the aisle, but across public, private, academic and nonprofit sectors.<U+201D> Mr. Bolden reiterated that NASA is carrying out the Obama administration<U+2019>s drive to send astronauts to Mars in roughly three decades, adding that it is closer to that goal today <U+201C>than anyone, anywhere, at any time has ever been.<U+201D> Manned missions to the Red Planet, however, still lack technical and budget details. And entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk are eyeing the same goal and pledging to reach it faster and at lower cost. Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Eddy Lavine \n source: worldtruth.tv \n text: posted by Eddie To some extent, we all read faces all of the time. When we look at someone who is new to us, we unconsciously assess them and form opinions about them, but in addition to this instinctive form of face reading, there are far more detailed methods<U+2014>for example, like Chinese face reading, which we<U+2019>ll be exploring in this article<U+2014>with rules and regulations that have been carefully worked out over a long period of time. The best exponents of this skill are undoubtedly the Chinese, because they specialize in this form of divination. In common with all other serious forms of divination, this is a deep and difficult subject to master, but I<U+2019>ll just dip into the subject in order to introduce you to a fascinating skill. Way back in the past, school curriculums often included physiognomy, along with palmistry, until the time of Henry VIII, when puritanical religions came in and outlawed these ancient science and interests. Three Major Areas of the Face In the Chinese face reading tradition, they call the forehead area down to the eyebrows Heaven, and this is associated with the early years of one<U+2019>s life. The middle section of the face, from the eyebrows down to the base of the nose is called Human, and this is associated with the middle years of life. The lower section, from the base of the nose down to the bottom of the face is termed Earth, and this is concerned with old age. Any part of the face that is scarred, malformed, dented or discolored suggests a problem with the aspect of the subject<U+2019>s life associated with that segment of his face. Grey or black marks, whether they are a permanent feature or just a temporary situation, denote problems that are themselves either temporary or permanent depending upon the type of dark mark. Even if the discoloration is caused by a trick of the light, it will mean something to a Chinese face reading specialist. As in every other form of divination, intuition also plays a part. In the ancient science of chinese face reading, the face is divided into three main areas. Heaven Positive: If this area is clean, clear and well defined, the person will have a good start in life with good parents and a useful education. Negative: Scarring, dents or discoloration here indicate a troubled childhood and a poor education, according to Chinese face reading philosophy. The problems will be worse for a man if the disfigurement is on the left, while for a woman if the disfigurement is on the right. A wide forehead is generally considered beneficial, but in a woman, a very wide forehead suggests poor personal relationships. The lines on the forehead offer a good deal of information, some being lucky and others unfortunate. Human Positive: The middle section of the subject<U+2019>s life will be happy and productive, with stability in relationships and success in the career . Negative: This brings unhappiness, a lack of success at work and poor relationships. A human section longer than either of the other two sections suggests a determined and self-disciplined personality, according to Chinese face reading masters. Earth Positive: This indicates a happy old age with good relationships with children and grandchildren, along with prosperity and comfort. Negative: This denotes an unhappy and poor old age. The Thirteen Divisions of the Face Chinese face readers further divide the face into 13 sub-sections. Here is a very simplified form of the 13 -section reading, starting from the top of the face and working downward. The 13 divisions of chinese face reading. 1. Tien Chung If this is clean and clear, the subject will have a happy childhood and youth, a good relationship with the parents; the subject<U+2019>s parents will live to a ripe old age. If it<U+2019>s marked or misshapen, there will be unhappiness during youth, and poverty or discord in the childhood home. Veins, dark marks and so forth here suggest accidents and sudden losses of money or prestige. A widow<U+2019>s peak suggests that the father may die before the mother does. 2. Tien Ting This also refers to the parents and background, but it relates more to the mother than the father. Negatively, a marked area suggests that people won<U+2019>t believe the individual when he is telling the truth. 3. Ssu K<U+2019>ung A good complexion here suggests a fortunate and successful life , whereas discolorations tell of a bad patch in the subject<U+2019>s career, according to Chinese face reading philosophy. 4. Chung Cheng If dented, the intellect will be low. If scarred, bumpy or sporting a mole, the subject will be impatient and largely unable to bring his plans to fruition, due either to bad public relations skills or to bad luck. He will also find it hard to make and keep friends. 5. Yin T<U+2019>ang Chinese face reading masters suggest that if this area is healthy, the subject will receive an inheritance and he will succeed in business. Eyebrows that meet or almost meet denote failure, bad luck and a lack of respect from other people. Marks, scars and black moles can indicate anything from adoption to illness and failure, or even a term of imprisonment. Wrinkles or creases between the eyebrows are all right if the subject is over forty years of age, otherwise they denote difficulties, tension and even a jealous nature. 6. Shan Gen Grayness here denotes illness, whereas a green patch at the side indicates adultery. A mole suggests stomach problems, emigration or imprisonment! 7. Men Shang Moles here suggest stomach trouble, relationship problems or possibly an ill partner. Darkness here denotes a sick child. 8. Shou Shang A high bony nose suggests failure in business. Moles and discolorations signify a sick husband and difficulties with females. 9. Chun T<U+2019>ou The tip of the nose should be full in shape and clear of marks, hairs and blackheads for good fortune. 10. Jen Chung This is the grooved area between the base of the nose and the mouth, which is called the filtrum, or the falin line. If the base of the groove is wider than the upper and the indentation neither too deep nor too fl at, the subject will have healthy children and will achieve a high level of wealth and status in life. If it<U+2019>s wider at the top and shallow, the subject will have trouble in having children. His nature will be sour and he will have bad manners. Relationships will be difficult. If this area is bent, the subject will be childless, deceitful and unpopular. A straight line marked down the middle of the groove denotes children late in life according to the science of Chinese face reading. 11. Shui Hsing The mouth should be reasonably full, with a pinkish color and upturned corners to ensure prosperity, good health and a happy marriage. 12. Ch<U+2019>eng Chiang If this area is dark in the morning, the subject should avoid traveling over water during the course of that day. A man who has a hairless gap beneath his lower lip or a person of either sex who has a discoloration or scar in this area must be careful of their diet, because the stomach may be weak. 13. Ti ko The chin should be rounded, slightly protuberant and strong in appearance. A sharp chin is unlucky and a chin that points to the side belongs to someone who holds grudges. Any scarring or discoloration denotes money losses and possibly the loss of an inheritance. This can also predict family sickness and accidents.

The former couple voted for \"None Of The Above for President,\" spokesman Freddy Ford said, adding they they voted \"Republican downballot.\" Story Continued Below The Wall Street Journal initially reported that the Bushes had not voted for either major party nominee, an almost unheard-of snub in modern presidential politics. The Journal report came after Rush Limbaugh had said on his radio show Tuesday morning that the former president had in fact voted for Clinton. The family, which watched as Trump lambasted Jeb Bush throughout the primary, has avoided the GOP nominee since then. In September, POLITICO reported that former President George H.W. Bush was supporting Clinton after a friend of the family posted a photo on Facebook with the former president, captioned: \"The President told me he<U+2019>s voting for Hillary!!<U+201D> That friend, Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy, later told POLITICO that the 41st president had indicated he would be voting for a Democrat. If George W. Bush also didn<U+2019>t vote for Trump, that means no living former president will have voted for the GOP candidate. By Michael Grunwald By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Mike Merryman-Lotze \n source: antiwar.com \n text: Share This \nThis fall, the U.S. agreed to provide $38 billion in military aid to Israel over the next ten years, ensuring America<U+2019>s continued role in funding the occupation of Palestine. Meanwhile, my friends and colleagues here in Gaza live in fear of another significant Israeli attack in the near future. \nThey have every reason to fear another major escalation <U+2013> violence is a daily reality in Gaza. In two recent incidents, a rocket was fired from Gaza into Israel without causing damage or injuries, and in both instances Israel responded by bombing targets throughout Gaza. \nIn August alone, Israel bombed more than 50 locations in the small territory . \nThe simple story told about these events focuses on action and reaction: Palestinians attacked Israel with a rocket and Israel responded. We hear this logic after nearly every event of this sort, but it<U+2019>s woefully incomplete. \nIn both instances, the rockets fired weren<U+2019>t fired by Hamas, but rather by small radical armed groups at odds with Hamas, which governs Gaza. These groups seek to incite Israeli attacks on Hamas with the goal of destabilizing its control over Gaza, because they see Hamas as too comfortable with the status quo. \nSince seizing power in 2007, Hamas has worked to control and limit violence from the territory. Outside of periods of defined military escalation <U+2013> which tend to be precipitated by Israeli attacks <U+2013> they have effectively stopped attacks against Israel from Gaza. \nThis explains why, as noted by the Israeli press, there were only 14 rockets fired from Gaza towards Israel between January and August this year. None were fired by Hamas, so Israel<U+2019>s decision to target Hamas as a response makes no sense. \nOf course, 14 rockets fired from Gaza is 14 too many for those of us committed to ending all violence, and none of this should be taken as an apology for other violence perpetrated by Hamas. \nBut, as the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories reports , there were also 45 Israeli military incursions into Gaza this year, resulting in 7 Palestinian deaths and, on average, injuring five Palestinians in Gaza every week. \nThis is the part of the story that isn<U+2019>t told. \nGaza also remains under an Israeli-imposed blockade that severely limits travel, trade, and life for Gazans. Despite assurances that restrictions would be lifted in the 2014 Hamas-Israel ceasefire agreement, the blockade remains in effect. \nIsrael, with support from the US government, claims this decades-long blockade is in place to pressure the people of Gaza to rise up against Hamas and provide security for Israelis. \nIf those are Israel<U+2019>s raisons d<U+2019>etre, then it<U+2019>s a complete failure. It hasn<U+2019>t stopped violence, it hasn<U+2019>t weakened Hamas, and it hasn<U+2019>t brought Israelis or Palestinians security. \nWhile the blockade hasn<U+2019>t succeeded in achieving the changes Israel claims to be seeking, its impact on the civilian population of Gaza has been immense. \nOver two years after the end of the last large military operation there, much of Gaza remains in ruins. \nOf the 100,000 Palestinians in Gaza who were displaced during the 2014 Israeli bombardment, over 65,000 remain homeless, as 70 percent of the homes seriously damaged or destroyed haven<U+2019>t been rebuilt. This is largely because reconstruction materials remain blocked from entering Gaza. \nThis important context is too often missing as US pundits and politicians consider the situation in Gaza. \nGiven the blockade and regular military incursions imposed by Israel, the firing of less than 2 rockets per month by Palestinians cannot be seen as the core reason for violence. \nIf the US is serious about promoting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, preventing future violence in Gaza, and guaranteeing security, then it must recognize the violence inherent in the Israeli occupation and end the blockade. \nThe next attack on Gaza, feared by my friends who live there, is an inevitable reality if nothing changes. \nMike Merryman-Lotze has worked with the American Friends Service Committee as the Palestine-Israel Program Director since 2010.

She said the company was excited about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s calls for improving the country<U+2019>s transportation network. Caterpillar was up more than 7% at $90.70 at the market open and stocks for major U.S. manufacturers were broadly up across the board in recent trading as investors weigh the prospect of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s presidency following Tuesday<U+2019>selection. Trading in other companies in the sector were mixed on uncertainty regarding Trump<U+2019>s pledge to renegotiate trade deals and campaign promises to discourage companies from moving plants overseas. Auto makers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors and automotive component makers were down in recent trading, while General Electric and United Technologies were higher. Ms. Karol said Peoria, Ill.-based Caterpillar, which has a sprawling network of overseas facilities in countries including China and Mexico, would continue to push for adoption of the Trans-Pacific Partnership during the remaining days of the Obama administration. While Mr. Trump was critical of that trade deal and others, Ms. Karol said the company would continue advocating for lowering trade barriers to expand its sales overseas. <U+201C>Worried, not worried<U+2014>I think we see opportunity to advocate on the benefits of trade with this new administration and Congress,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re going to be very vocal about that.<U+201D> Martin Richenhagen, chairman and chief executive of farm equipment manufacturer Agco Corp. , said he is concerned about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s repeated support for trade protectionism during the campaign. Georgia-based Agco generates the majority of its sales in Europe and South America. The company imports farm tractors and components into the U.S. <U+201C>That would be a nightmare if we make life difficult for imports and exports,<U+201D> said Mr. Richenhagen, who is in Germany this week. <U+201C>We need to explain that to him. The Europeans are very concerned.<U+201D> Some smaller company leaders said they supported Trump because of the then-candidate<U+2019>s calls to throw out trade deals that he said decimated the sector<U+2019>s employment and his support for U.S. manufacturing. <U+201C>People really felt like this is a guy that gives them a voice,<U+201D> said Dan Larson, owner of Hydrosolutions of Duluth Inc., a Minnesota company with 15 employees fabricating metal for the aviation industry. Many companies are likely to welcome Trump<U+2019>s promises to lower taxes and reduce business regulations as well as a continuation of business friendly Republican majorities in Congress. Agco<U+2019>s Richenhagen predicted that Republican majorities in the U.S. House and Senate will be receptive to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s domestic strategy to revive business investment and economic growth with lower taxes and less regulation. <U+201C>Tax reform is easily done now,<U+201D> he said. Ron DeFeo, chief executive of Pennsylvania-based Kennametal Inc., which makes drilling tools for oil wells and metal-cutting machines, predicted that U.S. businesses will warm up to Mr. Trump if he is able to generate stronger U.S. economic growth in the coming years. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think you can begin to address the global problems when your domestic economy is stuck in neutral,<U+201D> he said. He predicted that Mr. Trump will show a more measured approach to trade policy as president than he showed during the campaign as a candidate. <U+201C>A little stiffer hand goes a long way to true up the [trade] deals that exist, but overreach will scare people,<U+201D> he said. Marvin Cunningham, president of the Long-Stanton Manufacturing Co. in the Cincinnati area, has about 35 employees and makes components that wind up in products such as airplane brakes and gas station pumps, many of which are exported. He fears possible tariffs in response to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s potential trade policies. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ll have a smaller market now,<U+201D> Mr. Cunningham said. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t see how that is good for us.<U+201D> But referring to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s criticism of companies that move jobs overseas, he noted that his small company had already shifted production from China back to the U.S. <U+201C>Dodged a grenade,<U+201D> Mr. Cunningham said.

(If so, it will be the top of a lifetime, and I will discuss it more prospectively as it starts to play out.)<U+2026> IMPORTANT: To find out which company Doug Casey, Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that already has a staggering 18.1 million ounces of gold that just added another massive deposit and is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest gold opportunities in the world <U+2013> CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored \nThere is no way to know that for sure without more time passing, so it will be very instructive to see how bonds respond to stock market weakness when we finally get some. \nWhat Could Go Right? The size of the changes, while not absolutely large, have been quite dramatic given the nonexistent coupons. However, thus far that development has been completely ignored by equity markets the world over. Apparently, folks who have deserted the bond market because of no yield somehow seem to think their foray into stocks <U+2014> which may have been viewed as yield alternatives at the margin <U+2014> won<U+2019>t be impacted by declining bond prices. Which means that they are liable to be in for a very rude and large surprise<U+2026>eventually, whenever it matters. \nThat angst, though, certainly wasn<U+2019>t a feature of the early going today, as our market celebrated a variety of <U+201C>wins<U+201D> at beat-the-number in technology and the absolutely mindboggling takeover by Qualcomm of NXPI, whereby Qualcomm intends to add about $40 billion of debt onto a market cap of $100 billion. When the economic realities of all these policies that have been pursued eventually start to matter the chip sector, given all the debt that has been piled on, it is going to be a veritable financial black hole, but that is getting ahead of ourselves. \nTesla Says, <U+201C>Just Charge It<U+201D> Naturally, fun and games were rewarded, as Tesla spiked after supposedly reporting <U+201C>strong<U+201D> cash flow, although it closed just slightly higher. A friend who is involved pointed out that nowhere in the press release was it disclosed that the company<U+2019>s accounts payable exploded by $692 billion (although it was in the SEC filings), thereby creating the apparent improvement in cash flow. \nOut of Sight, Out of Mine However, winning at beat-the-number was not good enough for the miners, as for the most part they reported good results but went largely unrewarded. Both Agnico Eagle and Barrick reported strong results and continued improvement. Goldcorp was kind of <U+201C>in line,<U+201D> as its quarter was on the sluggish side, but that was pretty well known in advance and it looks like its operations are set to accelerate. The big clunker once again was Newmont, which is about par for the course for that company. Nevertheless, as noted, not being <U+201C>normal<U+201D> stocks, the results of the miners were ignored because the mood of the day is once again apathy toward mining and metals. \nIn the afternoon the indices slid a bit, led by the Nasdaq, which lost 0.6% while the Dow/S&P held up better. Away from stocks, green paper was higher, fixed income was hit pretty hard, with the long end especially weak. Oil rallied 1% and the metals were flattish. Included below are three questions and answers from the Q&A<U+2019>s with Bill Fleckenstein. Bonus Q&A Question: A friend of mine came into some money(not a lot but a lot for her),and knowing I used to trade full time asked me if I could give her any investment ideas. Sadly thanks to the FED all I could say is that there are no investments,only speculation(gold volatility is not for her). In a normal time I would have told her if she didn<U+2019>t need the money now buy a 1 year CD and pick up a little extra interest with no risk to principal-but what<U+2019>s the point now,since it would pay nothing. All I could say is leave it in the bank and if something changes and there is an opportunity,I<U+2019>ll tell her. The FED damage continues<U+2026>. Answer from Fleck: <U+201C> That will continue to be the case until the bond market finally breaks. And maybe, just maybe, that process has begun.<U+201D> Question: Hi Fleck <U+2013> Hope all is well. I recently came across this article that is an excellent read and wanted to share with the community on Blackrock<U+2019>s Alladin risk management platform. Excerpt: <U+201C>But <U+201C>Aladdin<U+201D>, the risk-management platform that occupies all those computers in the orchards, is not just used to look after BlackRock<U+2019>s $4 trillion. The firm makes its facilities available in whole or in part to managers looking after $11 trillion more, a tally that has recently been growing by about $1 trillion a year. All told, Aladdin keeps its eyes on almost 7% of the world<U+2019>s $225 trillion of financial assets. This is unprecedented<U+2014>and it means flaws in the system could matter to more than just BlackRock, its investors and its customers. If that much money is being managed by people who all think with the same tools, it may be managed by people all predisposed to the same mistakes.<U+201D> The monolith and the markets IMO, technology is the Achilles<U+2019> heel of the financial system now as well as human psychology via greed and fear. One day the rubber band will stretch the other way <U+2026>. and that time it will be an unprecedented reversion to the mean event. Answer from Fleck: <U+201C> In the next wipeout, computers will likely figure prominently, and not in a good way. <U+0001F642> Question: Fleck: GLD and SLV dance along or just above their 200 DMA while, for the most part, miners stuck in ugly downtrend channel bumping their heads their and/or at 50DMA and getting concussed back into their channels. Would you buy any more miners if they broke up and out of this downtrend in meaningful way (e.g., high volume) along with some follow-through? Sounds like you have full position in miners but would you get fuller? Regards Answer from Fleck: <U+201C> If I saw the exact right setup, I<U+2019>d probably add some exposure for a trade. <U+201C>Concussed?<U+201D> Geez, you take the price action kind of personally, I think.<U+201D> *** To subscribe to Bill Fleckenstein<U+2019>s fascinating Daily Thoughts CLICK HERE. \n***ALSO RELEASED: Legend Says This Will Translate Into A $100 Spike Overnight In Gold CLICK HERE. \n<U+00A9>",

He realized he needed to wait for the movie release and read the reviews to decide which one to watch first. \nOn Sunday morning, he recharged his internet data pack for a GB and looked up movie reviews on Google. He first opened NDTV<U+2019>s website where the reviewer Saibal Chatterjee gave Shivaay a 2 star rating, which was consistent with his usual ratings that range from 1.5 to 2.5.

I was the last speaker before they split for leave, then deployment to the Middle East just a few weeks before the holidays. But what I took away from my visit with those who are <U+201C>the first to fight<U+201D> was far more important than what I said. Whether the nation knows it or not, these incredible young men and women are going to war. And they are fully aware of war and its consequences. My escort officer, a bright young lieutenant colonel, was still shaken by the experience of serving as survival assistance officer to a family whose son was among 12 Marines who died in a tragic helicopter collision last January in Hawaii. A young Marine captain reminded me that the week before three American soldiers were gunned down at a check point in Jordan, one Middle Eastern country among many that will soon host members of his regiment. No matter where they are deployed, these men and women are full of the enthusiasm, grit and confidence that make American fighting forces so lethal. My favorite was Warrant Officer (Gunner) Keith Marine (no, really, that<U+2019>s his name). According to his regiment<U+2019>s commander, Gunner Marine is the finest infantryman in the Marine Corps. He<U+2019>s small, wiry, tough, full of wisdom and more than willing to lecture me on the complexities of the infantryman<U+2019>s art. If I were an Islamic State terrorist I wouldn<U+2019>t want him deployed anywhere near me. Yet while I know Gunner Marine is part of the best trained and equipped fighting force in the world, I wonder if there isn<U+2019>t more we can do for him and his comrades. My hope is that when allocating defense dollars, President-elect Trump, the next defense secretary and the new Congress will pay particular attention to the needs of men like Gunner Marine, the close-combat soldiers and Marines who do most of the actual fighting. Too often these front-line warriors are at the back of the line when our elected officials are debating what will or will not keep them alive. Too many Marines die by ambush. Why can<U+2019>t we buy them enough drones to hover constantly over them while on patrol? We spend over $100 million per fighter plane and millions more to train a single fighter pilot. Yet the last time a fighter pilot was killed in air-to-air combat was during the Vietnam War. By contrast, according to my analysis of recent Pentagon figures, the U.S. spends less than 1% of its military budget to equip and train men like Gunner Marine and his buddies. The last time a front-line soldier died in combat? Sadly, last week. On Thanksgiving Day a U.S. Special Forces soldier was killed by an improvised explosive device in northern Syria in the fight against ISIS. Teenagers tweet a zillion times a day, but when they join the Marine Corps they go to war virtually disconnected from their buddies. If rag pickers in Mumbai have cellphones, why can<U+2019>t we give every infantryman a cellphone so he can avoid the terrors of isolation on the battlefield? Commercial and military pilots are required to spend hours in multimillion-dollar simulators that replicate situations too hazardous to deal with in the air. So why can<U+2019>t young infantrymen be exposed to simulated combat environments before they are immersed in the most deadly and terror-filled experiences on the planet? Mr. Trump vows to increase the size of the Army and Marine Corps. Thank you. But the new administration must match bigger numbers with better materiel that will help keep our infantrymen alive. That includes sensors, night-vision devices, shoulder-fired antitank and antiaircraft missiles and new, lighter body armor. What is needed is relatively cheap. We can, for instance, issue every infantryman a rifle superior to the Soviet models in the hands of our enemies for the cost of a single F-35 fighter. A fully equipped infantryman costs about $20,000. Think how dominant we can make this same soldier or Marine for $50,000. That comes to $1.5 billion, half the cost of a Navy destroyer. So, Mr. Trump, please remember Gunner Marine and his mates when you sit down with your national security staff to prepare for tomorrow<U+2019>s wars. He<U+2019>s cheap. And well worth the expense.

The proposed settlement <U+2014> hammered out in negotiations among Trump lawyers, attorneys pressing federal class-action suits and New York Attorney General Schneiderman <U+2014> was announced just minutes before a federal judge in San Diego convened a hearing on whether to proceed with a jury trial in one of the cases just 10 days from now. Story Continued Below \"Today's $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university,\" Schneiderman said in a statement. \"I am pleased that under the terms of this settlement, every victim will receive restitution and that Donald Trump will pay up to $1 million in penalties to the State of New York for violating state education laws. The victims of Trump University have waited years for today's result and I am pleased that their patience <U+2014> and persistence <U+2014> will be rewarded by this $25 million settlement.\" Most of the money would go to former Trump University students who paid about $1,500 for a three-day seminar or as much as $35,000 for an in-person mentorship. In addition to the money going to New York state, some of the fund will also pay costs incurred by the lawyers who filed the suits, but the plaintiffs' lawyers agreed to forgo attorneys fees. The proposed settlement will lower the profile of the Trump University controversy by scuttling the jury trial set to open later this month. However, the deal itself would lead to further court hearings and litigation likely to drag on for months or even years. During the court hearing in San Diego Friday, a lawyer for Trump emphasized that the deal included no admission of liability on Trump's part. According to the Associated Press, Trump's lawyers said in a statement that they had \"no doubt\" he would prevail if the cases went to trial, but added \"resolution of these matters allows President-elect Trump to devote his full attention to the important issues facing our great nation.\" During the campaign, Trump repeatedly ruled out a settlement in the Trump University cases. \"Trump University has a 98% approval rating. I could have settled but won't out of principle,\" the GOP presidential candidate said on Twitter in February. \"I won't settle because it's an easy case to win in court,\" Trump told MSNBC a few days later. Lawyers for Trump and for the disgruntled students pursuing the federal suits did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Despite Trump's vow to take the case to trial, settlement talks intensified in the past week as Trump's team began to focus on the daunting load of transition-related duties the president-elect faces. U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who's presiding over the federal suits in San Diego, also prodded the two sides in those cases to meet with another judge to try to work out a settlement. Presidential Transition By Josh Gerstein Another factor accelerating the talks: one of the federal suits is set to go to a trial on the Monday after Thanksgiving, beginning with jury selection. Trump's side has asked that the trial be delayed, but Curiel has seemed intent to keep the trial in the 6-year-old case on track. A hearing the judge scheduled for 1:45 p.m. Pacific time on Friday on the delay request appeared to have spurred the sides to try to wrap up the deal. The agreement announced Friday is only a proposal for settling the case. Under federal law, notices of the settlement would be sent to former Trump University students, who could object to the deal or opt out of it. While the proposed settlement will likely do away with the pending trial, more court hearings would follow, including an initial court session to discuss the settlement and give it a preliminary OK. Curiel would likely entertain objections to the deal at yet another public hearing and ultimately have to rule on whether the settlement was fair. Then, any class members who objected could pursue appeals, delaying implementation of the settlement. The lawsuits claim that the marketing of Trump University misled students by claiming that the instructors were handpicked by Trump and that the school promised to teach his investing \"secrets.\" In fact, Trump has acknowledged he did not know most of the instructors. In addition, many of the techniques seem to have been publicly available in his books, which could be purchased for a fraction of the program's tuition or even taken out of a library for free. The suits also allege that Trump University was promoted as an accredited university even though it was not. In 2005, New York education officials sent the school a letter warning that it couldn't call itself a university without having accreditation. Trump officials promised to stop programs in New York, but later resumed them <U+2014> still using the Trump University name. By Bill Scher By Joshua Zeitz By Thomas Wright By Jack Shafer",

        "input": "time: null \n author: John V. Walsh \n source: lewrockwell.com \n text: By John V. Walsh October 31, 2016 \nEvery presidential vote, like every other vote, demands that one set priorities, for it is a rare voter indeed who will agree 100% with a given candidate. And surely in the coming presidential election survival must top the list of priorities. What can be more important than the survival of human civilization and perhaps humanity itself? \nHere is a brief primer on the subject <U+2013> suitable for printing out for liberal friends. \nNo Fly Zone over Syria \n<U+201C>I personally would be advocating now for a no-fly zone (inside Syria)<U+2026>.<U+201D> \nHillary Clinton interview , October 1, 2015, the day after Russia began air operations over Syria. Clinton has held this position since 2013 at least when she admitted it would <U+201C> kill a lot of Syrians .<U+201D> She has maintained it right up to the final presidential debate when she went <U+201C>all-in on Syria no-fly zone <U+201D> as the pro-Clinton Huffington Post headlined it. \n<U+201C>Right now, Senator, for us to control all the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war <U+2013> against Syria and Russia. That<U+2019>s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I<U+2019>m not going to make.<U+201D> \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford in Congressional testimony on September 22, 2016. Dunford<U+2019>s alarm is shared by other <U+201C>national security<U+201D> experts and those previously involved in implementing such zones. \n<U+201C>What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria. You<U+2019>re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton . <U+2026>You<U+2019>re not fighting Syria anymore, you<U+2019>re fighting Syria, Russia, and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk.<U+201D> (Emphasis, JW.) \nDonald Trump in Reuters interview on October 25, 2016, headlined <U+201C>Exclusive <U+2013> Trump says Clinton policy on Syria would lead to World War Three.<U+201D> \nSo there you are. It is not complicated. We have seen Clinton<U+2019>s actions over 26 and more years. She has not hesitated to kill hundreds of thousands and destroy entire countries. Libya and now Syria are but the latest examples. There is no doubt what she will do once in office. As Ralph Nader has said, she has never seen a war she did not love. Or as Trump has said, she is <U+201C>trigger happy.<U+201D> \nBroader U.S. Russia Relations \n<U+201C>Now if this sounds familiar (Putin<U+2019>s actions in Crimea, jw), it<U+2019>s what Hitler did back in the 30s<U+2026>..All the Germans that were <U+2026> the ethnic Germans, the Germans by ancestry who were in places like Czechoslovakia and Romania and other places, Hitler kept saying they<U+2019>re not being treated right. I must go and protect my people<U+2026>.<U+201D> \nHillary Clinton comments comparing Putin<U+2019>s actions to Hitler<U+2019>s at a private gathering, March, 2014 \n<U+201C>Mrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. \n<U+201C>Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation <U+2013> at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism. \n<U+201C>Naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world. \n<U+201C>If somebody out there wants confrontation, this is not our choice but this means that there will be problems.<U+201D> \nPresident Vladimir Putin addressing a group of journalists in Russia, October, 2016. \n<U+201C>Wouldn<U+2019>t it be nice if we actually got along with Russia and China and all these countries? Wouldn<U+2019>t it be nice?<U+201D> \nDonald Trump at a rally in Clinton, Iowa, January, 2016, stating a position that he has often voiced. \nMy progressive friends dismiss this and many other statements of Trump<U+2019>s with the easy rejoinder that Trump is inconsistent and opportunistic, that one cannot believe what he says. But his statements on Russia are quite consistent. And they are quite the opposite of opportunistic; they do not gain him votes, they have cost him votes. He stated his Russia-friendly position from the beginning in the Republican primaries, as for example in the statement above which was made in Iowa before the caucuses. That was no advantage to him. The Republican Party at that time was dominated by the neocons, and its Establishment remains hawkish to the present as John McCain, Mitt Romney, and many others demonstrate on a near daily basis. Trump has stuck with his position right up through the final presidential debate, even though his own vice presidential candidate has tried to pull him away from it and even though Hillary has used it as a club with which to beat him. There has been no inconsistency and it has been costly for him. That means you can take it to the bank as a matter of principle for him. \nIn fact, Trump has been as determined and consistent in seeking peace with Russia and Syria as Clinton has been in demonizing Putin and seeking a no-fly zone in Syria. That is a clear and striking difference between them. \nA testimony of great value to progressives \n<U+201C>On the issue of war and nuclear weapons, it is actually Hillary<U+2019>s policies which are much scarier than Donald Trump (sic) who does not want to go to war with Russia. He wants to seek modes of working together, which is the route that we need to follow not to go into confrontation and nuclear war with Russia.<U+201D> \nJill Stein, Green Party candidate for president, interview on October 12, 2016. \nIf, dear reader, you do not believe that Hillary will put us in a war situation with Russia to advance the power of the Indispensable Nation and the Exceptionals, then please read again the first three quotes at the beginning of this essay. In the absence of Hillary from his Cabinet, Obama has been wary about plunging into a misadventure in Syria. But Hillary does not hesitate when it comes to such bloody undertakings; she revels in them. \nAnd if you have priorities that outstrip the question of survival, then this essay will mean little to you. But I submit that most other questions pale into insignificance next to this one <U+2013> if not for you, then for your loved ones and for your fellow human beings. The Best of John V.

Thus, we forecast multiple <U+201C>fear actors<U+201D> rattling equity markets long after the US presidential elections. Therefore, we maintain our forecast that when gold prices stabilize above $1,400 per ounce, they will spike toward $2,000. \n  With Gold Hitting $1,300, Look At Who Is Bullish",

As a result, the truce was terminated, and the White House accuses the Kremlin of all mortal sins. \"This is simply a disgrace.

At the moment, Russia is keeping a pause in the Syrian Arab Republic.

Future 45<U+2019>s latest ad argues that the Democratic nominee cannot be trusted with the presidency as the Clinton Foundation has received millions of dollars from regimes around the world that persecute women and minorities. \nA source told Fox News that Adelson is considering contributing up to $25 million more as the White House race enters its final few days. \nIn May, Adelson bucked a substantial number of Republican Jews who opposed Trump <U+2014> even though by that time it was clear he would be the party<U+2019>s presidential nominee <U+2014> endorsing the pugnacious real estate magnate and reality TV star and appealing to other top Republican Jewish donors to follow suit. \nThe New York Times reported at the time that Adelson was prepared to spend up to $100 million to elect Trump, a greater sum than he has invested in previous elections. \nIn the following months, however, Adelson seemed to sour on Trump, instead focusing on congressional races amid fears of the Republicans losing control of Congress due to Trump<U+2019>s weak polling numbers and numerous controversial statements. He gave at least $40 million to super PACs focused solely on the fight for Congress, and the $10 million he initially dedicated to a pro-Trump super PAC was spent only on advertising in states with competitive Senate races. \nTrump<U+2019>s campaign has been plagued by charges of anti-Semitism, racism and sexism, and the nominee has been accused of running a divisive, hate-driven campaign. \nAdelson is a prominent donor to Jewish causes and a staunch supporter of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

        "input": "time: null \n author: WakingTimes \n source: wakingtimes.com \n text: Waking Times \nPresident Elect Trump is new title for New York businessman, millionaire and Republican candidate Donald J. Trump, who yesterday on November 8th, 2016 successfully won the US presidential election. Trump managed to defeat favorite Hillary Clinton by a relatively narrow margin. The victory came as a shock to many Americans, regardless of where they reside on the political spectrum. For many in the alternative media, the victory of President Elect Trump comes with a great sense of relief that career criminal Hillary Clinton was not elected (or installed) as so many had expected. Clinton had already showed a propensity to collude, cheat and lie during the Democratic Primaries where she triumphed with dirty tactics over Bernie Sanders. For many others, turned off by Trump<U+2019>s racism, sexism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and generally flippant comments, the Trump victory is devastating and will challenge them psychologically and emotionally to accept the reality for the results. Hillary Clinton: What Went Wrong? \nThe result is especially surprising given the degree to which Hillary Clinton had ingratiated herself with the upper echelons of the NWO (New World Order). From an outside perspective, it seemed Clinton had left no stone unturned in brown-nosing and sucking up to the most powerful people and organizations in the world, including the Rothschilds, Goldman Sachs, the Rockefeller CFR (Council on Foreign Relations) and many many more. Additionally, given her propensity for criminality and her powerful backers such as George Soros, coupled with the serious problems electronic voting machines possess in being able to be hacked and the vote flipped, many are left wondering how Hillary lost . What went wrong? \nAt this stage in the game of post-election analysis, we can point to a few things. Hillary<U+2019>s criminal past clearly caught up with her. It is unprecedented in the history of US presidential elections for a leading candidate to be under an on-again, off-again criminal investigation. Clinton simply has so many scandals in her recent and distant past that it<U+2019>s like trying to stop a ship with 30 holes from sinking; you can<U+2019>t plug them all. She was also running up against the problem that the Democrats had been in power for 8 years, when recent history shows that power seems to change hands in around that time frame. Clinton represented the establishment, and as the popularity of both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump has shown, people are tired of the same. They intuitively know the system is rigged and corrupt, even if they can<U+2019>t exactly put their fingers on it. Obama, Mr. <U+201C>Hope and Change<U+201D>, got in with a slick campaign of promising something different (upon which he didn<U+2019>t deliver). Trump represented anti-establishment, and whether he truly embodies that or not is an entirely different matter, because it<U+2019>s all about perception. Does a Trump Victory Show that NWO Powerbrokers Are Less in Control than It Seems? \nThe win of President Elect Trump is truly shocking and monumental event. Many people (including myself) were predicting that it was a foregone conclusion that Clinton would win. For instance, founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange stated before the election that <U+201C>Trump would not permitted to win<U+201D> . The MSM (Mainstream Media) were clearly favoring Clinton at almost every turn. Whatever you think of Trump, we can at least say the will of the majority of American voters was respected, which is a relief, given how much corruption exists in our society today. \nThe question now is this: is a Trump victory the result the NWO powerbrokers wanted all along, for reasons we are yet to see? Or is it a genuine uprising against these forces? What Does a Trump Presidency Mean for Liberty and Freedom? \nFor me, Trump can be summarized in one word: unpredictable . President Elect Trump truly embodies unpredictability more than any other high-level politician around. One moment he is railing against the 9/11 official story, then he is declaring his love for Israel, then he is bringing up the vaccine-autism connection, then he is suggesting Snowden be killed. Next he is suggesting GMO corn makes you stupid, then he suggesting Muslims be banned from the US , then he is calling global warming a hoax , then he is suggesting the Government be given the power to shut down the internet. Then, after all of that, he makes friendly overtures to Russia while demonizing the hell out of Iran. What does he stand for? Peace or war? Freedom or tyranny? \nAt this stage no one knows, probably not even Trump himself. He has contradicted himself numerous times throughout his campaign, and merely once suggesting a good idea (i.e. looking at who controls the issuance of money instead of letting the international bankers via the Federal Reserve control it) doesn<U+2019>t mean it will become his policy. Unpredictability is one of Trump<U+2019>s great qualities, but also one of his most dangerous. A lot will depend on with whom he surrounds himself once becoming President Trump, and what kind of advice they give him. His VP Mike Pence is a standard conservative Republican who will be no doubt far more to the liking of the NWO conspirators, but Trump is also taking advice from retired DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) chief Michael Flynn, the man who came out and highlighted how the US created ISIS in a declassified DIA document . \nFor now, America and the world have around two-and-a-half months to get over the incredible shock of yesterday<U+2019>s result and psychologically prepare itself for a Trump presidency. Meanwhile, it would be foolish for us to expect that one man can fix all of America<U+2019>s problems. It will be the job of the independent and alternative media to hold Trump to his promises and his word, and to continue to share ideas of how we can truly create a better, freer and more just society. This necessarily involves questioning the very structures and systems of society, and will never magically improve with just the passing of the baton from one politician to another.

The op-ed offers explanations about why some states offer early voting, and I express reasons how it can negatively effect an election. \nOf all my opinions given, the one that stands out most today is this one: Anything can happen in a presidential election. By voting early, early voters cut themselves short in the event something negative happens to the candidate they voted for. \nWith just ten days left until Nov. 8, it was revealed yesterday that Hillary Clinton is once again under FBI investigation for her private email server.

The best indicator of this is not gold, but silver: \n\nFrom PM Fund Manager Dave Kranzler : \nGold is powering higher because the dollar is dropping. The dollar index is down 1.7% in the last 3 1/2 trading sessions. It<U+2019>s down 2.3% vs the euro in the last 5 1/2 days, down 2.1% vs the yen in the last 3 days and down nearly 2% vs. the Swissie since Sunday night. \nThis is NOT about the political chaos connected to the U.S. election. That<U+2019>s a sideshow distraction to the real problems going on behind the scene. \nThe U.S. economy is starting to collapse. This is becoming glaringly evident from most of the data, notwithstanding the highly manipulated economic reports like auto sales. \nThe movement back into non-fiat assets is starting again <U+2013> anything connected to debt, like housing, is a de facto fiat asset. The best indicator of this is not gold, but silver. Silver was correlating with SPX for most of October, when the investment <U+201C>thesis<U+201D> was <U+201C>a strengthening economy is good for industrial metals.<U+201D> \nThe graph below illustrates this. It shows silver<U+2019>s movement vs. the SPX for the last 3 months: \nSilver correlated almost perfectly with the movement of the SPX for most of October (shaded area on the graph). But silver has moved up while the SPX has been selling off (including today, Nov 2nd) the past 4 trading sessions. This signals a switch from silver performing as an <U+201C>industrial<U+201D> metal to silver functioning as a <U+201C>monetary<U+201D> metal. \nCertainly based on the gold-silver ratio, silver is extraordinarily cheap to gold and thus represents a prototypical <U+201C>value<U+201D> trade as the markets begin to accept and reflect economic reality and reject the politically-charge propaganda about a <U+201C>healthy<U+201D> economy coming from the Fed, the White House and the Democratic candidates. \nIRD sponsor<U+2019>s the Mining Stock Journal , which provides unique commentary and insight into the precious metals and mining stock market.

        "input": "time: null \n author: MARK SCHMITT \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/opinion/trumps-capitol-hill-problem.html?_r=0 \n text: When thinking about any new president, and the harm or good he might do, we usually begin with his legislative agenda. The achievements that define a presidency often come early, so in the traditional model, a president rides the momentum of electoral success by quickly moving an ambitious agenda through Congress. It won<U+2019>t all happen in 100 days as in Franklin D. Roosevelt<U+2019>s time, but typically there<U+2019>s only a short window for a president to get his proposals passed before attention shifts to the midterm campaigns. It<U+2019>s doubtful that Donald J. Trump has even a grade-school civics class idea of how a bill becomes a law, so it<U+2019>s long been assumed that his legislative agenda will be House Speaker Paul Ryan<U+2019>s. The speaker will get his bills passed, with Republican control of both houses of Congress, and Mr. Trump will sign them. No doubt Mr. Ryan has an agenda; it<U+2019>s in the budgets he proposed starting in 2011, as chairman of the House Budget Committee, and most recently in a pamphlet called <U+201C> A Better Way ,<U+201D> copies of which he is never without. Each year, a high priority for him has been a sweeping reform of Medicare, establishing a system in which some older Americans would get a voucher to buy health coverage on the open market. Mr. Ryan would also like to convert Medicaid to block grants to states, repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and enact major reform of both individual and corporate taxation. Mr. Ryan probably has enough votes for these changes <U+2014> he did get his budgets passed in the House <U+2014> but even so, the path from these rough outlines to legislation a president can sign is inevitably long and treacherous. Some Republicans worried about re-election will resist the Medicare changes, which hit their base of older voters, and Democrats should and will mobilize to make this unpopular change a 2018 election issue. Other members will demand alterations in his proposals to benefit a company in their district, or a big campaign donor. If Mr. Ryan<U+2019>s Medicaid block grants aren<U+2019>t as generous to states as the current system, some Republican governors will object, backed up by their representatives. Accommodating them will require spending more money, defeating Mr. Ryan<U+2019>s original purpose. Repealing the Affordable Care Act might seem like a one-sentence bill, but Mr. Trump and many members of Congress have said they want to keep its popular provisions, such as the requirement to cover pre-existing conditions. Insurers will balk at that requirement in the absence of either the mandate or federal subsidies, which discourage people from postponing buying health insurance until they get sick. The health care act is interconnected in ways that will make it hard to separate the popular provisions from the unpopular, and in seven years, Republicans still haven<U+2019>t filled in the blank second part of <U+201C>repeal and replace.<U+201D> Problems like these will appear all along the way, as any major bill winds through one or more committees in each house, is amended on each floor and finally consolidated into a single bill for the president. Hundreds of lobbyists will converge on the process, pitching modifications large, small and often contradictory. There will be dozens of conflicts to resolve and choices to make. That will be true of tax as well as health legislation <U+2014> the Republican House couldn<U+2019>t get a major tax reform to the floor in 2014, even after Dave Camp, the Michigan Republican who led the House Ways and Means Committee, spent years on the details. Read any of the long books written about significant legislative victories, and even with one-party control, it<U+2019>s always a high-wire act, full of moments when leaders pull the bill back from the brink of failure or force difficult votes. Keeping the process on track requires a president who is fully engaged, making calls to the Hill, intervening to resolve conflicts, and providing technical support through competently staffed federal agencies. It helps a lot if the president is popular and members want to be associated with him; Ronald Reagan<U+2019>s approval rating was almost 60 percent around the time Congress enacted his sweeping tax and budget cuts in 1981. Even right after the election, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s favorability ratings were comparable to Richard M. Nixon<U+2019>s in the depths of Watergate, and he lost the popular vote. Nor does Mr. Trump have warm relationships with members of Congress. Most have never met him, and others he has viciously attacked. Mr. Trump does have the roughest outlines of a legislative agenda of his own: <U+201C>rebuild our infrastructure,<U+201D> <U+201C>fix our inner cities.<U+201D> Democrats welcome the idea of infrastructure spending and have said they would work with the new president to achieve it. But it<U+2019>s far from Mr. Ryan<U+2019>s priorities, and conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus will object to the increased federal spending. There<U+2019>s also no precedent for a new president to work mainly with the minority party to devise a bill. The agenda is set by the majority. Yes, Senate Republicans may eliminate the filibuster or do as much as possible through the process of budget reconciliation, so they won<U+2019>t necessarily need 60 votes for final passage of a bill. But that<U+2019>s only one of many obstacles along the way, and with just one vote to spare, getting to 50 can be as hard as getting to 60 was during the brief period when Mr. Obama had the advantage of a Senate majority <U+2014> he still had to convince wavering Democratic senators like Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who demanded the much-derided <U+201C>Cornhusker kickback.<U+201D> To be clear, there is much to fear from the incoming administration. Especially with the modern powers of the presidency, Mr. Trump can do staggering damage to the country and the world through judicial and other appointments, by not enforcing existing regulations, or by issuing executive orders. With Mr. Trump, there<U+2019>s the additional danger that he will use federal power to go after perceived enemies or mishandle any of the dozens of national security issues that will fill his daily briefing book. Let those things keep you awake at night. But the idea that Donald Trump will become a master of the legislative process is one small thing we probably don<U+2019>t have to worry about.

Insider Says Obama Might Disclose UFO Truth Before January 2017 Nov 18, 2016 6 0 \nSteven Basset is the only registered UFO disclosure lobbyist in Washington D.C. and just yesterday, he made a public announcement that is very timely indeed. Steven runs the Paradigm Research Group , which lobbies for the official political announcement disclosing the truth about the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon that the U.S. government has been covering up for decades. Steven Basset has pushed for disclosure for over 20 years in Washington D.C. \nIn a press release from November 17th, 2016, Basset said the Paradigm Research Group was contacted by a source within the military/intelligence community and that the basis of the message was that the <U+201C>persons who are directly involved in the management of the extraterrestrial issues want Disclosure to take place under President Obama and are ready to work with the Secretary of Defense if approached.<U+201D> \nBasset goes on to explain that the Paradigm Research Group has publicly stated before that the Clinton team has had an agenda to disclose to the world the existence of extraterrestrial beings if she became president. Since she lost the presidential race, that is no longer an option, but instead, may force the issue to happen quicker and while Barack Obama is still president: \n<U+201C>The Clintons now have a choice to make of historic proportions. Should they immediately take interviews with top journalists and discuss in greater detail what they know about the ET issue and what transpired during the Rockefeller Initiative from 1993-1996 , the resulting media storm will force the Pentagon and the White House to reach the necessary understanding allowing Barack Obama to be the Disclosure president. Or should they remain silent and allow the truth embargo to continue on into the next administration.<U+201D> When will the truth be announced? \nWhile the amount of information and steps needed for the Secretary of Defense to brief the White House is immense, Steven says the pressure is building quickly for Obama to be the one to make the historic announcement: \nIn order for the Secretary of Defense to approach the White House regarding Disclosure, he must reach down into the military/intelligence complex for the needed information to proceed. Although the managers of the ET issues are constrained by the highest level of classification, Paradigm Research Group is convinced they are ready to provide that information because there is a growing internal consensus Disclosure must take place under President Obama. \nThis process is time sensitive. Disclosure would need to happen early enough for the nation [and world] to absorb such extraordinary information and settle down prior to the inauguration. There would also be time to prepare various government agencies for the engagement of the media and the public going forward. Then the new president would be stepping into a relatively stable and organized post-Disclosure status. \nWith this in mind, Paradigm Research Group would assert Disclosure after January 6th, 2017 would not be a responsible option. The means the Clintons have a choice to make and a few weeks to reach a decision.<U+201D> \nWhile some may still be skeptics of the notion that there are other beings in our universe, we must keep in mind the number of insiders who have revealed what they know as well as the positions they<U+2019>ve held to acquire such knowledge. As we reported earlier today , full UFO disclosure is inevitable. With former NASA astronauts, physicists, scientists, engineers and high ranking military personnel blowing the whistle for several decades now, we see that the world is getting closer to learning the truth. \nWith respect to this announcement from Paradigm Research Group just yesterday, we must keep a couple things in mind. First, in the grand scheme of the disclosure process, it is not crucially important if this announcement takes place under Obama before Trump<U+2019>s inauguration in late January of 2017. If such an announcement is not made before then, we mustn<U+2019>t believe the push for disclosure is or has been a failure. We must keep in mind the bigger picture and specifically the words from the press release, <U+201C>there is a growing internal consensus Disclosure must take place<U+2026><U+201D> That is what is important. It<U+2019>s the fact that there is such momentum and pressure building within the political and military/intelligence community for this announcement to be made public. \nWhat are your thoughts about this latest announcement? Will Obama be the disclosing president? Or will Trump? Or will some other world leader make the announcement? When do you think it will happen? \nLance Schuttler graduated from the University of Iowa with a degree in Health Science and does health coaching through his website Orgonlight Health .

Alpert \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/bloomberg-changes-businessweek-leaders-ends-political-tv-program-1479414097 \n text: Bloomberg LP announced a series of changes across its news organization on Thursday, including a revamp and new leadership at its money-losing magazine Bloomberg Businessweek and the end of its high-priced political news program, <U+201C>With All Due Respect.<U+201D> In addition, approximately 30 Bloomberg News journalists were let go Thursday across the U.S., Europe and Asia as part of an effort to merge the company<U+2019>s Bloomberg First Word and markets news teams, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg employs about 2,600 journalists and analysts world-wide. A new version of Bloomberg Businessweek will launch toward the end of the second quarter next year, Bloomberg Editor in Chief John Micklethwait and Bloomberg Media Chief Executive Justin Smith wrote in a memo to staff. The revamp is necessary because its business model is <U+201C>too reliant<U+201D> on print advertising, which is in rapid decline industrywide. A person familiar with the matter said the publication, which Bloomberg acquired in 2009, was on pace to lose between $20 million and $30 million this year. The magazine<U+2019>s business model has <U+201C>not evolved as quickly as the market around it<U+2014>and does not have enough of a focus on digital innovation,<U+201D> Mr. Micklethwait and Mr. Smith wrote. <U+201C>Working out the exact details of this new BBW is the job of the next few months. But we are already clear that it requires deep change.<U+201D> The memo said the magazine<U+2019>s editor, Ellen Pollock, and her deputy, Brad Wieners, would be leaving the company. Ms. Pollock will be succeeded by Washington Bureau Chief Megan Murphy. The move comes as newspapers and magazines struggle with an accelerating decline of print advertising revenue that has led to staffing cutbacks across the industry. The Wall Street Journal recently offered buyouts and began laying off staffers amid a 21% ad revenue decline; the New York Times has similarly warned of staff reductions next year; and Gannett Co. recently laid off around 380 staffers across its approximately 120 newspaper properties. In a separate memo on Thursday, Bloomberg said its daily political show, <U+201C>With All Due Respect,<U+201D> would draw to a close on Dec. 2 as the company revamps its political coverage after the U.S. election. The show launched in 2014 with the big-ticket hires of well-known Beltway chroniclers, John Heilemann and Mark Halperin. For the rest of the year, the show<U+2019>s team will focus on producing a series of hourlong features previewing the presidency of Donald Trump. After the inauguration, Bloomberg said it would look to launch a new show focused on global politics. The company said it would similarly transition the focus of its political coverage on the web more globally and that Messrs. Heilemann and Halperin would step back from full-time roles but continue as contributors and columnists. Write to Lukas I. Alpert at lukas.alpert@wsj.com",

Priorities USA Action raked in $18 million from Oct. 1 to Oct. 19, according to its latest report with the Federal Election Commission, the last glimpse before the election. That's more than the group raised in any full month except August and September. The influx helped fuel a $24.8 million spending spree in the same period. Story Continued Below The top donors were Susan Mandel, the Connecticut philanthropist who gave $2.5 million to match her husband's October gift, and Dustin Moskovitz, the Facebook co-founder whose $2.5 million contribution rounded out the unprecedented $35 million he has spent against Donald Trump. Newsweb chairman Fred Eychaner gave $2 million. Hedge fund manager James Simon and his wife, Marilyn, both gave $1.5 million. Hyatt heirs Jay Robert and Mary Kathryn Pritzker each gave $1.25 million, bringing their combined tally to $13.3 million. Donald Sussman gave $1 million, bringing his total to $17.5 million. By Isaac Arnsdorf Priorities USA used the money to spread $2 million around other allied super PACs and reserve $1.5 million in digital ads, $751,000 on the radio and $532,000 on TV.

Trump , or really the entire Republican Party for that matter. Yet the polls conducted this week, after the second presidential debate on Sunday, have not been apocalyptic. To be clear, the most recent polls are very bad news for him. He trails by a considerable margin <U+2014> perhaps by around seven percentage points nationwide, based on state and national polls over the last few days. There is no precedent for a such a large comeback in a modern presidential election with around three weeks to go. That doesn<U+2019>t mean it can<U+2019>t happen; The Upshot model gives him an 11 percent chance of winning. But the more relevant question now is whether he will lose by a landslide margin and in the sort of wave that would swamp Republicans in the Senate and even jeopardize Republican control of the House. A wave election seemed possible after Mr. Trump was heard bragging about groping women in a videotape, causing many Republican officials to withdraw their endorsements. It seemed it might be imminent after an NBC/WSJ poll showed Hillary Clinton with a double-digit lead soon after the video<U+2019>s release. But there aren<U+2019>t yet many signs that the bottom has fallen out for either Mr. Trump or the Republican Senate candidates in key states like Florida, Ohio, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Nevada and Missouri. Notably, even less popular senators <U+2014> like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Richard Burr of North Carolina <U+2014> have held up fairly well in polling this week. On balance, the race looks more or less the way it did a week ago. The same thing seems to be true in the House. There aren<U+2019>t many public House polls, but the Cook Political Report updated its race ratings Friday, and there are still just 33 Republicans in either <U+201C>lean<U+201D> or <U+201C>tossup<U+201D> seats. It<U+2019>s a very different story from 2006, when the number of competitive House seats quickly surged after revelations that Mark Foley, a Republican congressman, had send lewd messages to a former congressional page. The Republicans aren<U+2019>t in the clear quite yet. The biggest warning sign: a big drop-off in the G.O.P.<U+2019>s standing in the generic congressional ballot. The NBC/WSJ and Fox polls both showed Democrats building six-point leads, up from a one-point lead in the Fox poll and a three-point lead in the NBC/WSJ poll (the prior NBC/WSJ poll was among registered voters). There are reasons to consider whether things could get worse for the Republicans. For one, Mr. Trump may not have hit bottom <U+2014> not with a steady stream of women coming forward claiming that he groped or kissed them without consent. And so far in this election, it has generally taken a week or two for big shifts to take hold <U+2014> whether it was Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s post-convention bounce or her post-debate bounce. But let<U+2019>s suppose this is as bad as it gets for Mr. Trump, and let<U+2019>s say the final polls say the same thing they do now. Even then, it would be hard for the Republicans to feel too comfortable. The number of undecided and minor-party voters is very high. These voters have not yet been swayed to support Mrs. Clinton or the Democrats. But they have probably never supported Mr. Trump, they view him very unfavorably, and an overwhelming majority don<U+2019>t believe he<U+2019>s qualified to be president. The possibility that they could disproportionately break to Mrs. Clinton <U+2014> and the Democrats <U+2014> seems very plausible.

This energy allows the Spiritual realm to have contact with you. It is important to take responsibility for your personal vibration, raising it so you may meet with the universal energies and receive communication directly from your Higher self , the Angels and Ascended Masters, and other Light Beings. \nThe higher your personal vibration, the easier it is for the Spiritual realm to make contact with you. The Angels, Ascended Masters and Other Light Beings vibrate at a much higher vibration than Humans. \nTo make contact on a more regular basis, you must raise your personal vibration. This can be done in a number of ways. \nMeditation is a common way of raising your vibration. You are able to raise your vibration by bringing your attention to your thoughts. The purer the thoughts the higher your vibration. So remove all negative thought patterns and replace them with positive thoughts. \nPractice of this exercise is all that is needed, then it will become second nature and you will notice other things within your life change as your create a stronger more purer vibration within your energy field. \nYou will only attract vibrations to your energy field that are of the same resonance. \nExercise is another way to raise your vibration. Not only does exercise create a healthy body, it creates a healthy mind. When you exercise, your body releases feel good endorphines, when you feel good, you raise your vibration. \nFind some activity that makes you feel good and go for it. \nEat good quality food and drink pure water, what you put into your body will also affect your energy , so treat yourself kindly. \nBeing with friends and those that make us feel Loved and appreciated will also help raise our vibration. Surround yourself with loving friends and family. You can create a spiritual family who will help you and support your vibrational evolution. \nWe have been taught that we need to raise our awareness up toward the Heavens for ascension . It is my belief, that we need to raise our personal vibration to resonate with the vibration of our Higher self. \nOnce we have reached this point of unison, we must then bring our Higher self closer to the Earth. Bringing Heaven to Earth. This will bring a vibration of purity closer to Earth and help her raise her vibration in preparation for the cosmic shift. \nWe all have an important role to play here. We can all start raising our personal vibration so we are able to unite our physical energies with our Higher self<U+2019>s energies, thus creating Heaven on Earth. \nIn order for this to be successful, We must strenghten our Lower three chakras to help anchor the higher vibrations . \nEarthly activities are important. Remember to be in the present moment as this helps to strenghten the lower three chakras. \nDance, Laugh, pay attention to the mundane activities that tie you to the Earthly experience. This will strenghthen your connection to these chakras. \nImagine your Lower three Chakras as the Root system to a very Large tree. \nThe stronger the root system, the stronger the tree. Like the tree, the roots stabilize the tree so it may grow strong and healthy. \nThe root system is equally as large underground as is the tree and its folage above ground. This is a great way to image your chakra system. \nThe Lower three chakras are the roots to your tree, the heart chakra is the midpoint, the joining of the energies, and the upper three chakras are your tree trunk, branches and folage. How strong is the root system to your tree? \nGive yourself permission to engage in activities to help strengthen your connection to these vital chakras. \nHere is a little exercise to help anchor your Higher energies into Mother Earth. \nSit on the Earth, place your hands firmly on the ground. Now take a moment to breath, connecting with rise and fall of your breath knowing as you breath, you are connecting with the universal breath. \nNow, have a sense of pulling the energy of the Universe down through your Crown Chakra. Bring this energy down through your brow chakra, then your throat chakra and feel it connect to your Heart chakra. \nLet this energy rest within your Heart charka for a moment. Now let the energies travel down through your arms and into your hands. Feel this energy build as a warmth or tingling sensation within your hands. \nConnect with Mother Earth and allow this energy to move through you and deep into Mother Earth. Feel this, see this, allow this exchange of energy from the universe through your hands to Mother Earth. \nAs this energy is allowed to be transfered, say<U+201D> I bless you and thank you, Our Beloved Mother Earth, in the name of All that is.<U+201D> \nWhen you feel you are finished exchanging energies, bring your awareness back to your breath and allow the universal energies to return to their origin, knowing you can connect again at YOUR divine will. \nYou will feel refreshed and energised as your energy is refined through the universal energy exchange. \nThis exercise can be done on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. If on a monthly basis, I would suggest either on the full moon or the new moon. \nThe more we connect with the universal energies and allow an exchange of energy between earth and the universe, the higher our personal vibration will become. The higher our personal vibration and the more intune with the universe we become, the greater the flow of Love and Harmony to humanity. SF Source Dreamcatcher Reality Nov. 2016 Share this:",

Trump and many Republicans have denied the reality of climate change; they favor more tax cuts for the rich; they want to deregulate Wall Street and other powerful industries <U+2013> all policies that helped create the current mess that the United States and much of the world are now in. A sign supporting Donald Trump at a rally at Veterans Memorial Coliseum at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix, Arizona.

He lacks the knowledge and the temperament that one would like to see in a President <U+2013> or even in a much less powerful public official. He appealed to racism, misogyny, white supremacy, bigotry toward immigrants and prejudice toward Muslims. He favors torture and wants a giant wall built across America<U+2019>s southern border. \nBut American voters chose him in part because they felt they needed a blunt instrument to smash the Establishment that has ruled and mis-ruled America for at least the past several decades. It is an Establishment that not only has grabbed for itself almost all the new wealth that the country has produced but has casually sent the U.S. military into wars of choice, as if the lives of working-class soldiers are of little value. \nOn foreign policy, the Establishment had turned decision-making over to the neoconservatives and their liberal-interventionist sidekicks, a collection of haughty elitists who often subordinated American interests to those of Israel and Saudi Arabia, for political or financial advantage. \nThe war choices of the neocon/liberal-hawk coalition have been disastrous <U+2013> from Iraq to Afghanistan to Libya to Syria to Ukraine <U+2013> yet this collection of know-it-alls never experiences accountability. The same people, including the media<U+2019>s armchair warriors and the think-tank <U+201C>scholars,<U+201D> bounce from one catastrophe to the next with no consequences for their fallacious <U+201C>group thinks.<U+201D> Most recently, they have ginned up a new costly and dangerous Cold War with Russia. \nFor all his faults, Trump was one of the few major public figures who dared challenge the <U+201C>group thinks<U+201D> on the current hot spots of Syria and Russia. In response, Clinton and many Democrats chose to engage in a crude McCarthyism with Clinton even baiting Trump as Vladimir Putin<U+2019>s <U+201C>puppet<U+201D> during the final presidential debate. \nIt is somewhat remarkable that those tactics failed; that Trump talked about cooperation with Russia, rather than confrontation, and won. Trump<U+2019>s victory could mean that rather than escalating the New Cold War with Russia, there is the possibility of a ratcheting down of tensions. \nRepudiating the Neocons \nThus, Trump<U+2019>s victory marks a repudiation of the neocon/liberal-hawk orthodoxy because the New Cold War was largely incubated in neocon/liberal-hawk think tanks, brought to life by likeminded officials in the U.S. State Department, and nourished by propaganda across the mainstream Western media.

(Photo by Gage Skidmore) \nIt was the West, not Russia, that provoked the confrontation over Ukraine by helping to install a fiercely anti-Russian regime on Russia<U+2019>s borders. I know the mainstream Western media framed the story as <U+201C>Russian aggression<U+201D> but that was always a gross distortion. \nThere were peaceful ways for settling the internal differences inside Ukraine without violating the democratic process, but U.S. neocons, such as Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, and wealthy neoliberals, such as financial speculator George Soros, pushed for a putsch that overthrew the elected President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. \nPutin<U+2019>s response, including his acceptance of Crimea<U+2019>s overwhelming referendum to return to Russia and his support for ethnic Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine opposing the coup regime in Kiev, was a reaction to the West<U+2019>s destabilizing and violent actions. Putin was not the instigator of the troubles. \nSimilarly, in Syria, the West<U+2019>s <U+201C>regime change<U+201D> strategy, which dates back to neocon planning in the mid-1990s, involved collaboration with Al Qaeda and other Islamic jihadists to remove the secular government of Bashar al-Assad. Again, Official Washington and the mainstream media portrayed the conflict as all Assad<U+2019>s fault, but that wasn<U+2019>t the full picture. \nFrom the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, U.S. <U+201C>allies,<U+201D> including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Israel, have been aiding the rebellion, with Turkey and the Gulf states funneling money and weapons to Al Qaeda<U+2019>s Nusra Front and even to the Al Qaeda spinoff, Islamic State. \nThough President Barack Obama dragged his heels on the direct intervention advocated by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama eventually went in halfway, bending to political pressure by agreeing to train and arm so-called <U+201C>moderates<U+201D> who ended up fighting next to Al Qaeda<U+2019>s Nusra Front and other jihadists in Ahrar al-Sham. \nTrump has been inarticulate and imprecise in describing what policies he would follow in Syria, besides suggesting that he would cooperate with the Russians in destroying Islamic State. But Trump didn<U+2019>t seem to understand the role of Al Qaeda in controlling east Aleppo and other Syrian territory. \nUncharted Territory \nSo, the American voters have plunged the United States and the world into uncharted territory behind a President-elect who lacks a depth of knowledge on a wide variety of issues. Who will guide a President Trump becomes the most pressing issue today. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaking with supporters at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. March 21, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) \nWill he rely on traditional Republicans who have done so much to mess up the country and the world or will he find some fresh-thinking realists who will realign policy with core American interests and values. \nFor this dangerous and uncertain moment, the Democratic Party establishment deserves a large share of the blame. Despite signs that 2016 would be a year for an anti-Establishment candidate <U+2013> possibly someone like Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders <U+2013> the Democratic leadership decided that it was <U+201C>Hillary<U+2019>s turn.<U+201D> \nAlternatives like Warren were discouraged from running so there could be a Clinton <U+201C>coronation.<U+201D> That left the 74-year-old socialist from Vermont as the only obstacle to Clinton<U+2019>s nomination and it turned out that Sanders was a formidable challenger. But his candidacy was ultimately blocked by Democratic insiders, including the unelected <U+201C>super-delegates<U+201D> who gave Clinton an early and seemingly insurmountable lead. \nWith blinders firmly in place, the Democrats yoked themselves to Clinton<U+2019>s gilded carriage and tried to pull it all the way to the White House. But they ignored the fact that many Americans came to see Clinton as the personification of all that is wrong about the insular and corrupt world of Official Washington. And that has given us President-elect Trump. \nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Peter Lee \n source: unz.com \n text: \nAs I discuss in my most recent piece for Asia Times, Duterte v. United States: The Empire Slaps Back , I find the US tunnel vision concerning Asian attitudes toward engagement with China puzzling. \nThe big story in Asia IMO is the smaller powers trying to integrate with the PRC economically while keeping it at arms<U+2019> length militarily, but that doesn<U+2019>t seem to drive the coverage I see. Perhaps as a function of that <U+201C>salary depends on not understanding<U+201D> Mark Twain crack, US diplos/generals/journos/wonks seem determined to ignore the centripetal forces at play in Asia with China at their heart. \nThere<U+2019>s also a gigantic blind spot in US coverage of the Philippines. If you read the papes, everybody in the Philippines is staring anxiously out at the South China Sea for <U+201C>Chizilla<U+201D> to emerge and wreak havoc on a jewel of Pacific democracy. \nActually, if you read my piece, you<U+2019>ll find that the forces ravaging the Philippines are poverty, inequality, social division, corruption, and the occasional megatyphoon and I have an idea the reason that Fidel Ramos championed Duterte is because he saw him as the one candidate who would focus on domestic issues and not pivot-friendly bullsh*t. \nThe US story is that the threat of <U+201C>China rising<U+201D> must be contained militarily, its economic reach reduced, and Asia should look for a <U+201C>high standards<U+201D> trade bloc, TPP, for its growth story instead of canoodling with the Chicoms. \nHowever, I think the CCP read its George Kennan and realized the containment strategy worked on the USSR because the Soviets thought, incorrectly, they could cut it as an autarky. Deng knew different, enabled inward and outward investment, and now we<U+2019>re looking at not only Asia but much of the world anxious at how Chinese trouble will play out in their own economies. \nIn my opinion, the US was only able to establish <U+201C>China threat<U+201D> as the top element on the Asian FP agenda temporarily, with considerable effort, and only by the active support of pro-US government officials in Japan and the Philippines who were willing to assist in engineering polarizing provocations with the PRC around the Senkakus and Scarborough Shoal. \nNow the economic logic of Asian integration i.e. hoovering up the cash the PRC is willing to throw at the region is reasserting itself. \nThailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam, and now the Philippines are showing via engagement with China that their participation in any US crusade is conditional and equivocal. \nThese countries are not democratic and human rights garden spots, so I guess the US could summon up some <U+201C>birds of a feather<U+201D> grumbling about why the jefes of these regimes are willing to cozy up to dictators instead of joining the crusade to contain, isolate, and degrade the PRC regime (and heroically put their own economic well-being at risk at the same time). \nAnd then there<U+2019>s this guy: \nThat<U+2019>s Shinzo Abe making nice with Rodrigo Duterte during Duterte<U+2019>s recent visit to Japan. Actually, making the <U+201C>iron fist<U+201D>, the symbol of Duterte<U+2019>s, shall we say, rather harsh vision of how to make Philippine democracy do the right thing <U+201C>or I<U+2019>ll punch the crap outta you. Or worse.<U+201D> \nI just love this picture. I don<U+2019>t recall seeing it in US coverage of Duterte<U+2019>s foray into Japan. \nUS tunnel vision was in full force again, focused on the fact that Duterte said he wanted foreign militaries a.k.a. the US outta the Philippines in two years. \nBut the big story was, to paraphrase Sherlock Holmes, <U+201C>the dog that didn<U+2019>t snarl.<U+201D> Japan. \nAbe reciprocated Duterte<U+2019>s outreached fist, one might say, with his own, and competed with the PRC in offering various goodies to the Philippines. \nAbe<U+2019>s Japan, as I comment in my Asia Times piece, has a rather multi-jointed agenda. \nJapan was in a pretty solid space, securitywise, if it was content to remain a security ward of the United States under the pacifist constitution. But ideology, opportunity, and necessity are driving Japan back into Asia as a security actor. \nAbe, a revisionist nationalist (i.e. he rejects the victor<U+2019>s justice narrative of World War II that Japan did wrong and deserved to be militarily neutered), is piggybacking on the pivot to enable Japan<U+2019>s re-emergence as a full-fledged Asian power with an extensive network of relationships cum allies in East and South Asia. \nChina<U+2019>s rise is an indispensable element in Japan<U+2019>s rise. \nThe, let<U+2019>s face it, hulking and goonish face of PRC regional engagement promotes a search for capable friends, and most Asian countries are pretty happy to have Japan in their corner<U+2014>and not too upset about Japan<U+2019>s return to the fray as a full-fledged military power. \nSecond, after the United States signed on to the <U+201C>China threat<U+201D> narrative as the driver for its Asia pivot (something that Kurt Campbell, Hillary Clinton, and Seiji Maehara cahooted on in 2010), the US abandoned the honest broker position it had claimed in previous decades and lined up behind Japan and provided material, operational, and diplomatic support for the expansion of Japan<U+2019>s military footprint in Asia. \nHowever, I believe that Japanese strategists regard US anti-China resolve as a wasting asset, not just subject to the vagaries of American politics and conflicting economic/fiscal/trade priorities that undercut the containment strategy, but also because the ineluctable logic of Asian growth is sidelining the US as hegemon of the anti-China alliance. \nThere is likely to come a day when the US faces its Suez moment and admits it<U+2019>s not ready to fight a war in the west Pacific to protect US interests and sustain US prestige. \nThat day is unlikely to come under the Clinton administration<U+2014>which has preemptively committed itself to a policy of sustaining US global pre-eminence through the application of military force as needed<U+2014>and that, depending on your appetite for combat with the Chicoms 8000 miles from home, is either a good or bad thing. \nBut the day will probably come and if and when it does, Japan does not want to be standing there helplessly holding its daikon (as it did when Nixon went to China). Instead, it<U+2019>s going to be militarily strong, probably with a Israel-style covert nuclear weapons capability it will discretely brandish, and with a strong regional network of friends and allies in East Asia. \nI think a Japan-centric security regime facing China but complemented by regional economic integration is sustainable; I think a US-centric system based on forestalling economic integration and keeping allies submissive by maintaining a nuclear <U+201C>umbrella<U+201D> a.k.a. monopoly is not. \nWe may de facto be heading towards such a regime, even as the Clinton administration continues its hypernationalist bluster. There<U+2019>s the nibbling away at the pivot by the smaller and weaker allies, there<U+2019>s Abe with Duterte and, if I<U+2019>m reading Paul Krugman<U+2019>s tea leaves correctly, it appears that President Clinton may give up on TPP as an Obama pipe dream. \nNot to say peace and reduced tensions are in the offing for East Asia; particularly, if I was Duterte I<U+2019>d watch my back as the Clinton administration will probably seek to punish his lese majeste toward the United States much more than the lame-duck Obama administration. And, I imagine the U.S. Navy will demand more of its precious FONOPs in order to provoke the Chinese, hopefully to the point of a confrontation that feeds the security polarization narrative and fattens its budget. \nBut the general trend seems to be away from Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s goal of <U+201C>America<U+2019>s Pacific Century<U+201D> toward <U+201C>The Pacific<U+2019>s Pacific Century<U+201D> and I think that<U+2019>s a pretty good thing.

While it is unclear whether that meeting ever took place, the offer, mentioned in one of thousands of hacked Clinton campaign emails released by WikiLeaks last week, was an example of the complex ethical issues the Clinton Foundation faced in managing relationships with foreign governments when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. It also raised questions about whether the foundation had fully followed procedures it had voluntarily agreed to in order to avoid those very issues. The foundation<U+2019>s ties to foreign governments and financiers have long been fodder for Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s critics <U+2014> chief among them Donald J. Trump <U+2014> who contend that foreigners used donations to the foundation to curry favor with the Clintons while Mrs. Clinton was the country<U+2019>s top diplomat. Emails released this year from Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s time at the State Department showed that foundation donors sought and in some cases obtained meetings with department officials. None showed that Mrs. Clinton made decisions based on contributions to the foundation, and the Clinton campaign has said she never did. But the appearance of special access was enough that the foundation announced this summer that if Mrs. Clinton is elected president, the foundation will cease accepting foreign donations. Similar concerns were in the air in 2009, when Mrs. Clinton took office as secretary of state. So the foundation agreed then that it would ask the State Department to review donations from any new foreign government donors, or from existing donors that were looking to expand their giving significantly. A State Department spokesman, Mark C. Toner, said on Saturday, <U+201C>We do not have a record of a submission<U+201D> from the Clinton Foundation related to a 2012 donation from Qatar. In a hacked email from April 2012 released by WikiLeaks last week, Amitabh Desai, the Clinton Foundation<U+2019>s foreign policy director, wrote to senior foundation aides that he had recently met with ambassadors from several nations, including Qatar, while in Washington. Referring to Mr. Clinton by his initials, he wrote that Qatar <U+201C>would like to see WJC <U+2018>for five minutes<U+2019> in NYC, to present $1 million check that Qatar promised for WJC<U+2019>s birthday in 2011.<U+201D> He also said that Qatari officials <U+201C>would welcome our suggestions for investments in Haiti<U+201D> and that they have <U+201C>allocated most of their $20 million but are happy to consider projects we suggest.<U+201D> Qatar had donated to the foundation since 2002. The country, a tiny oil-rich Persian Gulf monarchy, has a complicated diplomatic relationship with the United States; it is an ally, but it has also been suspected of quietly supporting militant Islamic groups. Clinton Foundation officials said Saturday that they did not have to clear the $1 million gift with the State Department because it was not a <U+201C>material increase<U+201D> from Qatar<U+2019>s previous donation levels. The claim, however, was impossible to verify because the foundation is not required to publicly report every donation it receives and has not done so. <U+201C>Qatar has been among our hundreds of thousands of donors who have supported the Clinton Foundation<U+2019>s overall humanitarian work, including making lifesaving H.I.V./AIDS treatment available to millions of people in more than 70 countries, combating childhood obesity here in the United States and working to empower girls and women around the world,<U+201D> said Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the foundation.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Dave Hodges \n source: thecommonsenseshow.com \n text: Your Facebook Page Could Land You In a FEMA Camp \n\n\nAgainst my better judgment, I often put my articles on Facebook. Lately, Facebook has been taking down my posts, particularily on topics related to World War III. One of my readers counted 14 sites saw my articles disappear. It is too late for me, but for most of you, you should consider not participating on Facebook. It is one more intelligence gathering tool designed to separate the sheep, from the independent thinkers! \nNo matter how annoying Facebook<U+2019>s censors may be, there are real dangers associated with posting and reading on Facebook. \nFacebook<U+2019>s Friends Are Not Nice People \nFacebook is aligned with both the CIA and the NSA. I have several credible sources tell me that all data posted on Facebook goes into series of cataloged files which culminates with each person being assigned a <U+201C>Threat Matrix Score<U+201D>. The mere existence of a Threat Matrix Score should send chills up and the collective spines of every American. \nWhen, not if, martial law comes to America, this Threat Matrix Score, of which Facebook data is used to help compile an <U+201C>enemies of the state<U+201D> list, your future longevity could be seriously imperiled. It is too late for people like Steve Quayle, Doug and Joe Hagmann, John B. Wells and myself to avoid being placed on this list. However, it is not too late for the average American to limit their exposure by NOT posting and participating on Facebook. Facebook participation should come with a black box warning: \n<U+201C>WARNING: The views expressed on Facebook can and will be used against you. Participation in Facebook could prove detrimental to the length of your life. All political dissident views are immediately reported to the CIA and the NSA. Risk of repeated exposure on Facebook could result in you and your family being hauled out of their homes at 3AM, separated from your family and sent to a re-education camp<U+201D>. \nBefore you dismiss this hypothetical black box warning as too much <U+201C>tongue in cheek<U+201D>, please consider that the NSA is presently extracting large amounts of Facebook data and I do not think they are compiling a Christmas card list. Facebook<U+2019>s Welcome Is Wearing Off \nMany of us in print and broadcast media are rethinking our association with Facebook. Several of our journalistic brothers and sisters have been censored and/or otherwise treated unprofessionally by this entity. Facebook has become replete with trolls who patrol the cyber corridors of this monolithic entity chastising and censoring whoever exposes the liberal, anti-human, depopulation agenda of the New World Order. Whether it is gun control, criticism of NWO puppet Obama or anything that the alleged grandson of David Rockefeller, Mark Zuckerberg, and his people disagree with, they will kick your Facebook account to the curb for daring to express a legitimate political opinion. \nFacebook<U+2019>s Zuckerberg, The Self-Perceived Purveyor of Integrity and Morality \nMark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook emphasized three times in a single interview with David Kirkpatrick in his book, The Facebook Effect <U+201C> You have one identity, and the days of you having a different image for your work friends or co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly. Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity .<U+201D> \nWho appointed Mr. Zuckerberg to be the moral police and the judge of integrity? It sounds like Zuckerberg can take his place with Soros, Gates, Turner, et al., and the rest of the global elite who think they have the right to treat humanity as their own personal property and view the masses as a disposable commodity. Julian Assange Assessment of Facebook \nWhistle blower, Julian Assange, once stated that <U+201C>Facebook in particular is the most appalling spying machine that has ever been invented. Here we have the world<U+2019>s most comprehensive database about people, their relationships, their names, their addresses, their locations and the communications with each other, their relatives, all sitting within the United States, all accessible to US intelligence. Facebook, Google , Yahoo <U+2013> all these major US organizations have built-in interfaces for US intelligence. It<U+2019>s not a matter of serving a subpoena. They have an interface that they have developed for US intelligence to use.<U+201D> \nNever before in American cyber-history do we see such an arrogant and agenda serving entity operating their propaganda so far in the open as we do with Facebook. This propaganda end of the New World Order is being blatantly exposed. \nFacebook<U+2019>s arrogance was on full display when highly respected journalist, Jon Rappoport was banned from sharing his articles on Facebook. In this instance of blatant censorship, Jon<U+2019>s banned article was merely a review of certain aspects of American presidents ranging from Nixon to Obama. Like so many of us that understand history and can see the tyrannical path that Obama is taking us down, Rappoport identified Obama<U+2019>s unconstitutional missteps. And for daring to tell the truth, Facebook banned Rappoport for the mere expression of a legitimate political opinion. \nReaders may also recall when members of Infowars.com and the popular talk show host, Michael Rivero were banned in December of 2012, until the public outcry for Facebook to reinstate their respective accounts backed Facebook into a corner from which they acquiesced and reinstated the previously banned media figures. Rules For Thee but Not For Me \nFacebook does not apply their holier than thou attitude to their own corporate behavior. As Zuckerberg talks about rectifying Americans lack of integrity through timely Facebook exposure, Facebook fails to pay its own fair share of taxes as a result of tax loopholes and deductions. Facebook paid no income tax for the fiscal year 2012 , despite reaping $1.1 billion in U.S. corporate profits. While Americans have just been subjected to higher taxes, billion-dollar corporations like Facebook, General Electric, Boeing and Wells Fargo have all been able to avoid paying any corporate income taxes, reports the Citizens for Tax Justice .",

Prices rallied further in aftermarket trading and were recently up 1%. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it has uncovered new evidence in its investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s email server and is reviewing evidence in connection with a probe that had been previously closed. The news boosted prices for the precious metal, a popular safe haven during political or economic turbulence. <U+201C>Something like this, right before the election, definitely creates lots of uncertainty,<U+201D> said Bob Haberkorn, a broker at RJO Futures. <U+201C>This was the fresh news that gold needed.<U+201D> Gold prices reversed losses earlier in the session after a report showing the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in two years during the third quarter. On one hand, the stronger-than-expected numbers bolstered the argument for the Federal Reserve to raise rates in coming months. Gold struggles to compete with yield-bearing investments such as Treasurys when rates rise. At the same time, however, some market participants believe stronger growth may be a harbinger of rising consumer prices. Some investors buy gold on expectations that inflation will accelerate, as they believe the metal holds its value better than other assets. <U+201C>Investors have got inflation and the election on their minds,<U+201D> said Ira Epstein, a strategist at the Linn Group. While expectations of a rate increase in December will likely limit gains, <U+201C>gold doesn<U+2019>t look like it has much downside from here,<U+201D> he said. Federal-funds futures, used to bet on central-bank policy, on Friday showed that investors assigned a 73.6% likelihood of a rate increase in December, up from around 50% in the middle of last month.

The technology is named for its zero-identity function of shielding transactions on its blockchain, or digital ledger. <U+201C>Zerocash is a new protocol that provides a privacy-preserving version of Bitcoin (or a similar currency),<U+201D> its developers explain . <U+201C>[I]n Zerocash, users may pay one another directly, via payment transactions that reveal neither the origin, destination, or amount of the payment.<U+201D> The enthusiasm surrounding the coin is demonstrated in the recent price for Zerocash futures contracts, representing one unit and valued against the price of one Bitcoin (BTC). Between September 15th and October 26th the price surged almost 1,300%<U+2014>from a low of $18 (0.027 BTC) to a high of $261 (0.379 BTC). Upon its October 28 debut the price of one Zcash actually exceeded $100,000,000 (one million) on some exchanges , with an average of about around $15,000. The high valuation and scarcity is at least partly influenced by the novel way Zcash is being introduced. The cryptocurrency will not be initially available to investors for over-the-counter purchases and can only be obtained in gradually increasing increments over a month-long period through <U+201C> mining, <U+201D> or digital production by those with the necessary computer equipment and technological expertise. An additional reason for the building excitement around Zcash is that its development team consists of notable computer scientists at University of California at Berkeley, Johns Hopkins University, Tel Aviv University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology state actors, including Amazon, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Office of Naval Research, and the Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology. The entire list of funders is as follows: *Amazon.com *Tel Aviv University Authentication Initiative *Center for Science of Information (CSoI), an NSF Science and Technology Center *Check Point Institute for Information Security *U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) *Air Force Research Laboratory *European Community<U+2019>s Seventh Framework Programme *Israeli Centers of Research Excellence I-CORE program *Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology *The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust *Office of Naval Research *Simons Foundation *Skolkovo Foundation Libertarians especially, with their philosophical antipathy toward state monopoly that central banking epitomizes have been among the most vigorous supporters of cryptocurrency development and use. This is accentuated by the fact that traditional markets for <U+201C>hard money<U+201D> investment such as precious metals are likewise subject to heavy manipulation by the same or allied central banking outlets. Yet one would be hard-pressed to come up with a greater illustration of centralized state power than the array of interests listed above. Indeed, the involvement of such actors in developing the <U+201C>next Bitcoin<U+201D> should be recognized vis-a-vis the Western financial community<U+2019>s continued advocacy for the drastic reduction of conventional central bank-issued currency from circulation (i.e. here , here , here , here and here ). In theory Zerocash differs from Bitcion in that it represents a bolstered technology for anonymous transactions veiled from third party scrutiny. According to the mechanics such transactions may be viewed and recorded by the specific parties who obtains proper authorization. What if a Trojan Horse capability could be engineered into the currency that might later be utilized by lettered agencies? This is the greatest fear of those who rightly question the loss of tangible exchange. Further, such a development would defeat ZeroCash<U+2019>s desirability and purpose. By dismissing the possibility of such a feature Zcash users implicitly rely on the integrity of the developers themselves, most of whom are junior faculty or graduate students whose research, as noted, is at least partly funded by such deep state actors. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts regard cryptocurrencies as a sort of deus ex machina against the state. Along these lines, Zerocash<U+2019>s institutional and scholarly veneer cloaks the more complex grant-generating interests lurking in the shadows. Recently even strong advocates of Bitcoin have pondered if the financial medium may have been developed with direct or indirect participation of the intelligence community. In the case of Zcash there can be no doubt of such deep state interest and involvement, which is of no small concern as the world moves toward a seemingly inevitable <U+201C>cashless society.<U+201D> Submit your review",

Pollsters say a confluence of changes are making their jobs more difficult: People are changing how they communicate, moving from landlines to cellphones and the internet. That makes it harder to generate large random samples. Plus, fewer people are willing to answer surveys. As a result, pollsters must more heavily weight the answers they get, which requires making assumptions that don<U+2019>t always prove true<U+2014>especially on the variable of who will show up to vote. <U+201C>I would say, as a businessman, <U+2018>Yeah, we have to be concerned about the fact that the business I work in<U+2014>people are going to question its efficacy,<U+201D> said Fred Yang, a partner at Hart Research Associates, a Democratic polling firm in Washington. The industry<U+2019>s trade association said this week it would conduct a review of the 2016 election to better understand what happened. The outcome also raises questions about the research businesses rely on to test new products and measure customer behaviors, since many of the same survey methods are used for market research. <U+201C>A corporate market research project, you don<U+2019>t know if your polling is shit because there<U+2019>s no election day,<U+201D> Dan Wagner, head of Democratic research firm Civis Analytics, which also conducts nonpolitical surveys, said in an interview prior to the election. In politics, <U+201C>there<U+2019>s a day where you<U+2019>re going to find out whether you were right or whether you<U+2019>re an idiot.<U+201D> Two decades ago, more than one-third of U.S. households contacted for a survey agreed to answer questions, according to the Pew Research Center. Now, that number is around 9%. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s basically gotten more difficult to be accurate,<U+201D> said Patrick Ruffini, head of Republican research firm Echelon Insights. <U+201C>It doesn<U+2019>t take much for everybody to be a little bit<U+2014>or dramatically<U+2014>off about what the outcome is going to be.<U+201D> About half of all American households rely exclusively on cellphones, but reaching those people is expensive and time consuming because researchers can<U+2019>t call those people using auto-dialers. A law aimed at telemarketers requires anyone calling a cellphone to dial all 10 digits by hand. Increasing costs have pushed many researchers toward new survey methods, primarily online, that aren<U+2019>t as well understood. A study by Pew earlier this year found inaccuracies in online surveys that were hard to explain. <U+201C>When you had landlines, it was the easiest thing in the world,<U+201D> says Michigan pollster Steve Mitchell. <U+201C>Now it requires a great deal of work<U+201D> to weight the sample according to expected voter turnout. Too much weighting can introduce errors, Iowa-based pollster J. Ann Selzer says. <U+201C>The less you touch your data the better off you are,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>Every decision that you make about massaging this and weighting that, there can be attached to that a judgment call or a bias.<U+201D> For instance, Ms. Selzer says that four years ago, education level wasn<U+2019>t an important indicator for voting preference. This year it was. Most pollsters based their models on what happened in the 2012 election, which Ms. Selzer says opened the door for problems. <U+201C>The assumption that the electorate would look the same and act the same was wrongheaded from the get go.<U+201D> Mr. Wagner says people who respond to polls may be fundamentally different from those who don<U+2019>t. In this case, Mr. Wagner<U+2019>s early analysis indicates that low-educated white people who are willing to answer polls don<U+2019>t seem to reflect the opinions of the group as a whole. Mr. Mitchell, in Michigan, says his voter turnout model is what gave him trouble and it was exacerbated by the difficulty of reaching voters. Mr. Mitchell normally uses only landlines. But landlines reach far more older people than young people, so he weights their answers accordingly. Then, on the Thursday before Election Day, Mr. Mitchell began incorporating data from a new source: surveys done by people who responded to banner ads on mobile phones. Mr. Mitchell hoped the method would make it easier to reach young people. It collected more young people than Mr. Mitchell anticipated. But he neglected to weight the sample back down to his original estimates. Because more young people preferred Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Mitchell<U+2019>s poll showed that her support had increased from 3 points to 5 points. Mr. Trump leads in Michigan by 0.3%, but the Associated Press still deems the race too close to call. <U+201C>I would say the state of the craft remains challenging and challenged,<U+201D> said Mr. Yang, whose firm directs The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll with the Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies. <U+201C>But it wasn<U+2019>t just because of Tuesday. It<U+2019>s been like this for a while,<U+201D> because of the difficulties of building a sample that accurately reflects the voting public and of estimating which people will actually vote. Mr. Yang saw little evidence that any one method for building a sample<U+2014>those done by phone, those without live interviewers or those that rely on a range of data sources<U+2014>proved itself better than any other. The one exception, he said, might be a method employed by the Los Angeles Times and its partner that assembled a panel of 3,200 respondents and re-interviewed them regularly. That method was criticized during the campaign for consistently showing Mr. Trump ahead. The final estimate was that Mr. Trump would win by 3 points. But that poll wasn<U+2019>t entirely accurate, either, because it is Mrs. Clinton who is on pace to win the popular vote, by about 1 percentage point. Chris Wilson, chief executive of Wilson Perkins Allen Opinion Research, said his skepticism of polling has led his firm more deeply into data analytics<U+2014>using voter files and other databases, as well as predictive models, to get a sense of public opinion. Traditional polling <U+201C>is not going to survive,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s going to go away in its current form.<U+201D> Write to Ryan Knutson at ryan.knutson@wsj.com and Aaron Zitner at Aaron.Zitner@dowjones.com",

In a closed-door meeting of House Republicans, Mr. Ryan stepped in and stopped lawmakers from passing a change to their internal rules on Wednesday that would have allowed them to make limited funding requests for their districts, according to House GOP aides. Mr. Ryan noted that Republican Donald Trump had just won the White House last week with a pledge to <U+201C>drain the swamp,<U+201D> and that the House couldn<U+2019>t immediately turn around and bring back the practice without public debate, according to someone in the room. He pledged to debate the issue more thoroughly and let them vote on it by the end of March 2017. House Republicans had been debating a proposal from Rep. Tom Rooney (R., Fla.) that would have let lawmakers request funding only for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation projects, aides said. It was clear from comments at the meeting, aides said, that there was support for the measure from lawmakers annoyed that they had ceded some of the more granular funding decisions to the executive branch after banning earmarks in 2010 . <U+201C>There<U+2019>s a lot of pent-up frustration that we have voluntarily given our congressional authority to the executive branch,<U+201D> Rep. Mike Rogers (R., Ala.), a supporter of the new push, said Wednesday night. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s time to take that back in a responsible way.<U+201D> Mr. Rogers said he expected the proposal would be approved by House Republicans next year. But the effort sparked an immediate backlash outside the Capitol, fanned by the suspicions of conservative groups that have long called earmarks emblematic of rampant federal spending and lawmakers helping out special-interest groups. <U+201C>Earmarks have come to symbolize everything wrong with how Washington does business, and the effort by some Republican lawmakers to bring them back shows they aren<U+2019>t serious about changing a thing,<U+201D> Andy Koenig, a vice president at Freedom Partners, a conservative group affiliated with the Koch brothers, said in a statement Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who previously supported the practice, said he didn<U+2019>t think they would return in the Senate. But retiring Minority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) called himself <U+201C>one of the kings of earmarks<U+201D> Wednesday, and vigorously advocated for their return. <U+201C>It was a terrible disservice to America to come up with this stupid idea<U+2014>stupid idea<U+2014>to stop congressional-directed spending,<U+201D> Mr. Reid told reporters. <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve never apologized to anybody.

The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, rose 1% to 88.89. The index had fallen as much as 0.8% overnight, as investors reacted to the unexpected election outcome. A conciliatory victory speech by Mr. Trump and pledges by central banks to intervene in currency markets if necessary helped soothe worried investors, analysts said. <U+201C>The market has started realizing there is a positive scenario: Trump may be able to implement fiscal stimulus measures he has been talking about, said Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G-10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. <U+201C>In his speech, he focused on these policies rather than referring to trade protection.<U+201D> Stock-market investors took a similar view, lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average more than 250 points. The dollar was recently up about 1% against the euro, while it recovered from a nearly 4% loss against the Japanese yen to trade up 0.7%. Many investors had feared some of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s policy proposals, such as scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement, would damage the U.S. economy and trading partners such as Mexico. The Mexican peso, viewed by many as the currency most-vulnerable to the election outcome, remained near record lows on Wednesday. During a press conference, Mexican officials said they were watching market volatility but declined to take immediate action to stem the peso<U+2019>s decline. The dollar was recently up 8.6% to 19.86 pesos, coming off gains of roughly 13% throughout the night. Trading volume in the Mexican peso was about 63 times normal from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, when polling results from key swing states began to point to a Trump victory. According to data from CLS Group, which settles the majority of the world<U+2019>s currency transactions, overall volume during that period was nearly seven times normal. The dollar climbed 2.5% against the South Korean won, and some traders said they suspect the country<U+2019>s central bank stepped in to help tame volatility. The Bank of Korea declined to comment on whether it had intervened. The U.S. dollar also hit a historical high against the Turkish lira and the Mongolian togrog. Analysts had warned for months that investors were underprepared for the risks of a Trump presidency. Investors, bookmakers and pollsters saw Democrat Hillary Clinton as the favorite as U.S. voting wound down on Tuesday evening. When exit polls and early results showed Trump wins in key states, trades quickly reversed. <U+201C>When we came in Asia time, the market was telling us this was a done deal for Clinton,<U+201D> said Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist, at Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore. <U+201C>You<U+2019>re seeing that unravel,<U+201D> he said. Mr. Van-Petersen said all the TVs were on in his office and he was watching several websites for the latest updates on election results. Mrs. Clinton conceded the election in the early hours of Wednesday morning in New York. One of the biggest movements was in the Japanese yen, a favorite place of investors to stash cash in times of turmoil, which notched one of its biggest intraday moves since the day the U.K. voted to leave the European Union. Yen strength is seen as damaging to export-dependent Japanese corporations, whose products become less competitive abroad. The yen weakened after Japan<U+2019>s central bank and finance officials convened an emergency meeting while the government<U+2019>s chief spokesman warned it will take <U+201C>appropriate action<U+201D> if the volatility continued. Japan<U+2019>s Chief cabinet Secretary, Yasuhide Suga, said recent foreign-exchange and stock movements have been <U+201C>speculative<U+201D> and <U+201C>one-sided,<U+201D> and he warned such swings could have <U+201C>extremely negative effects on the stability of the economy and the financial system.<U+201D> <U+201C>If such movements continue, the government will take appropriate measures,<U+201D> he said. <U+2014>Suryatapa Bhattacharya and Mitsuru Obe in Tokyo and Gregor Stuart Hunter in Hong Kong contributed to this article.

The United States Geological Survey has reported that a magnitude 6.9 quake, originally reported as a level 7.3 tremor, struck near Honshu. This is on the country<U+2019>s east coast. The seismic activity was geographically located at 37.392 north latitude and 141.404 east longitude.\nThis quake was near Fukushima region and arose from about six miles deep in the earth. The closest area was the city of Namie, about 150 miles northeast of Tokyo.\nThe location of the strong earthquake that rocked Japan caused a tsunami alert to be issued. Namie lies almost directly on the Pacific coast. Initial reports about the strong earthquake that rocked Japan and caused the tsunami alert have not been accompanied by reports of casualties, although reports may be scarce. At the time of publication, no further information was available.\nEarthquakes are generalized as minor to great. Any tremor of a magnitude between 6.0 and 6.9 is considered strong and capable of doing much damage in populated areas. Despite the quake severity, scientific estimates reveal about 100 of these occurring each year throughout the world.\nThe movement of the earth can create a tsunami or tidal wave. The National Weather Service Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii issued the alert. Estimates are that waves could reach up to one meter above tide level. Uncertainties exist in providing a more accurate forecast because of local weather situations and oceanic conditions that cannot be adequately accounted for, such as reefs and atolls.\nWritten by Bob Reinhard\nEdited by Cathy Milne\nSources:\nUnited States Geological Survey: M6.9 <U+2013> Near the East Coast of Honshu, Japan (Updated)\nPacific Tsunami Warning Center, Ewa Beach HI: Tsunami Threat Message\nMichigan Tech University: Earthquake Magnitude Scale/Classes\nPhoto Courtesy of Bryan Jones<U+2019> Flickr Page <U+2013> Creative Commons License    earthquake , fukushima , Japan , tsunami",

Dixon \nWhen astute political commentary from a half century ago eloquently describes the current political conundrum it means we<U+2019>ve been stuck in a bad place for a long time. Do we really want Malcolm<U+2019>s observation to apply four or eight or twenty years further into the future? Malcolm X on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump A Black Agenda Radio Commentary by Bruce A. Dixon \nIt<U+2019>s that time again, it<U+2019>s presidential election season, and as we hear every four years, THIS is the most important presidential election of our lives. The fact that you<U+2019>ve heard that before should tell us something. It should us that in presidential years, many old things becomes new again, often because so much of what we<U+2019>re told IS new is really pretty old. \nMalcolm X has been dead now a half century, dead for more years than he was ever alive. But since at least one of the tricks and traps deployed to fool, frustrate and neutralize our grandparents<U+2019> right to vote hasn<U+2019>t changed much we might want to listen carefully to what Malcolm<U+2019>s words in the aftermath of the 1964 presidential election. \n<U+201C> If Johnson had been running all by himself, he would not have been acceptable to anyone. The only thing that made him acceptable to the world was that the shrewd capitalists, the shrewd imperialists, knew that the only way people would run toward the fox would be if you showed them a wolf. So they created a ghastly alternative. And it had the whole world <U+2014> including people who call themselves Marxists <U+2014> hoping that Johnson would beat Goldwater.<U+201D> \nLike today<U+2019>s Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater was a truly reprehensible and frightening figure, who had opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned racial discrimination in public accommodations, and who favored the use of nuclear weapons to defoliate the Vietnamese countryside. Also like Donald Trump, Goldwater never really stood a chance of winning the election. Goldwater the wolf was buried beneath a Johnson landslide, carrying only 6 out of the 50 states. Republican officeholders are running away from Donald Trump not because he<U+2019>s a racist bufoon but because he<U+2019>s expected to lose states Republicans are accustomed to winning. \nThe fox, Lyndon Baines Johnson went on to start a war in Indochina that killed three million Vietnamese alone. LBJ defoliated the Vietnamese countryside with millions of tons of Agent Orange instead of nukes, causing hundreds of thousands of hideous and gruesome birth defects that continue to this day. \nThe wolf and the fox this year are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Trump is a real estate con man, a racist and a hyper-entitled sexual predator who talks about building walls and banning Muslims. Fortunately for us all, Trump has never been in government. Hillary has scarcely ever been out of government. She<U+2019>s fronted for Wal-Mart, executed bloody regime change in Libya, brought US troops to Ukraine on the Russian border, and publicly itches for a showdown in Syria. Thanks to Wikileaks there is copious evidence that Hillary<U+2019>s public stands on a wide range of issues from charter schools to so-called trade agreements, to fracking and social security stand in stark contrast to the promises she makes to the powerful. \nJust as it worked 52 years ago, the overwhelming defeat of her wolvish opponent will give Hillary the appearance of a mandate. But the margin of Hillary<U+2019>s victory provides those of us on the left an unprecedented opportunity. It means there is no need for those who imagine themselves on the of jobs, justice, peace and the planet to ride to Hilllary<U+2019>s rescue and ensure the defeat of Donald Trump. Trump has already beaten himself. \nThis election is our best chance to break out of the decades-old two party trap and build a new political force, a new political party. The Green Party is the only peace party, the only party that stands for people and planet over profit, and our only opportunity to vote our hopes, not our fears. It<U+2019>s time to choose. \nWe vote Green and build Green, we can consign the political conundrum Malcolm X eloquently described a half century ago to the garbage can of history. Or we can vote for Hillary, and Malcolm<U+2019>s words will be as applicable four or eight years or twenty years from now as they have been for the last fifty.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Richard Rubin \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-tax-plan-would-boost-economy-in-short-run-but-not-long-term-analysis-finds-1476726625 \n text: Donald Trump <U+2019>s tax proposals would boost the economy in the short run, while Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s would slow economic growth. Those effects would reverse over the long haul, because Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plan would increase federal debt and harm the economy unless he proposed spending cuts far larger than those he has outlined, according to an analysis released Monday. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s tax proposals would reduce gross domestic product in 2018 by 0.19% below what it otherwise would be, while Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plan would make it 1.12% higher. By 2027, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s plan would increase GDP by 0.4% above baseline projections, while Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plan would make it 0.43% smaller. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s a definite tradeoff between short run and long run,<U+201D> said Kent Smetters, the economist who led the analysis. <U+201C>The numbers basically reverse sign.<U+201D> The study comes from the<U+00A0>Penn Wharton Budget Model, which is working with the<U+00A0>Tax Policy Center, a Washington project of the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute that is run by a former Treasury official from Bill Clinton <U+2019>s administration. The study is limited in that it looks only at the candidates<U+2019> tax plans, not the entirety of their fiscal programs. The website associated with the study displays detailed simulations of the candidates<U+2019> plans and lets any user adjust some of the economic assumptions. Mrs. Clinton, for example, wants to spend money on infrastructure and expanding the social safety net, so her full plan wouldn<U+2019>t reduce projected budget deficits. Mr. Trump says lighter regulations and changes to trade policy could spur economic growth and cover the costs of his tax cuts. He also says he will reduce some government agencies<U+2019> budgets, though he has also said he would increase defense spending and protect Social Security and Medicare benefits. Mr. Trump would have to cut spending in half outside of Social Security and Medicare to prevent his tax cuts from causing long-term reductions in GDP, Mr. Smetters said. Jacob Leibenluft, a policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton, said the report showed that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plan would severely harm economic growth. <U+201C>Because this analysis only takes into account the candidates<U+2019> tax plans, it doesn<U+2019>t show the truly stark differences between their economic visions,<U+201D> Mr. Leibenluft said in a statement. <U+201C>As other analyses have shown, Secretary Clinton<U+2019>s investments in areas like infrastructure, innovation and education will create good-paying jobs, whereas Donald Trump<U+2019>s harmful proposals on immigration and trade will result in a recession.<U+201D> The Trump campaign hasn<U+2019>t issued a statement on Monday<U+2019>s report. Before accounting for economic growth, Mr. Trump would reduce federal revenue by nearly<U+00A0>15% by cutting tax rates<U+00A0>on businesses and individuals. Those changes would increase the incentives to work, save and invest, and could result in growth that would yield more than 700,000 additional jobs, though those are estimates within a broad range. Mrs. Clinton would raise taxes by about 4% with a concentrated set of tax hikes on high-income households and targeted tax relief for middle-income families. Although those changes would be a drag on growth, according to the new analysis, Mrs. Clinton has been careful to pair her proposed spending increases with tax hikes to keep projected budget deficits from getting any higher. The Penn Wharton model assumes that higher budget deficits will crowd out private investment and slow the economy. <U+201C>Clinton has negative effects on incentives. Trump has positive effects on incentives,<U+201D> Mr. Smetters said. <U+201C>Eventually, the debt accumulates to take what was positive and turn it into negative within about 10 years.<U+201D> The Wharton model is different from the framework used by the conservative-leaning<U+00A0>Tax Foundation, which projects that the Trump plan would increase long-run GDP by at least 6.9% and cover some of its budgetary costs. The Clinton plan, according to the Tax Foundation, would generate about half as much tax revenue as the campaign says and would reduce long-run GDP by 2.6%. The Tax Foundation<U+2019>s model assumes an influx of foreign capital and doesn<U+2019>t consider the effect of budget deficits as a long-term drag on the economy.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: No Author \n source: lewrockwell.com \n text: American Thinker November 1, 2016 \nIs it a crisis yet? The fate of a criminal probe into the activities of a possible president has been fought behind closed doors. The nation<U+2019>s premier investigative agency allegedly is riven by conflict over investigating Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s email, the Clinton Foundation, and Anthony Weiner<U+2019>s sexting. \nDevlin Barrett of the Wall Street Journal has apparently mined many sources at the FBI and the DoJ, along with other <U+201C>people familiar with the matter,<U+201D> and put together a remarkable piece that is providing a lot of new information. Unfortunately, it is behind a paywall, though I understand that the WSJ is offering very low initial subscription rates, as low as $4, which might be worth it even on a tight budget, considering the history unfolding before our eyes. \nBarrett identifies a timeline for the Weiner email trove that begins: \n<U+2026> in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe, the bureau<U+2019>s second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor , they had recovered a laptop. Many of the 650,000 emails on the computer, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter. The FBI lacked a warrant to read the emails, but they did examine the metadata, that showed <U+201C>apparently <U+2026> thousands<U+201D> of them were from Hillary<U+2019>s private email server. \nThis led to a dramatic meeting: \nAt a meeting early last week of senior Justice Department and FBI officials, a member of the department<U+2019>s senior national-security staff asked for an update on the Weiner laptop, the people familiar with the matter said. At that point, officials realized that no one had acted to obtain a warrant, these people said. \nMr. McCabe then instructed the email investigators to talk to the Weiner investigators and see whether the laptop<U+2019>s contents could be relevant to the Clinton email probe, these people said. After the investigators spoke, the agents agreed it was potentially relevant. \nMr. Comey was given an update, decided to go forward with the case and notified Congress on Friday, with explosive results. Senior Justice Department officials had warned the FBI that telling Congress would violate policies against overt actions that could affect an election, and some within the FBI have been unhappy at Mr. Comey<U+2019>s repeated public statements on the probe, going back to his press conference on the subject in July. \nBarrett does not venture into speculation, but I believe that Comey had no choice at that point, because the news would have leaked out. Too many people knew of the discovery at this point (including, possibly, the NYPD , which may have gotten the Weiner probe going in the first place <U+2013> we still don<U+2019>t know). Many journalists (including me) in touch with active and retired FBI agents have heard of the extreme disappointment of many within the FBI community with Comey<U+2019>s damage to the Bureau<U+2019>s reputation. \nThe meatiest reporting, however, covers the investigation of the Clinton Foundation, which Barrett characterizes as one of <U+201C> several matters related, directly or indirectly, to Mrs. Clinton and her inner circle<U+201D> (emphasis added). \nNew details show that senior law-enforcement officials repeatedly voiced skepticism of the strength of the evidence in a bureau investigation of the Clinton Foundation, sought to condense what was at times a sprawling cross-country effort, and, according to some people familiar with the matter, told agents to limit their pursuit of the case. The probe of the foundation began more than a year ago to determine whether financial crimes or influence peddling occurred related to the charity. \nUnnamed FBI agents are characterized as <U+201C>viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity[.]<U+201D> My guess is that the <U+201C>senior law enforcement officials<U+201D> voicing skepticism might be from Loretta Lynch<U+2019>s staff. But they may include FBI officials.",

Bender Damian Paletta \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-transition-team-works-to-form-cabinet-1478824110 \n text: WASHINGTON<U+2014> Donald Trump <U+2019>s transition team raced to form his cabinet on Thursday as more names were floated for some of the biggest jobs in the president-elect<U+2019>s administration, including a foe of financial regulation for the powerful position of Treasury secretary. U.S. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican known for his sharp criticism of the 2010 financial regulatory overhaul, is among a growing list of potential nominees for the New York businessman<U+2019>s cabinet as speculation increased about who would surround the new president in office, people familiar with the discussions said. The transition process has ramped up in recent days, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the team is far from making final recommendations to Mr. Trump. An initial website for the transition went online<U+00A0>on Wednesday, and Mr. Trump has yet to name a chief of staff, which is typically the first announcement for a new administration. The time between Election Day and Inauguration Day in January is often turbulent as an incoming administration faces a multitude of critical decisions in a tight span. In addition, to picking his top staff, the president-elect must vet and fill a cabinet composed of 15 executive departments and a host of other aides who have cabinet rank. The incoming administration also must begin selecting about 1,000 top positions that require Senate confirmation, sketch out an agenda for the first few months of its term, write an inauguration speech and plan the ceremony. In a sign of the fluidity of the situation, senior staff is still being added to the transition team. For example, PayPal co-founder and tech billionaire Peter Thiel is under consideration to play a senior role on that team, a person familiar with the matter said.<U+00A0>The consideration of Mr. Thiel was reported by the Huffington Post. In addition to Mr. Hensarling,<U+00A0>Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.) was being discussed as a potential defense secretary or attorney general, several people familiar with the process said. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who played a prominent role in the Trump campaign, is also expected to have a place in the next administration. Mr. Giuliani has also been discussed as a possible attorney general or secretary of state, people familiar with the discussions said. Dan DiMicco, a former steel executive who has been sharply critical of U.S. trade policies, has been an influential voice on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s policy team and may find a high-profile job in the administration, two transition team members said. A potential commerce secretary is Ray Washburne, a Dallas-based investor and former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr. DiMicco told The Wall Street Journal he was running the transition team for U.S. trade, but <U+201C>nothing more at this point.<U+201D> U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, is in the running for homeland security secretary, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Hensarling<U+2019>s Texas roots could offer a contrast to other potential picks to run Treasury, particularly those with the kind of Wall Street ties about which Mr. Trump railed during the campaign.<U+00A0>Mr. Hensarling said in an interview<U+00A0>on Thursday that<U+00A0>he would <U+201C>certainly have the discussion<U+201D> if the Trump administration came calling. <U+201C>But I<U+2019>m not anticipating the telephone call,<U+201D> he added. <U+201C>It is not something I<U+2019>ve indicated interest in. It is not something I am pursuing.<U+2026>I think I<U+2019>m in a pretty good position now to advance the cause.<U+201D> Mr. Hensarling, a former congressional aide who now represents the Dallas area, is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, a panel on which he has served for more than a decade. He has pursued top GOP priorities such as rolling back the 2010 Dodd-Frank law . Vice President-elect Mike Pence, a former member of the House and Indiana governor, and Rep. Hensarling worked closely together in Congress and their views on many financial issues are closely aligned. Mr. Hensarling had backed Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) for president during the Republican primary, but he praised Mr. Trump for selecting Mr. Pence as his running mate. Mr. Hensarling has been a leading critic of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which finances American exports. The Export-Import Bank<U+2019>s charter lapsed for nearly five months last year after Mr. Hensarling led a campaign to block its reauthorization. The bank has been unable this year to back deals larger than $10 million because the Senate hasn<U+2019>t filled vacant board positions. Mr. Hensarling also sought to pass legislation in 2013 that would phase out government-controlled mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a piece of unfinished business from the 2008 financial crisis that the Trump administration is likely to inherit. <U+2014>Ryan Tracy and William Mauldin contributed to this article.

        "input": "time: null \n author: MM \n source: sgtreport.com \n text: by Bill Holter, JS Mineset : \nHere we are again, just six days away from a major COMEX gold (and silver) delivery month with a huge outsized amount of contracts outstanding versus deliverable inventory. For a background, COMEX holds 2,083,000 (nearly 65 tons) of registered gold. This amount is much higher than it was last December when it stood at a miniscule 152,000 ounces (4.7 tons). \nSince May of this year, something has drastically changed in the monthly amounts delivered. For all of 2015, only 51 tons were delivered which amounted to about 4.25 tons per month. If you recall, many months would arrive at first notice day with a huge amount of contracts open, only to see the contracts evaporate before the close of the delivery period. I postulated then and still believe, contract holders were offered premiums to <U+201C>just go away<U+201D> and not take delivery. I cannot prove this but you must ask, why someone would FULLY FUND their account to take delivery and then not follow through. It makes no sense other than if they were enticed not to take delivery after placing the full amount of funds in their accounts to settle delivery. \nSo far this year, 191 tons have stood for delivery, 168 of those tons since May. The average delivery since May has been over 24 tons per month with only two of the seven months being a traditional delivery month. June and August amounted to nearly 93 tons alone. The change since May has been astonishing. Rather than contracts being <U+201C>bled down<U+201D> each month (enticed by premiums offered?), nearly every single month has had more standing by the end of the month than were at the beginning of the month (nearly double in some cases). Another big change is, previously, the bulk of deliveries would be withheld until just before the end of the delivery period. Now, massive deliveries are being made on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th delivery days of the month. Please remember, it makes no sense to <U+201C>wait<U+201D> to make a delivery as storage fees add up for each day <U+2026>it seems to me that it is now known that many contract owners cannot be enticed with premiums! \nSo why has this begun to happen, why are more contracts demanding delivery and why are they jumping queue and opening more contracts during expiration? I believe it is simply because there is either a greater <U+201C>need or desire<U+201D> for gold. If I had to guess, I believe the new and different demand is in large part a function of the Shanghai Gold Exchange opening in September. Immediately after opening, we saw close to $4 premiums for gold (versus COMEX and LBMA pricing) and around .50 cent premiums for silver. These premiums are now recently much higher! For the last few weeks these premiums have grown to the $10-$12 range for gold and over $1 for silver. The premiums shot up on Monday to $20.33 for gold and $1.35 for silver. This is obviously more than generous enough to allow massive arbitrage to occur. \nAs a side note, I have been asked why we are not seeing arbitrage en masse? Simply put, I believe there is a great risk here where you sell something for delivery without knowing positively you will be delivered on the buy side. Should the game end, an arbitrager might be contracted to deliver something (sell side) they cannot attain in a runaway upside market (because of the failure to deliver on the buy side). Curious that these large premiums exist as they should never exist <U+2026>unless the players do see risk in a supposedly risk free trade! The premiums are now getting to large to ignore and look more like the elephant in the room. \nSo where are we now for December expiration? Currently with only six trading days left before FND (first notice day), 217,000 contracts representing 21.7 million ounces versus 2.08 million registered to deliver. At the very same day last year, there were only 133,000 contracts outstanding or a difference of 84,000 contracts (8.4 million ounces). \nWhile we certainly cannot say the COMEX will default and not be able to deliver for December, we can say the numbers are much larger <U+2026>AND so is the pressure (via arbitrage)! To again put this in perspective for you, the entire registered category holds well less than $2.5 billion worth of gold. I would ask you this, <U+201C>how many $2.5 billion events have occurred<U+201D>? The answer of course is too many to count and they happen every single day in many markets, and all over the world. The spread in silver is getting close to a 10% number, how long will the spread be allowed? The problem of course is this, when the arbs do come in to close the gap it will create buying. The buying will require delivery as the sell side in Shanghai will demand metal for their purchase. This poses the problem, COMEX inventories cannot meet Chinese demand. \nTo finish, please keep in mind that the global credit markets are now experiencing extreme liquidity tightness. Previous <U+201C>credit events<U+201D> were ugly and all ended the same way <U+2026>with more debt and more currency units issued. As we have seen in India, as gold has not been available since their recent kamikaze currency move, gold was changing hands at $2,900 per ounce on Friday and $3,600 over the weekend due to lack of supply. Ask yourself, at what dollar price will gold be available should someone (or collectively) put up $2.5 billion to clean out COMEX? Yes I know, COMEX is not the only market in the world. But a run on COMEX will be a run everywhere and will result in finding available gold nowhere. A <U+201C>run<U+201D> can start for any number of reasons. It can be <U+201C>intentional<U+201D> or not. The problem from a visual standpoint is this, the amount of physical gold behind the paper gold edifice is like a <U+201C>BB<U+201D> in relation to the financial Earth. If you don<U+2019>t believe the global debt can ever be paid back in current currency values <U+2026>dig into this one as it<U+2019>s even more lopsided, paper gold can never be delivered by the real thing as the real gold simply does not exist! \nThat will do it for this holiday week as I plan to take a little time off. Unless something really big breaks, Jim and I do not plan on our weekly interview and will resume next week. We wish you and your families a Happy Thanksgiving!",

Not the American people, of course, but none other than billionaire left-wing globalist George Soros. \nSoros has donated around $25 million to the Clinton campaign as of July, according to Politico , and that clearly buys a great deal of influence. WikiLeaks has recently released emails from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta that show the lengths the campaign went to keep Soros <U+201C>happy<U+201D> and the huge amount of influence he exerted. \nIn an Oct. 7, 2014 email from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin to now-campaign manager Robby Mook, Abedin discussed a dinner Clinton was going to have with Soros. Abedin said in the email that she expected that Soros would eventually ask Clinton to attend a fundraiser for one of the numerous groups Soros helps bankroll, the liberal America Votes organization. \nMook replied to the email: <U+201C>I would only do this for political reasons (ie to make Soros happy).<U+201D> \nFox News reported : \nDuring her time as secretary of state, Clinton was forwarded from Soros<U+2019> aides on Jan. 23, 2011 a message he wrote specifically for her addressing <U+201C>a serious situation<U+201D> in Albania. Soros even included two actions that <U+201C>need to be done urgently.<U+201D> One of the suggestions was appointing <U+201C>a mediator such as Carl Bildt, Martti Ahtisaari or Miroslav Lajcak<U+2026><U+201D> \nClinton received the email the next day. On Jan. 27, Lajcak met Albanian leaders for a mediation effort. \nIn another instance, just hours after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13, 2016, Chris Stone, president of the Soros-founded Open Society Foundations, emailed Podesta and asked: <U+201C>Remember our discussion of Wallace Jefferson, [former] Chief Justice in Texas?<U+201D> Podesta simply replied, <U+201C>yup.<U+201D> \nAn adviser and spokesman for Soros, Michael Vachon, did most of the corresponding with Podesta related to Soros. Vachon scheduled phone calls and meetings along with making sure that the campaign knew Soros<U+2019> position on a variety of policy issues. \nFox News reported: \nOn March 7, 2016, Vachon sent Podesta a memo regarding <U+201C>TPP and Malaysia<U+2019>s Corruption Crisis.<U+201D> The document criticized President Obama for making <U+201C>visible compromises<U+201D> in his quest to get a deal for the Trans Pacific Partnership completed. Podesta was ostensibly set to discuss the memo with Soros and his son, Alexander, during a dinner later that month. Six days later, Vachon got even more specific. \n<U+201C>In general I think George is more interested in talking about policy than the campaign per se,<U+201D> Vachon wrote. <U+201C>In a separate email I will send you George<U+2019>s latest thinking on the migration crisis, which he is spending a lot of time on. His other big preoccupation these days is Ukraine.<U+201D> \nRefugees/migration, the Supreme Court, global warming, Ukraine, etc., are surely just a sampling of policy issues on which the globalist Soros has and will continue to influence Clinton. \nClinton is dangerous enough as it is, but as the man who could be directing policy decisions if Clinton is elected president? That is a scary thought.",

So what did she do about it? She took their money, and sent them arms. Mainstream media won't touch this with a 10-foot pole. Posted on October 27, 2016 by administrator in News , US // 0 Comments \nWikiLeaks have released an email in which Hillary Clinton admits that Qatar and Saudi Arabia <U+2013> two of her mega-donors <U+2013> provide financial and logistical support to ISIS. \nIn the extraordinary email , sent to John Podesta in 2014, Clinton lays out an eight point plan to defeat ISIS in Iraq, and mentions that Saudi Arabia and Qatar are both giving financial and logistical support to the Islamic State and other extremist Sunni groups. \nShe conveniently fails to mention that these two terror-funding states are both mega-donors to the Clinton Foundation. Qatar has given between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation and Saudi Arabia has donated upwards of $25 million dollars to the Foundation. \nNowhere in the email <U+2013> sent, of course, through the notorious unsecured server <U+2013> does Clinton address the staggering hypocrisy of continuing to provide Saudi Arabia with multiple billions in weapons, arms, aircraft, and other support in full knowledge of its active support for terrorists. \nHillary Clinton has known since at least 2014 that the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar provide <U+201C> clandestine financial and logistic support <U+201D> to ISIS and other radical Islamic groups <U+2013> but, rather than refuse their money and call for a halt of arms sales and support, she has campaigned for more money and tried to increase their supply of arms. \nArming ISIS \nIn an email revealed in the Intercept earlier this year, Jake Sullivan, then Clinton<U+2019>s deputy chief of staff, celebrated the sale to Saudi Arabia of more than 80 Boeing F-15SA fighter jets <U+2013> <U+201C> along with upgrades to the pre-existing Saudi fleet of 70 F-15 aircraft and munitions, spare parts, training, maintenance, and logistics <U+201D> <U+2013> with the heading addressed to Clinton, <U+201C> FYI <U+2014> good news .<U+201D> \nGood news <U+2013> at least for Clinton, Saudi Arabia, and ISIS. And evidence of the cozy love-in doesn<U+2019>t stop there. Ever wonder what a Clinton administration<U+2019>s top priorities will be? Jobs? Healthcare? Education? More like arming ISIS. A top Clinton aide described a $60 billion weapons transfer of fighter jets and helicopters to Saudi Arabia as a <U+201C> top priority .<U+201D> \nSaudi Arabia is the largest customer of U.S. military sales in the world with <U+201C> active and open cases valued at approximately $97 billion ,<U+201D> according to a White House fact sheet that championed the U.S.<U+2019> strong relationship with the terror-sponsoring state. \nMedia blackout \nEven in a period of America<U+2019>s history in which mainstream media repeats what one of the most powerful political dynasties in the country keeps on repeating to exhaustion <U+2013> accusing Russia of <U+201C>rigging<U+201D> the U.S. election without offering any proof to back their claims <U+2013> it is still astonishing that major outlets are refusing to report on this story. \nIs it that Qatar<U+2019>s and Saudi Arabia<U+2019>s funding of ISIS <U+2013> while funding their favorite American candidate at the same time <U+2013> is a difficult issue to report on? Or is the gutless and hopelessly biased media<U+2019>s refusal to cover this topic rooted in fear that thoroughly addressing it will cause her to lose the presidential election? \nThe press have given Clinton a free ride in this campaign. By failing to live up to their duties in a functioning democracy, the fourth estate have played their part in erecting a demon. Unencumbered by the law, unscrutinized by the media, Clinton will wield a dictator<U+2019>s authority.",

The GOP<U+2019>s alliance will be uneasy from the start, however, given congressional Republican leaders<U+2019> deep differences with Mr. Trump, whose policy stances and contentious comments they criticized during the long and turbulent presidential campaign. Both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) congratulated Mr. Trump on his victory early Wednesday morning. <U+201C>We are eager to work hand-in-hand with the new administration to advance an agenda to improve the lives of the American people,<U+201D> Mr. Ryan said in prepared remarks. Republicans in both the Senate and the House will be sworn in January with narrower margins than they had this year, even though Republican candidates in both chambers performed better than expected. Across the map, Republican incumbents in tough races were able to hang on against some carefully chosen Democratic challengers. As of about 3 a.m. Wednesday, Republicans had lost only Illinois , where Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth defeated incumbent Sen. Mark Kirk. The New Hampshire race, where Gov. Maggie Hassan posed a stiff challenge to Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte, remained too close to call well into the morning. Two former senators, Evan Bayh in Indiana and Russ Feingold in Wisconsin, weren't able to leverage their statewide name recognition to win seats in those states. Rep. Todd Young won in Indiana and incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin was re-elected with 51% of the vote to Mr. Feingold<U+2019>s 46%, with 99% of precincts counted. After months of fretting that Mr. Trump would weigh down incumbent Senate Republicans, his strength instead buoyed GOP lawmakers in battleground states. With no wave of support materializing for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to bolster down-ballot candidates, Republicans swept through swing states, including many that President Barack Obama had won four years earlier. With the victory of Sen. Johnson of Wisconsin, whose re-election had been dismissed as a long shot until the election<U+2019>s final weeks, Democrats<U+2019> chances of seizing the Senate majority dwindled to a remote possibility. GOP Sen. Pat Toomey<U+2019>s win in Pennsylvania over Democrat Katie McGinty early Wednesday morning made it impossible. Republicans will hold at least 52 seats in the Senate next year, assuming that Republican John Kennedy wins the Louisiana runoff in December, as expected. Democrats needed to win a net of five seats to recapture the Senate majority they lost in 2014. Republicans<U+2019> control of Capitol Hill will have dramatic legislative repercussions with Mr. Trump in the White House, positioning them to carry through on their pledges to repeal the 2010 health-care law and dismantle the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. Full GOP control of both chambers of Congress and the White House will leave Republicans with the political responsibility of any legislation they enact, a burden they have avoided while Mr. Obama was in office. The last time the Republicans held the White House and both chambers of Congress was from 2003 through 2007, when George W. Bush was president. The Senate also will be under pressure to confirm Mr. Trump<U+2019>s nominees to the Supreme Court, which has had a vacancy since Justice Antonin Scalia died in February. Senate Democrats, who have lambasted Republicans all year for refusing to consider Merrick Garland, Mr. Obama<U+2019>s nominee to the high court, will have to decide whether to try to stymie Mr. Trump<U+2019>s picks. That could leave Republicans considering whether to change the chamber<U+2019>s rules to allow Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed with just a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes currently required for high court nominees. Still, Republicans came short of winning the 60 seats most bills need to clear the Senate, forcing Democrats and Republicans to work together next year against the backdrop of a polarizing president and intraparty tensions. Congressional Republicans, led by Messrs. Ryan and McConnell, will have to navigate an uncertain relationship with Mr. Trump, an unpredictable and untested politician. GOP leaders repeatedly broke with Mr. Trump over the past several months. Mr. Ryan said in early October that he would no longer defend the GOP nominee after a 2005 video surfaced showing him talking in crude sexual terms about grabbing women without their consent, though Mr. Ryan later said he voted for Mr. Trump. Messrs. McConnell and Ryan criticized Mr. Trump this year for his proposals to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his comments about women, among others. And the GOP congressional leaders have pushed to overhaul federal safety-net programs that Mr. Trump has expressed no interest in slimming down. Republicans began the election cycle as underdogs, forced to defend 24 seats, compared with just 10 for Democrats. But Mr. Trump never became the drag Republicans had feared would cripple their chances in swing states. GOP gains accumulated steadily Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning, as incumbent Republicans stacked up wins in states that tipped in favor of Mr. Trump. Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio easily beat back former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, while in Florida, Sen. Marco Rubio won re-election after losing the GOP presidential primary earlier this year. Three races seen as tossups were won by Republicans, as GOP Sen. Richard Burr beat Democrat Deborah Ross in North Carolina, GOP Sen. Roy Blunt defeated Democrat Jason Kander in Missouri and Mr. Young won Indiana<U+2019>s open Senate seat to replace retiring GOP Sen. Dan Coats. Democrats held the Senate seat in Nevada being vacated by retiring Minority Leader Harry Reid, with Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto beating GOP Rep. Joe Heck. GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona, once worried that Mr. Trump could cost him re-election, easily defeated Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick to win a sixth Senate term. Earlier in the week, Democrats said they would need to work with Republicans in a chamber that runs on bipartisan cooperation. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s almost a moral imperative to get things done and break through the gridlock,<U+201D> Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, who is expected to replace Mr. Reid as minority leader, said in an interview this week. <U+201C>If gridlock persists, then the sourness, the anger, the disillusionment of the American people will grow.<U+201D> <U+2014>Arian Campo-Flores contributed to this article.

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: truthdig.com \n text: Starstruck and Party-Fanatic: The Moral Paradox of Trump Support Posted on Oct 28, 2016 \nBy Juan Cole / Informed Comment \nDonald J. Trump<U+2019>s poll numbers in California have cratered down to 28% . If he actually does that poorly in the election, he will set a record for poor performance of a presidential candidate in California. Ever. \nWhat is difficult to explain is why he isn<U+2019>t doing that poorly everywhere. Let<U+2019>s just review what Trump says he stands for: \n* Manhandling of women without their consent * Torture * Suggested that crime in Baltimore spiked because we have an African-American president * Jail time for women who have an abortion. * Reducing taxes paid by billionaires. * Stigmatizing Latinos as rapists and felons * Revival of the Ku Klux Klan without the sheets * Carpet-bombing civilian cities to get at ISIL * Unconstitutional treatment of US citizens of Muslim faith * Passage of political libel laws as a means to censor the press \nMost Americans are opposed to these planks of the Trump platform. So why is he still winning any states in the polls? \nI think there are two things going on here that give Trump a floor in many states that he does not have in California. Those two things are his celebrity status and blind party loyalty. \nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \nTrump is a celebrity of a sort we have never had run for president. Ronald Reagan, a B actor in his youth, was not in the same category. When Reagan ran for president in 1980 his acting days were long behind him and few people in the electorate cared about his old black and white films. Trump, in contrast, was on a popular reality show for 11 seasons and until just before he announced his run. Early in its run, the Apprentice got as many as 20 million viewers. It is true that the audience rapidly dropped thereafter, but nevertheless Trump was before millions of people a week. \nMost politicians have to spend time introducing themselves to the public. Most everybody knew who Trump was. I have a strong suspicion that this name recognition has inflated Trump<U+2019>s poll numbers in the generals. That is, there are a lot of Americans who don<U+2019>t follow politics. 42% of them don<U+2019>t bother to vote in a typical presidential election. Many of the rest aren<U+2019>t paying much attention until September and October just before Election Day. So in most years when pollsters call in August and ask people who they are voting for and name the two candidates, I think they probably get a lot of suspicious answers because some proportion of their sample has never heard of that person or can<U+2019>t describe what the candidate stands for. \nNot so in the case of Donald Trump. (Hillary Clinton, of course, also probably has high name recognition, but she hasn<U+2019>t been in people<U+2019>s living rooms the way Trump has. And no, I don<U+2019>t mean it that way.) \nMoreover, Americans are often forgiving of their celebrities<U+2019> foibles. Celebrities are there to entertain us or offer us power fantasies, not to behave themselves. Los Angeles prosecutors notoriously have an uphill battle in getting jurors to convict even obviously guilty celebrities. Whereas Americans at least always used to be puritanical in their expectations of politicians, they are tolerant of moral lapses in the Hollywood set. Trump confuses many of them because he is both a celebrity and a politician, but many are more willing to be lenient with him than they likely would be with some lawyer they<U+2019>d never heard of who was running for office. \nThe other distorting variable here is party loyalty. Perhaps the rise of social media has cemented party polarization in the US. There were people in the old days who voted Clinton and then voted Bush (white Protestant women did so in droves). But party loyalty seems to have solidified with the rise of social media. Maybe it is embarrassing to switch sides in public when you<U+2019>ve been involved in Twitter or Facebook slamming matches on behalf of the last party you voted for. \nA lot of Republicans are clearly clinging to Trump despite the Billy Bush tape and subsequent charges from the women he<U+2019>s groped. These include evangelicals and <U+2018>blue hairs<U+2019> (the little old white ladies who are reliably Republican and usually morally censorious). Some 82% of self-identified Republican women are still supporting Trump, groping and all. \nSo why is California different here? Well, in part it just no longer has many Republicans. About half of the some 40 million Californians are registered to vote. About 28.9 % of those registered voters are Republicans. So the party-loyalty distorting factor may still be at work there. But the GOP in California long ago tied itself to the declining white population (now a minority) and so suffered an implosion. National GOP policy and certainly that of Trump is making the same mistake, which is why they can<U+2019>t win national presidential elections any more. \nSecond, Trump has lost many women independents , those famous <U+2018>soccer moms<U+2019> who voted for Bill Clinton and then switched to W. \nSo we should expect Trump everywhere to be getting about the same percentage support as the percentage of registered voters who are Republicans. Hence, he wins in Alabama. And he might even do a little better than that, gaining those independents (especially men) willing to wink at a celebrity<U+2019>s hi jinx if only he will get the Federal government off their backs and halt immigration. \nI usually don<U+2019>t hold people<U+2019>s votes against them on moral grounds. People make their own judgments in politics and there are good people in both parties. \nBut I think there is a moral deficit in anyone still willing to vote for Trump, despite all the racism, fascism, sexism, and sexual predation. If our two-party system and our current modes of communication have led us to this place, it is time to rethink them. Otherwise the Republic is in danger. TAGS:",

The third-quarter rebound was led by the U.S. and Japan, while the U.K. and Germany slowed. Among members of the Group of Seven largest developed economies, the U.S. fared best, despite some uncertainty ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential elections. The OECD said the combined gross domestic products of its 34 members<U+2014>most of which are developed economies<U+2014>grew by 0.6% from the previous three-month period, compared with just 0.3% in the second quarter. That marked the fastest rate of quarter-to-quarter growth since the first three months of 2015. Compared with the same quarter of 2015, GDP was up 1.7%, with the U.K. growing most rapidly among G-7members, and Japan most slowly. Before the release of the third-quarter figures, the OECD had forecast that GDP in its members will rise by 1.8% in 2016, down from the 2.1% rate of expansion recorded in 2015. For 2017, the OECD and other international bodies expect a modest acceleration in global economic growth, supported by a revival in large developing economies such as Brazil and Russia that have contracted over recent years. But much will depend on the economic policies adopted by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Investors are anticipating a pickup in U.S. economic growth aided by increased spending on infrastructure projects and tax cuts. But during his campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to introduce new, higher tariffs on imports from China and Mexico , and reassess other trade relationships that he said placed U.S. workers at a disadvantage. If implemented, those measures would likely hurt growth in other parts of the world. Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Declan Walsh \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/world/americas/a-reporter-retraces-his-steps-through-trump-country.html?_r=0 \n text: From the start, the central enigma was Donald J. Trump . How did this loose-lipped celebrity tycoon with no political experience get so far? Who were the Americans supporting him and why? When I started my unusual assignment of covering the American presidential campaign from the perspective of a foreign correspondent <U+2014> for this, an American news organization <U+2014> one of the first things I did was to invite questions from international readers. The bulk of them revolved around Mr. Trump, whose unorthodox romp through the Republican primaries propelled him to the party<U+2019>s nomination <U+2014> and ultimately to the presidency. Going back through my monthslong journey across America, there were many clues to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s rising tide, although not all were easy to read. I drank with Trump supporters in bars and casinos. I approached them at rodeos. I chatted with them at gun clubs and diners and roaring political rallies. The broad topography of Trump country is, in many respects, easy to trace. It is a place of anger and frustration, gripped by a feverish anti-establishment sentiment. People wanted change <U+2014> and a chance to raise a throbbing finger to the forces they blame for their lot in life. Yet other factors were at play, too, in this unruly insurgency, factors that sometimes made it hard to see clearly: racism, xenophobia, bigotry, talk radio, social media bubbles and a simmering culture war separating thriving coastal areas and the wounded interior of the country. It wasn<U+2019>t always clear which elements were powering the <U+201C>Trump Train,<U+201D> as the movement called itself, and which were being buoyed along. One of my first stops was Williamson , a decimated coal town in West Virginia. It had a sports bar, which offered beer for $1 on Thursdays, and a biker bar where, it was said, patrons sometimes squealed tires inside until the room filled with smoke. Both were filled with Trump voters, little surprise since he had promised to reopen coal mines shuttered by the Obama administration<U+2019>s environmental regulations and cheap natural gas. In Williamson, I also saw how Mr. Trump<U+2019>s message about change was overshadowing other issues that many analysts thought would have disqualified him from winning over the social conservatives who have long been a core Republican constituency. In conversations after church on Sunday, many Christians glossed over the candidate<U+2019>s three marriages and boasts of his battle with sexually transmitted disease. (<U+201C>It<U+2019>s scary, like Vietnam,<U+201D> Mr. Trump told Howard Stern in 1997.) It was hard to square, but perhaps that was the lesson: that a mysterious alchemy was at work in this election, one in which outrageous rule-breaking might offer a route to success. Around that time, Apple released its seventh iteration of the iPhone, that glossy black totem of progress. Inscribed on the back of every iPhone are the words <U+201C>Designed in California. Assembled in China.<U+201D> As if California is a separate country. And that<U+2019>s how many in Trump country saw it <U+2014> that instead of being part of the iPhone economy, they were living in a land that sent jobs overseas. One thing that I, like many Europeans and other foreigners, had long seen as distinguishing the United States was its restless optimism and innate self-belief. Mr. Trump, though, traded on pessimism. His slogan, <U+201C>Make America Great Again,<U+201D> embodied a nativist vision that aimed to restore pride in the country<U+2019>s military and business, but also scapegoated immigrants, minorities and Muslims. At Mr. Trump<U+2019>s rallies, most of the faces in the crowd were white. People flew Confederate flags. They spoke impatiently about <U+201C>the blacks.<U+201D> Broad-brush prejudice toward Muslims was openly expressed: Danny Popma, a factory owner in Michigan, told me that children in Dearborn, which has the country<U+2019>s largest percentage of Muslims, had stayed home from school in droves on Sept. 11 because they had secretly received advanced warnings of the attacks. The atmosphere at Trump rallies was permissive. If someone said something offensive or loutish, there was little fear of being hushed or contradicted. Yet in another confounding twist, a significant minority of Trump supporters were minorities themselves. I met people who defied neat categorization: a black woman in her 20s who worked at a record label in Miami; a Japanese Uber driver in Las Vegas; a Guyanese doorman in Queens, N.Y. At a rally in the campaign<U+2019>s final week in Michigan, a Rust Belt state that would prove central to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory, I saw how the candidate connected with crowd. When he spoke, it was if he held an invisible tuning fork held to his ear, listening for the smallest murmur of applause, which he would seize upon and amplify. It reminded me of powerful preachers and populist politicians I<U+2019>d seen during my years based in Pakistan. What was hard to know was how far the electric energy inside this hall was radiating. Maybe these were just the hard-core loyalists. State-by-state polls suggested that Mr. Trump was behind in many places critical to Electoral College victory. Political professionals, including Republicans, dismissed the notion that Mr. Trump could win mainly by consolidating the support of white voters. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s like the hunt for the lost tribes of the Amazon,<U+201D> was how Stuart Stevens, a consultant who had worked for the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, put it early on. <U+201C>If you paddle your canoe far enough up the river, and bang your drum hard enough, they will come to the riverbank. But they<U+2019>re just not there.<U+201D> But when I mentioned the polls showing Mr. Trump lagging to his supporters, they snorted derisively. Everyone they knew was voting Trump <U+2014> colleagues, relatives, children. Some were former Democrats. Others were people who hadn<U+2019>t voted for decades. The polls, they said, were either asking the wrong questions or were being manipulated by the news media <U+2014> the polls themselves were part of the system these people were trying to overthrow. At the time, I discounted the conspiratorial talk as a product of the Facebook echo chamber that became so powerful in this election. But in broad terms, the Trump supporters were right <U+2014> in key states, their votes were undercounted by pollsters. The winning margin in many states, like Michigan, was tight, and the failure of Democrats to mobilize turnout was also a major factor. Daryl, the Uber driver who took me from a Trump rally to the airport, was a case in point: he was an African-American, a registered Democrat, and he did not intend to vote. <U+201C>None of them look any good to me,<U+201D> he said. Mr. Trump, then, benefited also from the antipathy so many people felt toward his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This was another theme in the questions that poured in from international readers: Why did so many Americans seem to hate her so much? The answer had many dimensions: Fatigue from her decades in public life, unfinished business from her husband<U+2019>s time in power in the 1990s, distaste for how she had handled his sexual escapades, outrage over her use of a private email server while secretary of state and her taking in huge sums for speeches to Wall Street bankers, unfiltered sexism. And Mrs. Clinton simply did not represent change at a moment when a large portion of the electorate hungered for it. In San Francisco, while I was visiting my brother, one of his friends offered an explanation. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s like getting socks for Christmas <U+2014> again <U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Socks, socks, bloody socks. Nobody wants a present like that.<U+201D> Mr. Trump, in the end, found the <U+201C>lost tribe<U+201D> of white voters. They heard his drumbeat, and voted as a bloc like never before. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s stunning victory echoes jolting changes in Britain, France and other countries where a new brand of right-wing politics is resurgent. The question of whether it stemmed from a specific constellation of forces, or represented a more fundamental shift, may now be answered under the Trump presidency.",

The comments came shortly after The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Giuliani is one of the leading candidates to become Mr. Trump<U+2019>s first secretary of state . During an appearance<U+00A0>Monday<U+00A0>evening at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council gathering, Mr. Giuliani suggested several times that he would be interested in the post, going into great detail about how he views foreign policy and how his views overlap with Mr. Trump<U+2019>s. <U+201C>ISIS, short-term I believe, is the greatest danger and not because ISIS is in Iraq and in Syria, but because ISIS did something al Qaeda never did<U+2014>ISIS was able to spread itself around the world,<U+201D> he said. Mr. Giuliani didn<U+2019>t say, however, what specifically the Trump administration would do to combat Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to keep this strategy secret so that the terror network can<U+2019>t prepare for it. Mr. Giuliani also said that the Trump administration would work to reset relations with both Russia and China. He said the Obama administration had made Russia into an adversary and said Russian President Vladimir Putin didn't respect President Barack Obama. Messrs. Trump and Putin spoke on the telephone on Monday and pledged to work together on a number of issues. The Obama administration does have a complicated relationship with Mr. Putin, and they have been at odds for several years over the Syrian civil war. The White House tried to reset relations with Russia several years ago, but Russia<U+2019>s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its support for rebels in Eastern Ukraine has pushed the U.S. and Russia further apart. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to work more cooperatively with Mr. Putin, but Mr. Giuliani gave a slightly more confrontational view of how that relationship could develop. <U+201C>Russia thinks it<U+2019>s a military competitor, it really isn<U+2019>t,<U+201D> Mr. Giuliani said. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s our unwillingness under Obama to even threaten the use of our military that makes Russia so powerful.<U+201D> On China, Mr. Giuliani said the Trump administration would prefer to engage with that country on economic issues such as trade. Mr. Trump plans to label China a <U+201C>currency manipulator<U+201D> shortly after taking office, a move that will likely escalate tensions between both countries, economic analysts have speculated. In the Middle East, Mr. Giuliani painted a picture of a collection of countries that are at odds with each other and on the brink of spilling into a broader regional war. He said that Iran had exerted its control over Iraq and Syria, though he didn<U+2019>t offer specifics on how Mr. Trump would work to address ongoing problems in the region. On Iraq, Mr. Trump has said the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 was one of the greatest foreign policy mistakes in U.S. history, but Mr. Giuliani had a different take. <U+201C>I think the way we exited Iraq was the worst decision made in American history,<U+201D> he said, saying it allowed Islamic State to flourish in the vacuum that was created. This is a common criticism from Republicans of the White House<U+2019>s foreign policy. Mr. Giuliani is well known for his tenure as New York mayor, his work as a federal prosecutor and issues like counterterrorism and homeland security. He is less well-known for his foreign-policy views. Write to Damian Paletta at damian.paletta@wsj.com",

This would restore the Senate<U+2019>s constitutional role in treaty-making and force Democrats, including Sen. Chuck Schumer, to go on record. When the vote fails, President Trump can withdraw with broad and bipartisan Senate backing. Separately, Iran<U+2019>s serial violations warrant the onerous <U+201C>snapback<U+201D> sanctions that President Obama famously and deceitfully claimed would ensue. Congress can impose new sanctions, and countries around the world can be put on notice that they can trade with Iran or with the U.S., but not both. If a nuclear Iran is truly among the most dangerous threats globally, and if we mean to take all nonmilitary measures to prevent it, there should be no qualms about this tough approach. Our security demands it. Jonathan Rothenberg Scarsdale, N.Y. Your editorial makes the classic mistake that has plagued the Democratic Party for years. You take note of the pervasive Iranian failure to honor critical provisions of President Obama<U+2019>s Iranian nuclear deal, and then you suggest that, along with enhanced monitoring, we <U+201C>honor the deal<U+201D> and <U+201C>resume enforcement of current U.S. sanctions on Iran.<U+201D> If you really believe that well-meaning policies resulting in unintended adverse consequences are a good idea, we need to look no further than North Korea to reflect on the negligible results of U.S. sanctions. Instead of encouraging policies that have repeatedly failed, shouldn<U+2019>t President-elect Trump initiate new pathways which have a higher chance of success in preventing the Iranians from ever developing nuclear weapons? This potential for a fresh perspective is one of the prime reasons Donald Trump was elected<U+2014>America will never be <U+201C>great again<U+201D> if Iran begins to threaten its neighbors and the world with a nuclear Armageddon. The recycling of failing policies from the past isn<U+2019>t the answer. Roger C. Dunham Santa Barbara, Calif. You mention aspects of the Iranian nuclear deal that, due to President Obama<U+2019>s penchant for secrecy, the American public knows nothing about. One of them is the <U+201C>economic snapback<U+201D> of sanctions in the event of any Iranian violations. Mr. Obama has always presented that option as all inclusive, when in reality it appears that the agreement calls for previous sanctions to apply only to any new contracts scheduled to begin after the verification of any Iranian violations. That is far different from the impression the Obama administration has tried to convey. Any contracts in place before the violations would be unaffected. There is no way the European nations involved in the nuclear agreement would ever cooperate to allow an interruption of the flow of money now coming to them from Iranian business contacts.

U.S. equity prices have been supported for the past three decades by an acceleration of global trade and a freer flow of capital. Those factors lifted economic growth and allowed companies to take advantage of new markets and economies of scale. The S&P 500 is up nearly ninefold since October 1986, according to FactSet. But now there is worry that the party is ending. <U+201C>We believe globalization has probably reached its peak,<U+201D> said Marino Valensise, head of the multiasset team at Barings, a member of the MassMutual Financial Group with $275 billion in assets under management. <U+201C>The market won<U+2019>t like it.<U+201D> Barings<U+2019>s senior managers every winter gather at their central London office to iron out their 10-year investment forecast. At the next one, they expect to consider reducing<U+2014>or even outright eliminating<U+2014>their estimate of the value globalization adds to stocks, what they term a <U+201C>globalization premium.<U+201D> The Barings managers say the slowdown in global trade is one factor leading them to move away from stocks that have benefited most from globalization and into places like bonds, which are in some cases better valued than the U.S. stock market and may suffer less amid rising geopolitical tensions. Other investors favor switching from multinational companies to national champions like Chinese internet companies or Latin American airlines. Global trade this year will grow at the slowest pace since 2007, according to the World Trade Organization, just as protectionist policies are on the rise and efforts to liberalize trade have stalled. The International Monetary Fund recently warned that anti-trade trends such as increases in tariffs could cause long-term damage to the world economy. Some are worried this could spill over to corporate profits. Global stock-index provider MSCI estimates that if policies such as trade protectionism and government deficit spending increase significantly in the developed world in the next two years, U.S. equities would shed more than 17%, while European equity markets would fall by close to 20%.<U+00A0>In a stress test run by MSCI, the firm assumes that such policies would lead to stagflation, a toxic combination of higher inflation and lower growth. Over the past 12 months, the MSCI Europe index is down 6.4%, while S&P 500 is up 4.9% Michael O<U+2019>Sullivan, chief investment officer for Europe at Credit Suisse , said investors are facing a <U+201C>postglobalization<U+201D> landscape. <U+201C>For markets, the slowdown in globalization means even more uncertainty,<U+201D> he said. Companies around the globe, from shippers to manufacturers, have already pointed to slowing trade and rising protectionism as a drag on profits. U.S.-based Deere & Co., the world<U+2019>s largest seller of tractors and harvesting combines, said earlier this year that protectionism and trade restrictions could hurt its results. In Australia, Ansell Ltd. , one of the world<U+2019>s biggest makers of condoms, sees the rise of political risk clouding its long-term outlook. The U.K.<U+2019>s vote to exit the European Union added <U+201C>an element of uncertainty in all of Europe,<U+201D> Chief Executive Magnus Nicolin said on the company<U+2019>s latest earnings call. It wasn<U+2019>t supposed to be this way. Equity valuations spiked in the early 1990s after the fall of the Berlin Wall ushered in the end of the Cold War. World trade boomed, McDonald<U+2019>s Corp. started flipping more burgers in China and Ford Motor Co. could manufacture pickup trucks cheaply in Thailand. U.S. stock valuations jumped above their 120-year average on the assumption of ever increasing global trade and easier movement of goods, services and capital across borders, said Christopher Mahon, director of asset allocation research also on the multiasset team at Barings. The globalization premium meant that U.S. stocks collectively traded at a price/earnings ratio roughly one whole number higher they otherwise would have, Barings estimates. P/E ratios, calculated by dividing stock prices by earnings per share, are a common measure of how expensive shares are. Barings calculated the premium by analyzing historical valuations and stripping out the impact of other variables such as inflation dynamics and central-bank policies. Calculating the globalization premium is the result of extensive debate among senior investment strategists at the firm, who pore over economic data, forecasts and research reports before deciding on a number every year. But that equation is changing. Over the past decade, Barings has cut the premium by half, and the firm<U+2019>s outlook for stocks is going down with it. Other fund managers say they are becoming more selective, shunning the sectors and countries they view as most likely to suffer from the resulting slowdown. <U+201C>Globalization is increasingly coming under siege,<U+201D> said Stefan Scheurer, senior market strategist at Allianz Global Investors. Mr. O<U+2019>Sullivan of Credit Suisse said the U.S. profit cycle correlates well with world trade. <U+201C>And in the past two years we had falling profits and slowing trade,<U+201D> he said. Companies listed in the S&P 500 derive more than 30% of their revenue overseas, according to FactSet. Global container-shipping operators have already cited the slowdown in trade as a major drag on profits, with the shipping industry facing its worst year since the 2008 financial crisis. The number of protectionist measures implemented around the globe so far this year has climbed to 338, according to researchers at Global Trade Alert, the highest for the corresponding period since they began tracking the figure in 2009 and up from 61 in the same period that year. Global Trade Alert is a trade-monitoring group coordinated by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, an independent research think tank based in London. Efforts to liberalize world trade have also stalled, including the trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, the potential free-trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union. In the U.S., the Peterson Institute for International Economics said the proposed trade policies of presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton would deeply hurt the American economy by slowing productivity growth. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re very concerned about the positions of both parties in trade,<U+201D> Fred Smith, chief executive at FedEx Corp. , said on the company<U+2019>s June earnings call. Some investors argue that even as globalization may be on the decline in the West, pockets of the world continue to open themselves up for trade, creating new investment opportunities. Sandra Crowl at French asset manager Carmignac points to Argentina, for instance, as a country that may benefit more from opening itself up to the world even as other countries, such as the U.S., become more protectionist. At Barings, managers favor moving away from equities and into fixed-income securities like bonds, which are likely to be more insulated from the turmoil. <U+201C>In March, I dare say we will be once again putting a haircut to our globalization premium,<U+201D> Mr. Mahon said. <U+201C>Or possibly cut it to zero.<U+201D> Write to Riva Gold at riva.gold@wsj.com and Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com",

Elizabeth Warren tacitly endorsed Kara Stein to replace SEC Chair Mary Jo White last month. | Getty By Patrick Temple-West 11/04/16 09:00 AM EDT When Sen. Elizabeth Warren last month demanded that President Barack Obama immediately replace SEC Chair Mary Jo White, she said the president could easily fill the position without Senate confirmation. That was a tacit endorsement of Kara Stein, the agency<U+2019>s lone Democratic commissioner, who could move into the top job without Senate involvement. Story Continued Below For Warren, it was probably the strongest hint yet at who she would like to see in government if Hillary Clinton is elected president. While the Massachusetts progressive has been clear about who she doesn<U+2019>t want to see in a Clinton administration <U+2014> almost anyone connected with Wall Street <U+2014> she has been less open in public about who she wants. In contrast to White, Stein has become a champion of progressives. Warren may not have spelled out her preference for the next SEC chair, but liberal groups allied with her are advocating for Stein. Her name has been on at least two of the lists they have drawn up of Wall Street watchdogs they would want Clinton to nominate, according to two people familiar with the matter. One of the people said liberals have recommended Stein to Clinton transition team officials Ed Meier and Ann O<U+2019>Leary. Other names that have been circulated by progressives for top jobs: Labor Secretary Tom Perez; former CFTC Commissioner Gary Gensler; Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin, and Heather Boushey, the chief economist on the Clinton transition team. By Seung Min Kim and Burgess Everett Stein, who has sometimes clashed with White in pushing for tougher penalties on misbehaving companies and for greater investor protection, is being promoted by liberals who have voiced disappointment in the current SEC chair. <U+201C>Kara Stein is viewed by many progressives as the lone beacon of hope at a SEC that has repeatedly fallen far short of their expectations,<U+201D> said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research for Compass Point Research & Trading in Washington. For the last three years, Warren and investor advocates have accused White of being too deferential toward businesses. Last year, the liberal advocacy group Credo Action hired a truck to drive around Washington with a billboard saying that White <U+201C>works for banks, not for you.<U+201D> In her Oct. 14 letter to Obama, Warren blasted White for not compelling corporations to disclose their political spending, saying the SEC chair, a former federal prosecutor, was failing <U+201C>to direct the agency's resources toward pressing matters of compelling interest to investors and the public.<U+201D> In a sign that she might be campaigning for a new job, Stein in August expanded and updated her biography page on the agency<U+2019>s website. Neither of the agency<U+2019>s other two commissioners have changed their official profiles since they started at the SEC in 2013. By Josh Gerstein and Madeline Conway An aide for Stein declined to comment. Stein, 52, drafted parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act while working for Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) on the Senate Banking Committee. She was appointed to the SEC by Obama in 2013, the same year Warren joined the Senate. Given her record at the agency, an SEC led by Stein would be a nightmare for corporations. Stein pressed for a stronger <U+201C>Volcker rule,<U+201D> the section of Dodd-Frank that banned banks from proprietary trading. She also hammered her fellow commissioners for voting to give financial firms permission to continue doing certain business operations after the companies agreed to misconduct settlements with the agency. Clinton, in her 2015 Wall Street regulatory plan, promised to strengthen the Volcker rule and criticized the SEC for generously issuing corporate waivers. <U+201C>A Stein-led SEC would likely take a more skeptical view of the markets as a whole, and that would seek to shelter investors since she often comes across as viewing markets as inherently dangerous places,<U+201D> said Thaya Brook Knight, associate director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. <U+201C>We might see an across-the-board shift toward a fearful view of market forces that would contrast with White<U+2019>s approach which, overall, has been more moderate and more restrained,<U+201D> she said.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Guest Post \n source: thesleuthjournal.com \n text: By: The Voice of Reason | We are less than two weeks away from the moment of truth, when the results of the 2016 Presidential election will more than likely be tallied, and we<U+2019>ll have a new President-elect, at least in name anyway, if nothing else. I<U+2019>ll preface this post by saying it<U+2019>s not too late for people to still take as many precautions as possible in hopes of ensuring their families safety not if, but when all hell breaks lose upon the announcement of the election<U+2019>s winner. The media has done their best to conceal it for whatever reason, but there have been ample warnings that there is the potential for massive amounts of violence regardless of who wins. The second video below runs through a laundry list of crimes committed by Hillary Clinton, which has a lot to do with why four in 10 Trump supporters say they won<U+2019>t recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn<U+2019>t have won fair and square. The second video cites specifics, and when you hear them, it<U+2019>s no wonder why former Congressman Joe Walsh called for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, <U+201C>On November 8th, I<U+2019>m voting for Trump . On November 9th, if Trump loses, I<U+2019>m grabbing my musket. You in?<U+201D> The former Congressman is hardly alone. A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; and one in five are likely voters are <U+201C>VERY concerned,<U+201D> and they should be. One 69-year old gentleman from Michigan said as the polls began shifting towards Hillary, he slowly began buying more ammunition. If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s political enemies. Recall that over 70 of them are dead, five of which died in just six weeks under mysterious circumstances during the primaries that Hillary stole from Bernie Sanders. In the first video below, I review warnings issued by both sides of what will happen if the other party<U+2019>s candidate wins. So far, if Hillary wins we have one former Congressman going for his gun, and if Trump wins, we have Black Lives Matter members saying saying back in March: <U+201C>Dear white people if Trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go. Just so you know.<U+201D> That<U+2019>s just the tip of the iceberg<U+2026> The question posed, <U+201C>What would you do,<U+201D> is primarily directed at Trump supporters if Hillary wins, because the only way she<U+2019>s winning anything, is by fraudulently stealing it, and doing so with Obama<U+2019>s help! How can we make that assertion without any doubt? Starting off light, we know not just from Project Veritas videos released this week , but also from Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, that an activist was caught on camera bragging about having helped start violent disruptions at Donald Trump campaign rallies, and brags that was paid by the Clinton campaign directly right before she stirred up trouble. The Project Veritas videos this week merely confirmed the initial account. We also know that despite Julian Assange saying he did not get information from the Russians, when Trump was beginning to pull away from Hillary in the polls, and Hillary needed a distraction, her and Barack Obama had no problem peddling a baseless accusation against Russia, eventually angering Putin to the point where Russia deployed nuclear missiles into Kaliningrad , along the border with Poland, and aimed them directly at our allies in Berlin. Nukes pointed at our allies? Who cares right? In her mind, <U+201C>the ends justify the means.<U+201D> so long as Hillary wins<U+2026> Then of course, let<U+2019>s not forget the email that was leaked by Wikileaks that proved that Hillary was not only aware of the transaction, but she allowed weapons to be sold to ISIS during a time of war , weapons that were presumably used against either U.S. troops or American allies at the very least. That act has a name: Treason, and it<U+2019>s punishable by death. Still, the list goes on, including her use of psychological weapons against voters as detailed in one of her internal campaign documents leaked as part of the Podesta emails. In the second video, Alex Jones makes his point very clearly, that there is NO level the Democrats won<U+2019>t stoop to for control of the White House. None. Zero. Furthermore, If by some chance all their fraud isn<U+2019>t enough, and Hillary doesn<U+2019>t win, they plan to burn American cities to the ground. Have you heard of any plans put in place by Obama to stop that? Of course not. Trump supporters: If Hillary is willing to do all those things, and so many more I don<U+2019>t have the time to go into but have all been well documented, just so she can gain entry into Oval Office, what do you think she<U+2019>ll act like once she takes possession of the Office of the President? We know what the Soros funded far-left has planned if Trump wins because they<U+2019>ve told us countless times, what about the Trump supporters if Hillary wins? In the video below, Alex Jones asks the question, <U+201C>Is there anything, anything at all that Hillary and the Democrats won<U+2019>t do?<U+201D> The answer to that seems clear. The question then is really whether people think that if Hillary is announced as the winner, is it likely that the American voters will put up with that criminal behavior and just roll over, or is it more likely we<U+2019>re going to see some violence break out?

But this election, the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump , has captured many of those blue-collar voters<U+2019> hearts, with his denunciation of trade deals and promises to bring back manufacturing. Take a tour of signature Springsteen spots to see which are turning toward Mr. Trump. Youngstown, Ohio Song: <U+201C>Youngstown<U+201D> Album: <U+201C>The Ghost of Tom Joad<U+201D> State of the race: Northeastern Ohio favors Mrs. Clinton <U+201C>Youngstown<U+201D> traces the long history of steel and iron production that has defined this working-class city. Mr. Trump has visited Youngstown and made revival of the steel industry a focus of his campaign, pledging to rebuild American cities<U+2019> infrastructure with steel produced in the United States. Still, he trails the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton , 46 percent to 33 percent, in northeastern Ohio, home to Youngstown and Cleveland, though he holds a slight edge statewide, according to a recent Suffolk University poll . _____ Atlantic City Song: <U+201C>Atlantic City<U+201D> Album: <U+201C>Nebraska<U+201D> State of the race: Southern New Jersey favors Mrs. Clinton This is one of many Springsteen songs tinted by the economic anxieties of the Carter-Reagan recession. In the 34 years since the song<U+2019>s release, the area has grown more distressed, largely because of the closings of casinos. But Mr. Trump has little traction here; Atlantic County, home to Atlantic City, is more ethnically diverse and economically depressed than most of the Jersey Shore, and appears to be leaning Democratic again this year. _____ Badlands National Park, S.D. Song: <U+201C>Badlands<U+201D> Album: <U+201C>Darkness on the Edge of Town<U+201D> In this song, the dry, craggy terrain of the badlands becomes a symbol of hard living and perseverance in the American West. Most of the badlands states, shaped by a frontier politics, vote reliably Republican, and Mr. Trump is ahead of Mrs. Clinton among likely voters here in the Dakotas and nearby Plains states, 43 percent to 36 percent, according to the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll . But many young adults here have been energized by the Libertarian candidate , Gary Johnson, who is drawing 13 percent, which may prevent Mr. Trump from running up a big victory margin. _____ Johnstown, Pa. Song: <U+201C>The River<U+201D> Album: <U+201C>The River<U+201D> State of the race: Mrs. Clinton has an edge in southwestern Pennsylvania The sense of malaise that Mr. Springsteen noted in blue-collar communities across America at the turn of the 1980s is still strongly felt in places like western Pennsylvania, where manufacturing jobs have largely vanished . White voters without a college degree are among Mr. Trump<U+2019>s strongest supporters there, as they are nationwide: 56 percent of these likely voters support him in a two-way race, versus 37 percent for Mrs. Clinton, according to this month<U+2019>s Quinnipiac University poll of Pennsylvania. But Mrs. Clinton is making that up with support from nonwhites <U+2014> three-quarters of whom say they will vote for her <U+2014> and more educated white voters. The poll gives her a five-point advantage over Mr. Trump statewide. _____ Amarillo, Tex. Song: <U+201C>Cadillac Ranch<U+201D> Album: <U+201C>The River<U+201D> State of the race: Northwestern Texas favors Mr. Trump <U+201C>Cadillac Ranch<U+201D> is a carefree, borderline-nonsensical salute to one of Mr. Springsteen<U+2019>s favorite themes: the joys of a good, shiny sedan. It is also a homage to the famed tourist attraction in Amarillo. The city<U+2019>s thriving economy revolves around meatpacking and defense contracting. A recent Texas Lyceum poll shows Mr. Trump leading Mrs. Clinton by just six points in Texas, and if that holds, he would win the state by a narrower margin than any Republican candidate since Bob Dole. But his fate seems secure in Amarillo, which is in the state<U+2019>s northwestern quadrant, where no statewide Republican candidate since 2010 has taken less than 70 percent. _____ Darlington County, S.C. Song: <U+201C>Darlington County<U+201D> Album: <U+201C>Born in the U.S.A.<U+201D> State of the race: South Carolina favors Mr. Trump Location: <U+201C>Darlington County<U+201D> tells the lighthearted story of two men who have left New York City behind and are cruising down Interstate 95, searching for work <U+2014> presumably escaping some unsavory business back home. The area is friendly to Mr. Trump, who trounced the field in South Carolina, including in Darlington County, where he defeated Senator Ted Cruz of Texas by roughly 10 points. No reliable general election polls have been published in South Carolina, but Mr. Trump should coast to victory here. No Democratic presidential nominee has won the state since 1976, two election cycles before Mr. Springsteen recorded this song. _____ Charlotte County, Fla. Song: <U+201C>Working on the Highway<U+201D> Album: <U+201C>Born in the U.S.A.<U+201D> State of the race: The Florida Gulf Coast favors Mr. Trump This song<U+2019>s narrator finds himself arrested and enlisted in a prison gang doing highway construction in Charlotte County, along Florida<U+2019>s Gulf Coast. The area is a conservative stronghold dominated by retirees and white-collar professionals. Ninety percent of county residents are white, and white Floridians overwhelmingly favor Trump, according to a recent Monmouth University poll . A separate poll by CNN/ORC gave him a lead of 49 percent to 33 percent in the central Gulf Coast region. Mr. Trump feels a special connection to Florida, which he calls his second home, and barely a week goes by that the candidate does not visit what his campaign considers one of the most important states in the general election.

Didn<U+2019>t Donald Trump disqualify himself with his racist and sexist statements? What about the nuclear codes? \nWell, Donald Trump had one thing in his favor: he ran against one of the most unpopular and despised presidential candidates in American history, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Combine the electorate<U+2019>s Clinton antipathy with a risky but targeted strategy to flip the Rust Belt and it<U+2019>s not so hard to understand why Donald Trump, a man with no experience in government, will be sitting in the oval office come late January.\nThe usual suspects have had no luck in crafting a convincing narrative that doesn<U+2019>t make them look like idiots. Joan Walsh of The Nation, a shameless hack for Hillary, wrote a sardonic piece wherein she played the victim and defended Clinton<U+2019>s candidacy, saying, <U+201C>she had more of a message than her lefty haters give her credit for.<U+201D>\nActually, no, not really. Clinton ran the definition of a negative campaign and what little of a progressive message she presented was copy and pasted from Senator Bernie Sanders<U+2019> campaign and extremely unconvincing given her neoliberal record. Clinton had trust issues from the beginning, which were only exacerbated by her extremely dishonest attacks on Sanders and equally dishonest revisionism of her own herstory. \nJamelle Bouie, whose biggest claim to fame is saying Trump could not win, offers another equally moronic analysis of Trump voters, claiming anyone who voted for Trump is a racist and deserves no empathy. Yes, African-Americans, Asians, and non-white Hispanics voted for Trump, but according to Bouie they apparently hate themselves.\nBouie is reliably wrong, so expect him to fail up in pundit world. But his blame the voter strategy parallels that of bourgeoisie feminists, who claim women who voted for Trump (or even just did not for Clinton) did so because they have <U+201C>internalized misogyny.<U+201D> Jess McIntosh, the former communications director for the Clinton campaign, made that explicit claim in an interview with DNC-friendly MSNBC. \nSo, to recap, anyone who did not vote for Hillary Clinton this cycle hates minorities and women (including minorities and women).\nWell, allow me to retort. Hillary Clinton lost the election because she was a terrible candidate. Nobody likes or trusts her (yes, elections actually are popularity contests) and her neoliberal domestic policies and neoconservative foreign policies turned people off because they are genuinely bad. Clinton represented the establishment in a change election, something she was happy to do. She even openly courted Republicans hoping her <U+201C>temperament<U+201D> talking point would make partisan Republicans vote for one of the most hated Democrats in history. It didn<U+2019>t work.\nClinton also refused to talk about class and only seriously brought up racism to label Trump supporters as racist <U+201C>deplorables<U+201D> and <U+201C>irredeemable.<U+201D> Which, beyond excessively judgmental, was just stupid politics as many of those people live in the god damn Rust Belt. Way to ensure they voted Hillary! If Clinton is so smart, why is she so stupid? Riddle me that.\nNow, thank the lord, we as a country are going to move on from the Clinton crime family. The Democratic Party needs a major overhaul, which it will have plenty of time to focus on as it is now out of power in the House, Senate, and White House. Great job, Team Hillary.\nBut first, how about the Hillary Clinton supporters stop blaming everyone else for their terrible candidate? Democrats had a populist who did well in the Rust Belt, Clinton supporters did everything they could to destroy him. This election is on them.\nThe post Dear Hillary Supporters, Own Your Terrible Candidate appeared first on Shadowproof .\n",

        "input": "time: null \n author: The Doc \n source: silverdoctors.com \n text: The Next Big Shoe to Drop Posted on   The Next Big Shoe to Drop \nThis is yet another source of highly flammable fuel that will result in more gasoline when the Fed is called in<U+2026> \n\nFrom Dr. Jeffrey Lewis : \nMore than 40 million young Americans carry federal and private student loan debt <U+2013> amounting to over $1 trillion. Defaults are on the rise and the issue has grown to become a nasty wealth transfer mechanism, as well as sad example of the failure of finance in general. \nThis week, President Obama announced a new initiative framed as a way of addressing the issue. Sadly, it is far from the mark, and just one more indication that monetary masters are the real puppeteers. \nMany have pointed out that the student loan debt bubble could be the next subprime crisis. \nPerhaps so, but it is potentially much worse, acting as an anvil when considered in the context of other consumer debt like car loans and credit cards. \nThe student debt debacle has the potential of corrupting not only education, but a generation as well. \nIt risks becoming the blight on a generation of would-be productive and innovative work force. \nFurthermore, the workforce declines, and falls behind, as more students return home to live with parents. And the extra burden on multi-generational households adds yet another deflationary force to the natural trend. \nFrom the perspective of bankers, policy makers, and the propaganda machine, college loan programs have been a tremendous success, providing access for students who would otherwise not be able to afford the privilege. \nIt is about threading a narrow political path. \nDefaults are on the rise and the notional value of student loans went north of $1 trillion. \nServicers must be getting nervous; the lobbyists are circling the wagons. \nThere is no clear indication of who will pay for it <U+2013> or how. \nDefaults on the rise; one in seven currently default. \nThe news of doing something comes around to yet another intervention with all the familiar signs that it is meant to save the financiers and has very little to do with helping students. \nThe problem is that this is too little too late. \nStudent loan debt is a trillion dollar reality in the context of a major, ongoing depression. \nWe are a Nanny state <U+2013> with almost 50 million on food stamps and more on some sort of assistance. Labor force participation is at 40 year lows. \nThere is already a major dis-incentive to work. If you take a horrible minimum wage job, you lose valuable benefits, entitlements. \nWhich, incidentally, also explains why while it took the U.S. economy 6 years to recover all the job losses since Lehman. This took place at the expense of 13 million Americans leaving the labor force for good even as the U.S. population rose by 15 million. \nIt also means that using a historical average participation rate, U.S. unemployment is over 11%, while underemployment is currently well in the 20% range <U+2013> a far more realistic assessment of where the U.S. economy really is. \nPeople on assistance programs are literally paid to stay home <U+2013> think of the cultural implications. \nIt<U+2019>s almost a conspiracy. You have a massive class of under the table people with no voice. Give them bread and circuses. \nThe student loan debacle is another story. \nFor the parents, the typical situation is framed by skyrocketing tuition; and little help from scholarships become fractions in the face of rising tuition. \nThe income cut-off for need-based financial aid is low. \nParents are expected to contribute 25% of pre-tax income to the cost of tuition. \nIf you earn $80K a year and your child<U+2019>s college tuition is $20K, you get nothing in terms of need-based financial aid. And that 25% doesn<U+2019>t count room & board, books, etc. \nSo, it<U+2019>s basically impossible for middle-class families to send their kids to college without taking out student loans. In fact, the entire higher-education system is built to force people into debt if they want to send their kids to college. \nAnd it has a sinister underlying theme<U+2026> \nIt<U+2019>s always about the <U+201C>irresponsible student<U+201D> or the <U+201C>hairdresser subprime loan borrower<U+201D> who <U+201C>should have known better<U+201D>. \nThey should have known that housing prices eventually fall, even though <U+201C>everyone<U+201D> in the mainstream, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve said they would not. They should have read carefully the fine print instead of trusting the fancy loan officer. \nAnd everyone knows that without a college education you will not succeed, so <U+201C>borrow whatever it takes<U+201D>. You<U+2019>ll pay it back. \nTwo decades of further tweaks to the bankruptcy code ensued until 2005, when Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. This Act made it so that no student loan <U+2014> federal or private <U+2014> could be discharged in bankruptcy unless the borrower can prove repaying the loan would cause <U+201C>undue hardship,<U+201D> a condition that is incredibly difficult to demonstrate unless the person has a severe disability. It essentially lumps student loan debt in with child support and criminal fines <U+2014> other types of debt that can<U+2019>t be discharged. \nBut our system is perfectly fine going after the invisible <U+2013> those without a political voice <U+2013> whether the poor or elderly who get crushed by inflation, or the 18 year olds who get out with $100K in debt and an art appreciation degree. \nBut the price of education should tell an even deeper story<U+2026>. \nQuality of Education Suffers \nThe compounding irony is that not only does the price of education go up, but the quality goes down. Institutions become entrenched. There is little incentive evolve, tenure runs rampant. And the curriculum declines. \nHigher education becomes both a commodity and a spectacle. Not a vehicle for progress or a reflection of the needs of the culture or the economy. \nThat may not be hyperinflation<U+2026>but it<U+2019>s very sad. College education quality has not risen proportionately with price. \nStudent loan debt is out of control by any and all measures. It<U+2019>s a debacle that benefits no one besides the banker and the servicers. The schools lose by making themselves unviable in the long run. \nThe students come away with non-dischargeable student loans and enter a world without, for the most part, having any marketable skills. \nSadly, the student loans are just one more politically untouchable issue providing yet another source of highly flammable fuel that will result in more gasoline when the Fed is called in.",

Since its founding in 1901, the university and its scientists have been pioneers in a broad range of fields. from infectious diseases to Alzheimer<U+2019>s disease, AIDS and opiate addiction. But today, the university, like many endowed institutions, has become a subject in a grand experiment run by global central bankers exploring uncharted territory in interest-rate policy and market intervention. In this monetary experiment<U+2014>to paraphrase <U+201C>Pogo<U+201D> cartoonist Walt Kelly <U+2014>we have met the lab mice and they are us. Barring a monetary U-turn prompted by the Trump administration, our future may not be rosy. Since the onset of ultra-low interest rates in 2008, returns to savers, both individual and institutional, have been in relentless decline. They are expected to fall further, even while costs for services like health care and education continue to rise well above the rate of the general consumer-price index. Pension plans are increasingly underfunded and the boards of most universities are anxiously discussing the implications of lower endowment returns for budgets going forward. According to Cambridge Associates, in the decade that ended June 30, 2016, the average annual return for even large sophisticated endowments (those with assets over $1 billion) fell below 6%. With average annual spending rates of 5% or higher, and the inflation-measuring Higher Education Price Index growing at an annual rate above 2%, most endowments have lost ground unless they had substantive new giving. This means less research, less scholarship aid and less opportunity for future generations. For scientific research in particular, declines in endowment funding coinciding with persistent declines in government funding would be particularly unfortunate. Good scientists know that correlation does not imply causation<U+2014>the coincidence of extreme monetary measures with declining real, or after-inflation returns does not prove that monetary policy has caused returns to decline. But the concurrence should prompt some questions. Most obviously, negative real rates<U+2014>below-zero rates, after adjustment for inflation<U+2014>punish bond investors. The more conservative the investment strategy, the worse the punishment, pushing both individuals and institutions further out on the risk curve than they otherwise would or should be. In theory, all prudent investors hold some bonds to provide much-needed diversification and guaranteed income<U+2014>a haven from equity-market volatility. Negative real rates destroy this safe harbor. First, the guaranteed income is now a guaranteed loss. Second, at very low interest rates, the price of bonds becomes much more sensitive to even small changes in interest rates. In bond speak, the duration of all bonds is increasing<U+2014>making any upward adjustment in interest rates extremely painful. Negative real rates may hurt investors in more insidious ways as well. An extremely low cost of capital may result in excess capital investment that in turn results in boom-bust cycles of increasing frequency and magnitude. Housing, energy and steel come to mind as recent examples of excessive investing gone bad. Shopping malls and retail may well be next up at bat. Evidence of this can be seen in periodic blowouts in credit markets. It can also been seen in the sustained increase in the rolling 10-year observed volatility of the S&P 500, which has remained nearly double its long-term average even while implied or expected volatility remains very low. More broadly, a lower cost of capital lowers the bar for returns on capital investment<U+2014>potentially reducing the productivity of capital overall. We might also ask what happens to consumption spending when unprecedented aging in the world<U+2019>s largest economies meets punitive treatment of pensioners. By 2030, Rockefeller University scientist Joel Cohen notes, based on United Nations predictions, the proportion of the population over age 65 will hit 20% in the U.S. and 30% in Japan and Germany, even while expected lifespans continue to increase. That we will have to raise the retirement age seems obvious, but what will this mean for consumption and job growth? There may be a tipping point where low expected returns on savings forces more savings instead of more consumption. Whatever the cause, declining returns on investment deplete the coffers of America<U+2019>s most important incubators of science and technology. The grand experiment may well be stimulating demand in some corners<U+2014>but it is undoubtedly killing savers, pensioners and endowed institutions. It may also be impoverishing the elderly and increasing the burden of their care on the young. These are serious consequences indeed. At a very minimum, we should be examining these costs with greater urgency, honesty and analytical heft. If we have to be mice, let<U+2019>s not be blind in the bargain. Ms. Falls is the chief investment officer at Rockefeller University, where she oversees the university<U+2019>s $2 billion endowment.",

Thanks to the incredibly fast processing power of computers in this day and age, early votes were counted in record time giving the soon-to-be-President an entire extra day to get ready for his imminent Presidency.

Atkins, a former financial regulator who is playing a major role in the Trump presidential transition, has railed against labor unions, environmentalists and gay rights groups for challenging public companies through shareholder activism. He has called companies <U+201C>weenies<U+201D> who often \"cave\" to social activists. And he was once the only one of 68 business leaders who refused to endorse a report recommending ways to combat <U+201C>crony capitalism<U+201D> in Washington. Story Continued Below Now Atkins, a Republican and onetime SEC member, may be in line to land a top regulatory post in the Trump administration. Atkins is meeting with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence in New York on Monday. Atkins, the transition<U+2019>s team leader for financial regulatory agencies, is on the same page as Trump on a number of issues, most notably on Dodd-Frank, the sweeping market-reform law that the president-elect says he wants to dismantle. Atkins has testified in the House three times in the last three years about the side-effects of the 2010 law, which was enacted after the financial crisis and is one of President Barack Obama<U+2019>s signature policies. But comments of his, recorded at a 2012 Heritage Foundation event, reveal candid criticism of global-warming believers, organized labor and other Democratic allies. That suggests Atkins<U+2019>s influence could help companies well beyond Dodd-Frank deregulation. <U+201C>While Paul is in some ways more of an establishment Republican, I would put him in the free-market category,<U+201D> said Thaya Brook Knight, an official at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank. She added that she was <U+201C>thrilled<U+201D> with Atkins<U+2019> position on the Trump team. As for whether Atkins would return to government for Trump, Knight said <U+201C>it is customary<U+201D> for transition team people to end up in a president<U+2019>s administration. Others are not as thrilled at that prospect. <U+201C>Tick down the list of issues we care about and you will typically find him on the other side,<U+201D> said Lisa Gilbert, an official with Public Citizen, a liberal advocacy group. <U+201C>We are nervous about what his placement in the transition means,<U+201D> Gilbert said. Atkins<U+2019> status in Trump<U+2019>s Washington world is quickly becoming apparent. A member of the SEC from 2002 to 2008, Atkins is on the transition landing teams for multiple agencies <U+2014> the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. One of Atkins<U+2019> former staffers at the SEC is also on a landing team. Atkins is a top candidate to be the Federal Reserve<U+2019>s vice chairman for supervision, according to two sources familiar with the matter. That post <U+2014> a powerful position charged with overseeing regulation of the nation<U+2019>s financial institutions <U+2014> has not been filled by the Obama administration since it was created out of Dodd-Frank. Atkins is currently chief executive of Patomak Global Partners, a consulting firm he founded, and he was a senior partner at Sphere Consulting, a public relations firm in Washington. During his time at the SEC, he demonstrated a preference for putting a light touch on regulations. He dissented from a plan to overhaul rules for the stock market in 2005. He also dissented from rules for hedge funds in 2004 that were later struck down in court. And he opposed big fines that the SEC imposed on companies as part of enforcement settlements. Another similarity to Trump is that Atkins isn<U+2019>t afraid to go against the consensus. In October 2015, he was the only dissenter among dozens of business leaders who were asked to draw up a report titled <U+201C>Crony Capitalism: Unhealthy relations between business and government.<U+201D> The report called for enacting stricter prohibitions on the revolving door from Congress to K Street lobbying firms, and it advocated for campaign-finance reform, among other measures. It is unclear why Atkins opposed the report. A spokeswoman for Atkins referred questions to the Trump transition team, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Atkins has also criticized labor unions, environmental organizations, gay-rights groups and state pension funds that he has said try to <U+201C>co-opt or disenfranchise<U+201D> companies. He has spoken in favor of the American Legislative Exchange Council, the controversial, Koch brothers-backed group that has pushed for voter ID laws and <U+201C>stand your ground<U+201D> statutes in many states. He has also defended anonymous <U+201C>dark money<U+201D> in politics. <U+201C>ALEC is a great organization,<U+201D> Atkins said at the July 3, 2012, Heritage Foundation event, according to an audio recording available online. In 2012, after the shooting of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida, Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods Inc. and other businesses withdrew funding for ALEC. According to Atkins, the companies were reacting to attacks from Moveon.org and Color of Change, both liberal-leaning advocacy groups. <U+201C>This is part of a thing that we<U+2019>ve seen this year where social activists, environmental groups and other sorts of gay rights groups and others <U+2014> unions, state pension funds and even politicians <U+2014> have been very open about what their goal is,<U+201D> Atkins said at the Heritage event. <U+201C>And that is to put pressure on corporations through the shareholder proposal process.<U+201D> He also referred to the scrutiny focused on Target Corp., which in 2010 apologized for contributing to Minnesota Forward, a group that gave money to gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer, who opposed same-sex marriage. <U+201C>Corporations usually are weenies, and they don<U+2019>t really want to be in a political fight,<U+201D> Atkins said. <U+201C>They often cave.<U+201D> Atkins made these comments during a discussion about shareholder proposals. Though they are nonbinding, votes on such proposals can steer a company<U+2019>s management toward a social cause advocated by the investor. In August 2015, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it would stop selling the AR-15 assault rifle, despite winning a court battle with a shareholder<U+2019>s proposal seeking to rein in firearm sales at the retail giant. <U+201C>They do it all over the Fortune 500, which then gives them a megaphone of free publicity through the process and through harassment of the corporations, because then the management wants to negotiate with them to get rid of their proposal,<U+201D> Atkins said at the event, referring to activist groups. Using the shareholder voting process to push companies on social issues has been a common practice of progressive pension funds for unions. But the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative, tax-exempt group based in Washington, has also successfully adopted the technique. Over the years, the SEC<U+2019>s rules have been changed to benefit social activists, and that needs to swing back, he said. <U+201C>The next big fight is going to be over corporate governance rules and shareholder communications and how corporations interact with shareholders,<U+201D> he told the audience. <U+201C>Because right now the rules have really drifted way off to one side like I said between co-opting and disenfranchising. So I think it is going to have to be radically changed back.<U+201D> Labor unions will resist the rule changes, Atkins said. As their memberships decline, the unions are well aware of the tactical value the shareholder process gives them. <U+201C>This is their last power,<U+201D> he said.

McCaskill and Katie Glueck 11/09/16 01:24 PM EST So much for the Republican resistance. Reality has set in for the Never Trump Republicans, who just days ago were strategizing about how to reshape their party in a post-Trump world. Now, they are coming to terms with the harsh truth: They lost, Trumpism won and there is little appetite right now for any of the GOP internecine warfare that raged for much of this year, even in the name of principle. Story Continued Below <U+201C>Let<U+2019>s just say the pause button just got hit on the Republican civil war in the aftermath of a victory where the Republican Party is in a stronger position, top to bottom, than it<U+2019>s been in, say, 100 years,<U+201D> said David French, a conservative leader of the Never Trump movement who was so disheartened by the presidential options earlier this year that he weighed mounting his own independent bid. <U+201C>It doesn<U+2019>t mean there won<U+2019>t be strife and division. But as far as any large-scale GOP conflict, that<U+2019>s not going to happen. This is a large-scale GOP win. There may be some score-settling directed toward the Never Trumpers, but the electoral impact of Never Trump was marginal at best.<U+201D> It<U+2019>s a sharp departure from what many Never Trumpers were expecting and hoping for days ago: Serious soul-searching about how to make the party more inclusive, and how to ensure that what they saw as Trump<U+2019>s brand of grievance-driven populism and nativism didn<U+2019>t define the GOP going forward. Expecting a Trump loss, many saw an opportunity to reshape their party going forward, and were eager to see the hardline views<U+2014>and people and organizations<U+2014>who helped propel Trump forward, stamped out. <U+201C>The fear a lot of people have is that the energy is with the Breitbart crowd, and people who would consider themselves to be more traditional Republicans, who do they rally behind? Who<U+2019>s the leader, the face of that?<U+201D> said a former GOP party official in an interview before the election. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s a lot of concern going around.<U+201D> And with good reason. As the dust settles, it<U+2019>s not clear that they have anyone else to rally behind: Trump, as the president-elect, is the new head of the GOP, and some of his most pointed critics made sure to offer public expressions of support. <U+201C>Best wishes for our duly elected president: May his victory speech be his guide and preserving the Republic his aim,<U+201D> tweeted Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee who delivered a speech in Utah encouraging Republican primary voters to support whichever candidate had the best chance to beat Trump in a given state. Romney, along with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, did not vote for Trump. <U+201C>Congratulations on your victory @realDonaldTrump,<U+201D> tweeted Jeb Bush, who Trump savaged during the primary and dubbed <U+201C>low energy.<U+201D> <U+201C>As our President, Columba and I will pray for you in the days and months to come.<U+201D> <U+201C>The American people have spoken and it<U+2019>s time to come together. Congratulations President-elect @realDonaldTrump ,<U+201D> Kasich, who voted for 2008 GOP nominee John McCain, wrote on Twitter. Graham and Sasse, darlings of the Never Trump movement, also offered congratulatory words and sounded conciliatory notes, pointing to areas where they hoped to work together. It<U+2019>s not that the conservatives who staunchly opposed Trump have suddenly come around to embracing his views on the issues and tone they have long found troubling. Many continue to have grave concerns, and some are considering leaving the party for good, fearing that a Trump-led GOP will cater, above all, to angry older white voters who propelled Trump<U+2019>s candidacy, though clearly his appeal ultimately went beyond just that constituency, as Democratic turnout for Hillary Clinton also appeared to be down. <U+201C>From my point of view, that<U+2019>s a huge problem for the Republican Party: Is it going to be a party for all Americans, not merely white Americans?<U+201D> asked Avik Roy, a prominent conservative who has advocated for a more inclusive Republican Party. <U+201C>While there are going to be plenty of partisan Republicans happy about Trump winning, it<U+2019>s not going to mean anything over the long term unless the Republican Party can be a party that addresses the concerns of all Americans, and builds a coalition that is demographically diverse.<U+201D> But in the short term, they<U+2019>re hoping for the best and staying focused on the good news: Republican control of both chambers of Congress, with enough Republicans in leadership positions who take more of a traditional GOP perspective on issues like free trade and an internationalist foreign policy, and have used more inclusive language toward immigrants. <U+201C>I hope some of his more heated rhetoric was campaign trail rhetoric, and when he gets into office he sits down coolly and calmly and talks with Republican leaders in Congress like Speaker Ryan,<U+201D> said Brendan Steinhauser, a conservative operative who was a vocal Trump opponent. Still, he and other conservatives maintained that conservatives need to continue to press their case, even if the Never Trump vehicle for doing so faces defeat. <U+201C>I guess NeverTrump has been overtaken by events!<U+201D> said Bill Kristol, the editor of the conservative publication The Weekly Standard. <U+201C>But American conservatism (which incorporates classical liberalism) remains far preferable, in my view, to nanny-state progressivism or grievance-stoking populism. So we conservatives have to do three things at once: adapt to new circumstances, do a better job of persuading, and keep the flag flying.<U+201D> On Twitter, he was even more blunt about the state of the movement. <U+201C>To my fellow #NeverTrumpers,<U+201D> tweeted, <U+201C>Let us be magnanimous losers.<U+201D> By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

Four percent favored Donald Trump. That may be just another poll, but if Mrs. Clinton is elected it should serve as encouragement for her tough-on-Russia views, and for putting them forward directly to Chancellor Angela Merkel as the leader of the United States<U+2019> most important ally. Just how far the European Union, and Germany as its essential member, are from any kind of decisive response to Russia<U+2019>s savagery in Syria or anywhere else was demonstrated last week when the EU said it is <U+201C>considering all available options should the current atrocities continue.<U+201D> The wording of the final document was defanged to remove references from earlier drafts to <U+201C>sanctions,<U+201D> or to Russians who might be targeted by them. Threats of using <U+201C>all available options<U+201D> were about as likely to scare Vladimir Putin as the Obama administration<U+2019>s repetition of the word <U+201C>unacceptable<U+201D> spooked the mullahs during negotiations with Iran on a nuclear weapons agreement. An accompanying and revelatory glimpse on the enforcement of existing EU sanctions: Vladislav Surkov, a Russian regime figure who has been barred from entry into the EU since 2014 following Russia<U+2019>s seizure of Crimea, attended a meeting Wednesday in Berlin between Mr. Putin and Mrs. Merkel to discuss Ukraine. A German press report said he had received a special dispensation. Here<U+2019>s a scared Germany, declining in stability, in the midst of an ineffectual Europe. The pillars of probity that were Deutsche Bank and Volkswagen are gone; Bundeswehr units supporting the anti-Islamic State coalition avoid lethal action in Iraq; and a pro-Russian right-wing party is likely to enter the Bundestag in 2017. Mrs. Clinton surely sees the chancellor<U+2019>s relative fragility. But there is one area in relation to Russia where, as a president-elect, she could urge Mrs. Merkel to take a nonmilitary but realpolitik stance that would represent Germany reuniting with its better instincts. Mrs. Clinton should call on the chancellor to renounce the construction of Nord Stream 2, the second Russia-to-Germany direct undersea natural-gas pipeline. Scheduled to come online in 2019, it<U+2019>s backed by Gazprom and five European minority investors, two of them German. European critics have called it dangerous and politically inspired because Nord Stream 2 would dramatically increase Europe<U+2019>s and Germany<U+2019>s dependency on Russian-sourced natural gas to 80% and 60%, respectively. The pipeline replicates the Baltic Sea track of Nord Stream 1, which currently operates at only 70% of its intended capacity. Nord Stream 1 was promoted by Gerhard Schr<U+00F6>der, the former Social Democratic chancellor, whose political desires included Germany<U+2019>s <U+201C>emancipation<U+201D> from America. Since his defeat by Mrs. Merkel in 2005, he has served as a Gazprom shill, being named this month as chairman of Nord Stream 2. Before Mrs. Clinton was photographed holding the symbolic button for the Obama administration<U+2019>s failed reset with Russia, she had warned in 2009, as the designated U.S. Secretary of State, that Russian control of European energy supply was <U+201C>a challenge we ignore at our peril.<U+201D> Now, it<U+2019>s time to block Nord Stream 2. This would hardly be good ol<U+2019> unilateral America in action, although that wouldn<U+2019>t be a bad thing under the circumstances. Also vigorously opposed are German mainstream heavyweights such as Manfred Weber, who heads the Christian Democrat political grouping in the European Parliament, and to his left, Reinhard B<U+00FC>tikofer, who is chief of the Greens<U+2019> delegation. Norbert R<U+00F6>ttgen, the Christian Democratic president of the Bundestag<U+2019>s foreign-relations commission, in a reference to linking Nord Stream 2 and Russia<U+2019>s Syrian abominations, told me: <U+201C>What we need is a transatlantic relaunch helping to redefine the German-American approach to an aggressive Russia.<U+201D> But Mrs. Merkel is described as regarding the pipeline as a private, commercial project, although she campaigned in 2005 to stop Nord Stream 1. Within months of her election, she flip-flopped to endorse the project and assuage her Social Democrat coalition partners. Eleven years later, led by Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, the Social Democrats remain zealous, Russia-friendly advocates of Nord Stream 2. The chancellor has not pushed back. Could a newly elected President Clinton, seemingly willing to reassert an American leadership role on Russia, decide that fighting off its energy hold on Europe can wait without risking peril? Remember that in 2010 she rolled back her call for crippling sanctions against Iran in favor of <U+201C>smart<U+201D> ones that <U+201C>would not contribute to the suffering of everyday Iranians.<U+201D> Here<U+2019>s a test of credibility. In order to pass, Mrs. Clinton has to tell Mrs. Merkel and the 90% of Germans supporting her candidacy against Mr. Trump that they cannot allow Mr. Putin to employ new energy exports to finance Russia<U+2019>s dearest destructive goals<U+2014>which unmistakably aim at Germany<U+2019>s effective neutralization.",

She also plans to wear a pantsuit. Ms. Chamberlain, 33, has also recruited thousands of others who are hoping to see the election of the first female U.S. president. A private Facebook group she created dubbing<U+00A0>Nov. 8<U+00A0>as <U+201C>National Pantsuit Day<U+201D> has drawn more than 600,000 members<U+00A0>in two weeks. On the page, the invitation-only members trade stories about their admiration for the Democratic nominee and discuss plans to sport their own version of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s signature campaign-trail attire. <U+201C>There is a literal pantsuit thing happening, which does involve shopping for some and rummaging around in closets for others,<U+201D> Ms. Chamberlain said. <U+201C>But so much more important is the idea that we can take this symbol of feminism and the struggle for equality and own it. Literally wear it to the polls.<U+201D> Republican rival Donald Trump <U+2019>s backers are also seeking to show support for their candidate. On some conservative blogs and Reddit, they are encouraging each other to wear red on<U+00A0>Nov. 8. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s warning that the election could be rigged has some supporters nervous that their vote won<U+2019>t be counted. Their solution: Create a sea of red that can<U+2019>t be ignored. The same <U+201C>wear red<U+201D> text has been copied and pasted repeatedly, like a modern-day chain letter, on the message board Reddit and multiple conservative blogs. Some of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s fans face a tricky challenge: finding a pantsuit. The candidate<U+2019>s clothes are custom made, and pantsuits aren<U+2019>t a staple in many women<U+2019>s closets. At 67, Camy Clough remembers when she wasn<U+2019>t allowed to wear pants to work. Then, she had a closet full of pantsuits as they came into vogue in the 1970s. She recently donated many of them to charity but luckily kept a few in the closet. <U+201C>I have a black tweedy pantsuit, and then I<U+2019>m hoping the next day I can come to work wearing ivory slacks and a sweater with a scarf that has purple and gold in it,<U+201D> said Ms. Clough, a museum educator in Washington, D.C. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s all of the colors of the women<U+2019>s suffrage movement.<U+201D> Historically, pants were seen as a man<U+2019>s prerogative. As women started wearing loose versions of what are now known as pants in the latter half of the 1800s, it was seen as usurping gender roles, said Kevin Jones, museum curator for the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in Los Angeles. The modern women<U+2019>s pantsuit, often monotone or patterned slacks and a jacket, hit the stage with the women<U+2019>s movement of the 1970s. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s what we know it as today, the <U+2018>power suit,<U+2019> <U+201D> said Kevin Jones, museum curator for the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in Los Angeles. <U+201C>That was a really heady time of a woman wearing whatever she wanted to wear.<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s candidacy has the potential to turn it into the ultimate power outfit. On the campaign trail, she has embraced the sometimes-maligned ensemble as a badge of honor<U+2014>much like the way her female fans latched onto Mr. Trump<U+2019>s <U+201C>nasty woman<U+201D> labeling in their final debate. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s Twitter bio describes her as a <U+201C>pantsuit-aficionado,<U+201D> and she<U+2019>s nicknamed some of her most ardent followers as <U+201C>my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits.<U+201D> The campaign<U+2019>s website offered an <U+201C>everyday pantsuit<U+201D> unisex T-shirt for $30 until it sold out. It is now on a wait list. Amanda Reddy, 38, stopped at a department store near her home in Columbia, Md., to pick up a white pantsuit. When the sales clerk complimented Ms. Reddy on her choice, Ms. Reddy told her it was in honor of the suffragists who had campaigned for the Nineteenth Amendment that gave women the right to vote. <U+201C>They used fashion to create a visual identity for their movement and to make it easy for others to express support, even if they weren<U+2019>t the ones being arrested or harassed in the street,<U+201D> Ms. Reddy said. <U+201C>So the white pantsuit is for them.<U+201D> After hearing the story, the saleswoman gave Ms. Reddy a discount. Ms. Chamberlain started her Facebook group so she and her friends would have a place to stand <U+201C>together in a great big pant-suited mass telling each other stories and lifting each other up after an election season that has left many of us wounded, jostled, disheartened, and afraid.<U+201D> As one friend invited another, the group ballooned. In a week, it had 100,000 members.<U+00A0>In 10 days, there were 200,000. As of<U+00A0>Friday, they stood at more than 609,000. Her friend, Caddie Jackson, 34, of Massachusetts, plans to match her candidate, right down to the color she wore in the third debate. <U+201C>I went out right away and I bought a white pantsuit that I<U+2019>m so excited to wear on<U+00A0>Nov. 8,<U+201D> Ms. Jackson said. It cost her $8 at Goodwill. Elana Snow, an administrator in Somerville, Mass., surveyed her closet, which is full of professional separates that could be pulled together, but no pantsuits. <U+201C>I think I<U+2019>m just going to go to Goodwill and get a matchy bright one,<U+201D> she said. Ms. Chamberlain, a school counselor in the Blue Hill area of Maine, had hoped to shop for her outfit this week but lost time managing her growing Facebook project. She<U+00A0>ordered three pantsuits online, two from Macy<U+2019>s and one from Amazon, to have one in time for Election Day. Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com",

Duterte's tirades against the former colonial power are routine during his speeches and he said on Wednesday he once believed in Washington, but had since lost respect for what is the Philippines' biggest ally. The U.S. State Department halted the sale of the assault rifles to the Philippine police after U.S. Senator Ben Cardin said he would oppose it, Senate aides told Reuters on Monday. Aides said Cardin, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was reluctant for the United States to provide the weapons given concern about human rights violations in the Philippines during Duterte's bloody, four-month-old war on drugs. \n\"Look at these monkeys, the 26,000 firearms we wanted to buy, they don't want to sell,\" Dutertesaid during a televised speech. \n\"Son of a b***h, we have many home-made guns here. These American fools.\" \nMore than 2,300 people have been killed in police operations or by suspected vigilantes as part of Duterte's anti-narcotics campaign, which was the lynchpin of his election campaign. \nDuterte has vented his anger at the United States for raising concerns about the extra-judicial killings. \n\"That's why I was rude at them, because they were rude at me,\" he said. \nAccording to procedures in Washington, the State Department informs Congress when international weapons sales are in the works. Aides said the State Department had been informed Cardin would oppose the deal during the prenotification process, thus halting the sale. \nU.S. State Department officials did not comment. \nThe Philippine police chief, Ronald dela Rosa, on Tuesday expressed disappointment that police would not get the M4 rifles, which he said were reliable. \nDuterte reiterated that Russia and China had shown willingness to sell arms to the Philippines, but he would wait to see if his military wanted to continue using U.S. weapons. \n\"Russia, they are inviting us. China also. China is open, anything you want, they sent me brochure saying we select there, we'll give you. \n\"But I am holding off because I was asking the military if they have any problem. Because if you have, if you want to stick to America, fine. \n\"But, look closely and balance the situation, they are rude to us.\" Article by Doc Burkhart , Vice-President, General Manager and co-host of TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles Got a news tip?

This is big news. After six months of meeting with the animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), Association of Zoos and Aquariums (A.Z.A.), Global Wildlife Conservation (G.W.C.) and a few others, one of the world<U+2019>s largest travel websites announced that it will no longer sell tickets to animal attractions that exploit and may put endangered or wild animals at risk. This means tourists will no longer be afforded the option to ride elephants, pet tigers, or swim with dolphins <U+2013> at least not through TripAdvisor. The purpose is to take a stand against activities that exploit wild animals and, ultimately, improve the creatures<U+2019> well-being. After all, dolphins and elephants held in captivity for entertainment purposes can suffer severe physical and psychological damage, according to various animal rights groups. Says Stephanie Shaw, a corporate liaison for PETA: <U+201C>TripAdvisor is a leader in the industry and we understand and applaud that this is a precedent-setting move.<U+201D> The NY Times reports that the site will also launch an education portal to help educate travelers about animal-welfare concerns and why they shouldn<U+2019>t be disappointed about not being offered a chance to visit with wild animals. As True Activist has mentioned in the past, the processes required to <U+2018>tame<U+2019> wild animals are often barbaric and cruel to the beasts involved, which is why they should not be supported by those who are advocates for equality. Read more about how elephants<U+2019> spirits are <U+201C>broken<U+201D> here . <U+201C>We believe the end result of our efforts will be enabling travelers to make more thoughtful choices about whether to visit an animal attraction and to write more meaningful reviews about those attractions,<U+201D> says TripAdvisor<U+2019>s chief executive and co-founder, Stephen Kaufer. The site will stop selling tickets to some attractions immediately, but the majority of booking policy changes will be implemented in early 2017. The company says that there will also be an appeals process for the hundreds of affected attractions should they be able to prove they are within the new policy. If you<U+2019>re an avid traveler and are an advocate for the animals, you have one more reason to support TripAdvisor. In the past, the conscious agency has prohibited listing or posting reviews of blood sports such as bullfights and canned hunts. What are your thoughts?

Hillary Clinton is probably guilty of many things which have not surfaced as openly or as clearly, but Hillary is guilty as sin of malfeasance of office and negligence, for the very fact that she exposed her country<U+2019>s secrets to hackers, knowingly using a <U+201C>private server<U+201D> to conduct State Department business with the outside world and should be called to account for it.

Weiner. \nThe F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case <U+2014> one federal official said they numbered in the thousands <U+2014> potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election. \nFBI Director James Comey referenced these emails in his letter to Congress announcing that the Clinton case had been reopened: <U+201C>In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.<U+201D> \nComey wrote that while it was unclear how long it would take to conduct the investigation in light of the new information or whether or not it would prove to be <U+201C>significant,<U+201D> he wanted to inform Congress of the development. He added: \nIn previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton<U+2019>s personal email server.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Dave Reilly \n source: counterpunch.org \n text: Email \nTo view photojournalist Orin Langelle<U+2019>s new online photography exhibit If Voting Changed Things is to accept a challenge. Don<U+2019>t expect a passive viewing of simple, aesthetically pleasing photography or a mindless stroll through apolitical eye candy. The challenge should be apparent from the title of the exhibit: It is a riddle, a fragment, an incomplete sentence awaiting your contribution. To view his display is to realize that there is no single way to finish the statement. Langelle invites you to see the complexity of the world through his lens, but to draw your own conclusions about the meaning of the images. \nIf Voting Changed Things<U+2026> people would vote. They don<U+2019>t. Only 58% of eligible voters did in the last presidential election. Recent polls indicate that the majority of Americans feel disenfranchised by the 2016 presidential election process and candidates. They aren<U+2019>t proud or hopeful about the outcome, and half of Americans feel helpless. There is no emphasis on issues that matter to them. Election discussion centers around voting for the least worst candidate, which makes civic duty seem like an exercise in self-denial and a concession that our aspirations are not achievable. \nOf course, the counter is that if you don<U+2019>t vote, you<U+2019>re giving someone else the power to make decisions for you. But that perspective ignores the range of opportunities for civic engagement and citizen action: Protesting, demonstrating, picketing, civil disobedience, rallies, striking, tax resistance, boycotting, sit-ins, sabotage, hacking and DDoS, tree-sitting, resistance, law-breaking, insurrection, rebellion, revolution. Langelle<U+2019>s images of protest activity outside of national conventions in 1972 and 2004 raise the question of whether voting, and the electoral circus that accompanies it, is about citizen empowerment or an explicit and ceremonial abdication of power by citizens to a status quo elite. Which leads to the observation that<U+2026> \nIf Voting Changed Things<U+2026> they wouldn<U+2019>t let us do it. Chomsky wrote that <U+201C>The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum<U+2014>even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there<U+2019>s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of debate.<U+201D> Photographs from 1972 and 2004 capture moments outside of the system, beyond the framing of the acceptable discourse. Protesters explicitly reject governmental authority through symbols, slogans, caricatures, and artwork. The elephant pulling a coffin through Miami<U+2019>s city streets conveys a belief that political parties are leading us to death and destruction. The black hoods and orange jump suits communicate that protesters in Boston, relegated to a <U+201C>Free Speech Zone,<U+201D> have become the equivalent of Guantanamo Bay detained terrorist suspects. It is not accidental that the media ignores or minimalizes these displays of collective action. In 2016 delegates<U+2014>the people who were there (never mind viewers at home)<U+2014>at the Republican and Democratic National Conventions remarked that they were unaware that protests were occurring outside throughout. Langelle deftly illustrates that this is because authorities have increasingly managed and marginalized protest behavior. Which demonstrates that<U+2026> \nIf Voting Changed Things <U+2026> this exhibit wouldn<U+2019>t be necessary. For many, Langelle<U+2019>s work will be shocking because it lays bare the evolution of policing and the criminalization of dissent. Photos of the 1972 demonstrations include arson, sabotage, gratuitous nudity, and graffiti that challenges, <U+201C>Amerika<U+2014>Love it or Destroy it,<U+201D> and yet not a single police officer is identifiable among the activists. The activists are in the streets, climbing in trees, occupying fields and grassy lawns, neighborhoods and parks. Contrast this with images of Boston Police in 2004, appearing ready for war in riot gear; armed with Tasers, guns, clubs; a menacing and ubiquitous presence atop scaffolding towers. Because of new draconian laws, protesters have been herded into holding pens of chain link fences and razor wire, surrounded by surveillance cameras, concrete, and girders. The photos depict a world that has changed drastically in thirty years, and which has militarized against, marginalized, and narrowly framed the acceptable boundaries of citizen dissent. Moreover<U+2026> \nIf Voting Changed Things <U+2026> it wouldn<U+2019>t contrast so distinctly with other forms of citizen action. There is a humor and a vibrancy to <U+201C>the people<U+201D> that Langelle juxtaposes brilliantly against the sterile and colorless state apparatus. There is a diversity of skin color, age, gender among the protesters. Their slogans are racy, their clothing is colorful and fun. They wield musical instruments, engage in <U+201C>guerilla theatre<U+201D> and share poetry. They engage in property destruction with irony<U+2014>wearing clogs as they break windows and asking through their graffitti with (gallows) humor if the protest restraint area represents the <U+201C>Land of the Free?<U+201D> Their defiance comes in the form of patches, to be worn on the derriere, sold by a young girl in a flowered dress. They paint their faces and wear straw hats. \nThe stark reality of the state is helmeted, with dark gray protective gear and weapons to enforce compliance. The only colors are the red, white, and blue banners and flags that appear more as a hypocritical challenge to the popular movements than a patriotic display. It is evident that Langelle sees a dour system that is oppressive and lifeless. Voting is a part of that system, a reinforcement of its values and an affirmation of the status quo. \nIf Voting Changed Things<U+2026> marginalized groups wouldn<U+2019>t be in the streets. The electoral process in America has produced and validated a government that has produced institutional racism, militarization within and from our society, mass incarceration, crippling debt, perpetual war, homelessness, a failed health care system, eroding and ineffective education, and environmental exploitation. If Voting Changed Things<U+2026> we wouldn<U+2019>t have a 1%. We wouldn<U+2019>t allow the .01%, 16,000 Americans , to hold as much wealth ($9 trillion) as 80 percent of the nation<U+2019>s population <U+2013> some 256,000,000 people <U+2013> and as much as 75 percent of the entire world<U+2019>s population. We wouldn<U+2019>t allow the five largest white landowners in America to own more agricultural land than all of black America. If Voting Changed Things<U+2026> demographics wouldn<U+2019>t be used as a basis for electoral strategies. We would vote away the cleavages that exist across generations, racial and cultural groups, religious affiliations. But we don<U+2019>t, because we can<U+2019>t. \nIf Voting Changed Things<U+2026> would we be where we are? The work of Orin Langelle may offer you a lens from which to answer that question. Or to find your own conclusion to the sentence. \nIf Voting Changed Things can be viewed online at: If Voting Changed Things: Exhibit Online . It is also on display at the <U+00A1>Buen Vivir! Gallery for Contemporary Art in Buffalo, NY until December 2 nd . \nDave Reilly is professor and chair of political science and director of international studies at Niagara University in Lewiston, New York, where he serves as president of the faculty union and moderator for the Black Student Union.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Alex Frangos \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-and-chinas-currency-a-dangerous-relationship-for-markets-1478855672 \n text: Donald Trump <U+2019>s enmity toward the Chinese currency isn<U+2019>t directly responsible for the yuan hitting its weakest point against the dollar in six years on Friday. But it sure could matter how China chooses to manage it going forward. Beijing set the yuan<U+2019>s midpoint Friday at 6.81 to the dollar, while the freely traded offshore variant touched 6.83 around the same level at which it was pegged from 2008 to 2010 . For Mr. Trump, who accuses China of keeping its currency artificially low, such a move could even appear as a subtle welcome message. There were, however, good, technical reasons for China<U+2019>s central bank to set the currency weaker on Friday. Though its decision making remains less than crystal clear , we know it is influenced by how other currencies trade in a basket against the yuan. The dollar is the biggest part of the basket and its strength, along with yen and euro weakness, argued for the move lower, which anyway has been the yuan<U+2019>s direction of travel for over a year. While economists broadly agreed that it was too strong for a number of years, that is no longer the case . Simply look at market forces: Chinese are trying hard to get their money out of the country . To prevent the yuan from plummeting, Beijing spent $136 billion in reserves last quarter on a balance of payments basis. China probably couldn<U+2019>t meaningfully strengthen the yuan even if it tried. The more important question is whether it can stop the yuan from falling even faster. On that point, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s policies will matter greatly. Right now, China sees it in its own interests to block the yuan from falling quickly. It engenders stability domestically, preventing an even faster exodus of cash from the economy. It also helps relations with the U.S., which has gently pestered China for years to keep the currency strong. A combative relationship with the U.S. , as foreshadowed in Mr. Trump<U+2019>s threat of imposing tariffs as soon as he takes office , could push China to decide its greater interest is actually letting the yuan find a bottom quickly. Such a snap depreciation<U+2014>analysts guess it could fall 10% or more in a day<U+2014>would, after the dust settles, create an equilibrium on outflows, stimulate exports and preserve China<U+2019>s reserves for another time. But in the process, it would upend global markets that have grown accustomed to China<U+2019>s current currency path. Mr. Trump may push for China to strengthen its currency, but the result may be that it gets even weaker. Write to Alex Frangos at alex.frangos@wsj.com",

People were bemoaning him as a fascist and no one in the mainstream wanted to admit that our election process is entirely rigged . The trouble is, voter fraud on a grand scale can be tough to prove . \nAs it turns out, voter fraud on a smaller scale has been detected in 6 locations already, according to today<U+2019>s Drudge Report . But don<U+2019>t worry. These are just <U+201C>glitches<U+201D> or <U+201C>too few to make a difference.<U+201D> 1) Chicago \nIn the Windy City, the dead have been voting for decades. Two investigators have admitted finding proof of this, but they refuse to say that there is fraud. Relatives of the Voting Dead feel differently. They say that they<U+2019>ve reported the deaths of their loved ones repeatedly, but that the names have not been removed from the rolls. But that isn<U+2019>t the worst of it <U+2013> not only are these people on the rolls <U+2013> they<U+2019>ve repeatedly voted since their deaths. \nDon<U+2019>t worry, though. It<U+2019>s just a few hundred dead voters that they<U+2019>ve been able to confirm. No biggie. ( source ) 2) Philadelphia \nChicago is not alone with the dead folks voting.There are also reports from Philadelphia that people are making their voices heard from beyond the grave. *cough* Local station Action News 6 investigated and found that a stunning number of people have been deemed <U+201C>active voters<U+201D> for many years since their deaths. \nDon<U+2019>t worry, though. The local voting board says these mistakes are simply <U+201C>human error<U+201D> and that there aren<U+2019>t enough dead voters to actually sway the election. ( source ) 3) Hollywood, Maryland \nA woman in Maryland has reported another incidence of <U+201C>vote flipping.<U+201D> She voted a straight Republican ticket, then checked after it was submitted. Her vote for Trump had been switched to a vote for Clinton. \nDon<U+2019>t worry, though. The election officials there told her to just vote again. Of course, this would <U+201C>undo<U+201D> the vote for Clinton, but would it really count as a vote for Trump? I<U+2019>m sure it<U+2019>s fine. The election officials would want to be scrupulous about something like that. ( source ) 4) Miami-Dade County, Florida \nTwo women have been charged with felony counts of tampering with the election. One, a temporary election worker, was caught marking ballots by her co-workers. The other was caught filling out voter registration paperwork for people who did not exist. \nDon<U+2019>t worry, though. These were isolated incidents that have been dealt with. In the words of State Attorney Katherine Fern<U+00E1>ndez Rundle, a Democrat, <U+201C>Anyone who attempts to undermine the democratic process should recognize that there is an enforcement partnership between the elections department and our prosecution task force in place to thwart such efforts and arrest those involved. Now we need to move forward with the election.<U+201D> ( source ) 5) Alexandria, Virginia \nA guy in Virginia who was formerly employed by the New Virginia Majority, an advocacy group aligned with the Democratic party, was caught using fake names to fill out voter registration applications. \nBut don<U+2019>t worry. Commonwealth Attorney Bryan Porter said, <U+201C>Since the fraudulent applications involved fictitious people, had the fraud not been uncovered the risk of actual fraudulent votes being cast was low.<U+201D> ( source ) 6) Lots of places in Texas \nMuch like the report in Maryland, voters in various locations in Texas have reported that when they chose a straight Republican ticket, the voting machines opted for Clinton/Kaine instead of Trump/Pence . Voters in Amarillo, Arlington, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Cypress, Mesquite, and El Paso have all reported vote flipping from Trump to Clinton. \nBut don<U+2019>t worry. Election officials in the state say it<U+2019>s not a problem with the equipment . It<U+2019>s just those silly voters who don<U+2019>t know how to use it. <U+201C><U+201C>Typically, we<U+2019>ve found it<U+2019>s voter error with the equipment.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Beth Reinhard Janet Hook \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-makes-a-push-in-florida-1477274227 \n text: As Donald Trump <U+2019>s path to the presidency appears to narrow, the GOP nominee<U+00A0>on Sunday<U+00A0>hunkered down in Florida, one of a handful of swing states that polls suggest remain competitive. Mr. Trump is slated to headline five rallies over three days in the nation<U+2019>s largest battleground, where more than a million voters have already mailed in ballots. In-person early voting begins Monday. In one potentially ominous sign for Mr. Trump, Democrats are holding their own against Republicans in mail-in ballots in Florida, a mode of voting that the GOP traditionally dominates, according to University of Florida political-science professor Daniel A. Smith. The state reports the party affiliation of people sending back ballots. The more traction Democrats gain in early voting, the harder it will be for Mr. Trump to catch up, even if polls narrow near Election Day. At a rally Sunday in the heavily Republican retirement community of Naples, Mr. Trump said his campaign in Florida looks <U+201C>phenomenal.<U+201D> He also said polls around the country are underestimating his support among women. <U+201C>We are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win back the White House,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said in a county where Republicans outnumber Democrats by a 2-to-1 ratio. <U+201C>There is the same enthusiasm all over the country. They<U+2019>ve never seen anything like it.<U+201D> Polls show a number of pivotal states slipping away from Mr. Trump, with the exception of Iowa, where he still leads Democrat Hillary Clinton. The race remains tight in the hot spots of Ohio, North Carolina and Nevada, where a Las Vegas newspaper owned by casino billionaire<U+00A0>and Trump donor Sheldon Adelson, endorsed the GOP nominee<U+2014>a rare nod from the press at a time when even many conservative editorial boards have rejected him. Surveys also show<U+00A0>closer-than-expected<U+00A0>races in traditionally reliably Republican states, including Arizona, Georgia and Utah. In Texas, last carried by a Democrat in 1976, Mrs. Clinton is trailing by only 3 points, according to a new CBS News Battleground Tracker poll<U+2014>though other polls show Mr. Trump ahead there by 5 to 8 percentage points. <U+201C>We are behind,<U+201D> Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Sunday on NBC, citing Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s $66 million in ads in September and a team of high-powered surrogates. <U+201C>She<U+2019>s seen as the incumbent. So our advantage going in when we<U+2019>re behind<U+2026>is that Donald Trump is just going to continue to take the case directly to the people.<U+201D> Mr. Trump will appear in northern and central parts of Florida<U+00A0>on Monday<U+00A0>and<U+00A0>Tuesday, while the Clinton campaign seeks to drive up turnout in the more liberal southern region. Mrs. Clinton is planning a rally<U+00A0>Tuesday<U+00A0>in Broward County<U+2014>which hosts more Democrats than any other Florida county<U+2014>two days after an appearance there by her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine is scheduled to campaign<U+00A0>Monday<U+00A0>in neighboring Miami-Dade County. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s challenges are compounded by new signs of GOP disunity. At Sunday<U+2019>s Florida rally, Mr. Trump thanked the crowd for <U+201C>helping me re-elect Republicans all over the place<U+201D><U+2014>but he didn't mention Sen. Marco Rubio, a former rival for the GOP nomination seeking re-election. Mr. Rubio has declined to campaign with Mr. Trump. The feud between Mr. Trump and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin intensified<U+00A0>Saturday<U+00A0>when an article attacking the House Speaker appeared on the conservative website Breitbart.com, which was run by Trump adviser Steve Bannon before he joined the campaign. The article accused Mr. Ryan of trying to sabotage the Trump campaign and of being in league with the former secretary of state on <U+201C>globalist<U+201D> policies. <U+201C>This is utter crazy talk,<U+201D> said Ryan spokesman Zack Roday.<U+00A0><U+201C>Speaker Ryan<U+2019>s focus is on beating Democrats, including Secretary Clinton.<U+201D> Mr. Ryan said recently he would no longer defend or campaign with Mr. Trump, while a number of other prominent Republicans outright pulled endorsements of the party<U+2019>s nominee. The mutiny followed the disclosure of an 11-year-old videotape of Mr. Trump boasting that his star power allowed him to make unwanted sexual advances and number of women coming forward to say he did just that. A gay Republican PAC<U+00A0>on Saturday<U+00A0>withheld its endorsement of the party<U+2019>s nominee for the first time since 2004, when President George W. Bush backed a constitutional amendment outlawing same-sex marriage in his re-election campaign. The president of the Log Cabin Republicans, Gregory T. Angelo, cited Mr. Trump<U+2019>s proposed ban on Muslim refugees and the multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against him. <U+201C>The mission of the Log Cabin Republicans is to support equality for all Americans, and that means all Americans, writ large,<U+201D> Mr. Angelo said. Since the third presidential debate, Mr. Trump has also taken heat for refusing to commit to accepting the results of the election if he loses. He has said he was just reserving the right to challenge the result if it is close or tainted by voter fraud. Critics said his unfounded accusations are damaging confidence in the electoral system. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s rigged. It<U+2019>s broken. It<U+2019>s corrupt,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said Sunday in Florida. <U+201C>They want me to take that back.<U+201D> Republican Party Chairman Reince<U+00A0>Priebus<U+00A0>earlier on Sunday<U+00A0>played down charges that the election is rigged, saying the party will be <U+201C>reasonable<U+201D> in assessing the results of the<U+00A0>Nov. 8<U+00A0>vote. <U+201C>Losing by a hundred votes is one thing,<U+201D> Mr.<U+00A0>Priebus<U+00A0>said on<U+00A0>CBS<U+2019>s Face the Nation. <U+201C>Losing by 100,000 is a different thing. I think we can be reasonable on this issue.<U+201D> Mr. Trump<U+2019>s son Eric sounded a similar note on ABC<U+2019>s This Week, saying: <U+201C>Listen, if it<U+2019>s a fair outcome, he will absolutely accept it<U+2026>There<U+2019>s no question about it.<U+201D> Mr. Trump made a symbolic trip<U+00A0>Saturday<U+00A0>to the storied battlefield of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. The campaign billed the speech as his closing argument and agenda for his first 100 days in office, but that message was overshadowed by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s threats to sue the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. <U+201C>All of these liars will be sued after the election is over,<U+201D> he said. He also stepped up his attacks on the media by assailing the proposed merger of AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc., as well as the 2011 merger of Comcast Corp. and General Electric Co. <U+2019>s NBCUniversal. On his first day in office, the New York businessman said he would propose term limits on members of Congress, a hiring freeze at some federal agencies, new restrictions on lobbying by former government officials and new limits on regulations by requiring that for every new federal rule issued, two existing regulations be eliminated. He said he would immediately implement his trade agenda by announcing plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Asia trade pact, and ask the Treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator. He also would suspend immigration from nations he considers <U+201C>terror prone<U+201D> and deport criminal illegal immigrants. His first-100-days legislative agenda would include repealing the Obamacare health law, tax cuts and his immigration plan. Among the new details mentioned by Mr. Trump were mandatory minimum prison sentences for those illegally re-entering the U.S. after deportation. In a Twitter post Sunday, Mr. Trump, using his rallying cry to clean up Washington, D.C., wrote: <U+201C>It is time to<U+00A0>#DrainTheSwamp<U+2014>this is our last chance!<U+201D> <U+2014>Kate Davidson contributed to this article.

But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.'\nClinton has also been criticized over claims that the Clinton Foundation receives funding from Saudi and Qatari sources.\nLater in the 25-minute interview, which will be broadcast on Russia Today, Assange claims next Tuesday's presidential election has been fixed in favour of Hillary Clinton.\nHe added: 'My analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment. Banks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves.'\nDonald Trump has repeatedly said Tuesday's presidential election may be rigged, while providing scant evidence, and has urged supporters to keep an eye out for signs of voting fraud in Philadelphia and other heavily Democratic areas.\nDemocrats worry that could encourage Trump supporters to harass minority voters in a state that could determine whether Trump or his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, wins the presidency. Voting-rights advocates said they are already receiving reports of harassment.\nDemocrats have launched a legal blitz of their own in an attempt to shut down Trump's poll-watching efforts in Pennsylvania and three other battleground states, arguing in lawsuits that Republican monitoring efforts amount to 'vigilante voter intimidation' that violates federal law.\nAssange earlier denied he was a stooge for the Russian intelligence services, claiming they were not behind the damaging leaks to the Clinton campaign.\nHe has been wanted by Swedish authorities since 2010 over rape allegations.\nHe has been hiding the the Ecuadorian embassy in London over fears he will be extradited to the United States.\nHe said: 'The Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything.\n'Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That's false <U+0096> we can say that the Russian government is not the source.'\nThe first tranche of emails published by WikiLeaks claimed the Democratic party leadership actively favored Clinton over her rival for the nomination Bernie Sanders.\nThe Department of Homeland Security Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said last month they were 'confident' the Russian government was responsible for the leaks.\nBut Russia has denied this and presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov said it was 'nonsense'.\nIn an interview with veteran John Pilger on RT, Assange said: 'We have independently authenticated the emails. WikiLeaks has a decade-long, perfect record in the accurate authentication of leaked documents.'

But he<U+2019>s blinded by his own hubris when he blames it on Republicans. Democratic leadership has never indicated any agreement to <U+201C>improve<U+201D> Dodd-Frank or ObamaCare with anything other than more rules and regulations in the case of Dodd-Frank and a government single-payer system in the case of ObamaCare. Notice how even blinded liberals, like the good professor, refer to it as ObamaCare now because the actual name for the comprehensive <U+201C>Affordable Care Act<U+201D> is a laughable oxymoron. It<U+2019>s neither comprehensive nor affordable. I<U+2019>m no fan of Donald Trump, but ideologically I<U+2019>m tired of limousine liberals telling me that when Republicans disagree with something, they are obstructionist, but when liberal Democrats disagree and cause the same obstruction (think recent Zika legislation), they are <U+201C>principled.<U+201D> Both parties are guilty, and that is what has caused the Trump phenomenon. Larry Thomas North Hampton, N.H. Prof. Blinder seems not to understand that our Constitution creates political gridlock when Americans are divided. This isn<U+2019>t political dysfunction, but rather a roadblock to dictatorship. Steven Martin Richardson, Texas There are other reasons why many are discouraged. Look at our current foreign policy and our standing in the world. Our actions and inactions have caused problems with Russia, China and Iran and in places like Syria and Iraq. ISIS has proved more than a <U+201C>JV team.<U+201D> Appeasement has made the world a more dangerous place. Charles Coleman Larchmont, N.Y. The evils of political gridlock are in the eye of the beholder. Mr. Obama was elected with a filibuster-proof Congress. Instead of following his campaign promises, he rammed ObamaCare down our throats. The voters quickly denied him the House of Representatives. Instead of resorting to bipartisan efforts, he changed tactics, attempting to rule rather than govern. What America sees, to its dismay, is a deliberate attempt to divide us, not unite us. We recognize we are being manipulated by the progressive movement through the media, through illegal and immoral regulatory agencies, backdoor government deals and a movement that believes the ends<U+2014>victory<U+2014>justify the means. We know that we are and can be better than this. Jim Barber Mesa, Ariz. Prof. Blinder fails to mention that ObamaCare was passed by Democrats using an arcane political maneuver called reconciliation<U+2014>a tactic to resolve minor differences among the two houses. Reconciliation was never intended to be used as a blunt cudgel to obviate the traditional democratic process of straight-up votes. No significant legislation in Congress has ever been both successful and accepted by the nation without at least some opposition party members voting aye. The Democrats short-circuited the process of compromise, and the result is that ObamaCare has never been palatable to a significant number of Americans. Robert Landis New Rochelle, N.Y. My neighbors and I believe the country is on the wrong track because we see an ever-expanding federal government despite the Tenth Amendment, a corrupt IRS and regulatory agencies which act as kings and dictators rather than as servants of the people. We see a country that is $20 trillion in debt, an economy that is growing at, maybe, 2% a year, family and friends who haven<U+2019>t been able to find jobs for so long they<U+2019>re no longer counted as unemployed and future liabilities for Social Security and Medicare that cannot be met.

U.S. District Judge Gerald Pappert rejected claims by the state Republican party that it was harmed by Pennsylvania<U+2019>s requirement that poll watchers can serve only in their home counties. Poll watching has become a highly charged issue in the 2016 election. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned the fairness of the election process, while Democrats have accused Republicans and the Trump campaign of seeking to intimidate voters. The controversy has been acute in Pennsylvania, a battleground state.<U+00A0> Months ago the Trump campaign identified Philadelphia as among the urban <U+201C>hot spots<U+201D> it planned to monitor closely. In stump speeches, Mr. Trump has urged supporters <U+201C>to go out and watch<U+201D> for fraud. In response, Pennsylvania Democrats filed a federal lawsuit this week seeking to block Republicans from harassing or intimidating voters.<U+00A0>That case is separate from the one that produced Thursday<U+2019>s ruling. In the decision, Judge Pappert chided Republicans for bringing the lawsuit so close to Election Day.<U+00A0> Allowing poll watchers to roam the state <U+201C>could result in certain counties being inundated with prospective poll watchers seeking credentials<U+201D> with less than a week to go, he said. The judge also said the state GOP<U+2019>s <U+201C>preoccupation<U+201D> with poll watching disregarded other mechanisms the state had in place to prevent voter fraud. Even in Democratic strongholds like Philadelphia County, there is no shortage of Republican voters who would be eligible to monitor polls in their communities, the judge said. A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Republican Party didn<U+2019>t immediately respond to a request for comment. <U+201C>We were confident that a court would reject the Republican Party<U+2019>s egregious attempt to cause chaos and disruption on Election Day, and we are pleased with the ruling,<U+201D> said Jeff Sheridan, a spokesman for Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com",

Italy was among the nations voting in favor of the resolution. \nIsrael blasted UNESCO and its Arab members for trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site. \nKara arrived in the Vatican in a fruitless effort to avert the resolution, but still managed to have a small chat with the leader of the Catholic Church. \nAccording to Kara, Pope Francis <U+00E2><U+0080><U+009C>strongly disagreed<U+00E2><U+0080><U+009D> with the resolution. \n<U+00E2><U+0080><U+009C>He (the Pope) even said publicly that the holy land is connected to the Nation of Israel,<U+00E2><U+0080><U+009D> the deputy minister stressed. \nYeah, he<U+2019>s not a good Pope. \nOur model Pope is Urban II, who just wanted to exterminate all non-Whites in the Holy Land, Jew or Moslem. \nDo the Jews not know that people are paying attention to these types of statements now? \nIf so, why do they keep making them? If you ever see a Jew covering his door frame with sheeps blood, it should definitely be a cause for concern. \nEven if this Jew believes Yahweh did the earthquake as revenge, why would he state it publicly? Italy is not a Jew country and presumably does not believe in the magic powers of the Jewish god. \nSo what is the point of making this statement, which can only serve to make the Jews and their god appear hostile, violent, hateful and evil?",

Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , <U+201C>voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere.<U+201D> Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. \nMany officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News <U+2026> \nSeveral schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. \nThe fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. \n<U+201C>If anybody can sit there and say they don<U+2019>t think this is a contentious election, then they aren<U+2019>t paying much attention,<U+201D> Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. \nAnd without a doubt, voting locations are <U+201C>soft targets<U+201D> that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters <U+2026> \n<U+201C>There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didn<U+2019>t have 15 or 20 years ago,<U+201D> said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. <U+201C> What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then that<U+2019>s certainly concerning.<U+201D> \nAll it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. \nLet us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. \nAnother reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania <U+2026> \n<U+201C>We don<U+2019>t want to lose an election because you know what I<U+2019>m talking about,<U+201D> Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. <U+201C>Because you know what? That<U+2019>s a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places .<U+201D> \nAnd of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats<U+2026> \nEarly voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. \nRepublican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. \n<U+201C>I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent,<U+201D> Moynihan said. <U+201C>You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat.<U+201D> \nIn addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . \nWell, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation <U+2026> \nAccording to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. \nThe McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation <U+2013> apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 <U+2013> when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? \nEither way, it doesn<U+2019>t look good. \nAfter everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. \nBut Democrats don<U+2019>t like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters<U+2026> \n<U+201C>It<U+2019>s un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that ,<U+201D> Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book <U+201C> Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America ,<U+201D> previously told The Christian Science Monitor. <U+201C>Voting was very, very dangerous. I don<U+2019>t think anyone<U+2019>s suggesting that we<U+2019>re at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic.<U+201D> \nWithout a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. \nBut will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? \nIf that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed.

        "input": "time: null \n author: The European Union Times \n source: eutimes.net \n text: \nA sobering new Security Council ( SC ) analytical report on the US presidential election states that a new American Revolution has begun which today<U+2019>s popular vote is just the beginning of; and that could fully last up to an entire decade, especially if this election is stolen from Donald Trump. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\nAccording to this report, Federation intelligence analysts in their <U+201C>deciphering/uncovering<U+201D> what the current US presidential election is really all about have heavily relied on <U+201C>outliers<U+201D> [a thing situated away or detached from the main body or system] such as artificial intelligence ( AI ) models, social media trends and psychological analysis of the American electorate.\nThis report notes that the Security Councils use of these <U+201C>outliers<U+201D> to both understand and explain what is occurring during this US presidential election provides the only proven scientific evidence of what is occurring as the so called polling data used by the American propaganda media has been proven to be nothing more than a manipulation device used to keep people from voting for or supporting the anti-establishment candidate Donald Trump.\nExamples of this being true, this report explains, lie in too many examples to fully cite<U+2014>but includes the once respected Monmouth University poll found manipulating data to favor Hillary Clinton , news networks NBC and CBS found manipulating polling data to show Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump when she was actually losing , and CNN manipulating their poll data to favor Hillary Clinton too .\nUnlike manipulated polling data showing Hillary Clinton will win this election, however, this report continues, the objective and independent scientific <U+201C>outliers<U+201D> used by Security Council research analysts show not only Donald Trump winning<U+2014>but winning in a landslide victory.\nEvidence proving this assertion of a Donald Trump US presidential win, this report notes, lies first with artificial intelligence analysis<U+2014>that includes the MogIA supercomputer showing Trump winning in landslide and showing he is more popular than President Obama , and a just released AI computer simulation showing Trump winning with 289 electoral votes compared to Clinton<U+2019>s 249 .\nSocial media trend lines in this election, likewise, proves a Donald Trump landslide win in this election, this report continues, as his Facebook-Twitter-Instagram-YouTube <U+201C>presence<U+201D> dwarfs Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s by a staggering 74 million <U+2014>and that is further validated by the over 700,000 Americans who have come to his campaign rallies, as opposed to the barely 60,000 that have attended Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s .\nMost fascinating though of the <U+201C>outliers<U+201D> used in this Security Council report is the psychological analysis of the American electorate conducted by a virtually unknown US political project called <U+201C> We Need Smith <U+201D><U+2014>whose scientifically conducted studies shockingly proved that anyone from a liberal Democrat, to a conservative Republican was able to win the US presidency as long as they promised to destroy the corrupt political system currently ruling America .\nThe <U+201C>We Need Smith<U+201D> project, this report explains, is named after a popular US Great Depression era movie called Mr. Smith Goes To Washington about a newly appointed United States Senator who fights against a corrupt political system<U+2014>and that during this present US presidential election only Donald Trump and US Senator Bernie Sanders fit the mold of.\nCritical to note about the <U+201C>We Need Smith<U+201D> project too, this report continues, is that it was co-founded by the legendary American pollster Patrick Caddell <U+2014>who almost singlehandedly was responsible for putting President Jimmy Carter in office in 1976, but also presided over Carter<U+2019>s unprecedented defeat in 1980 at the hands of the US establishments most hated candidate Ronald Reagan.\nSeeking to understand how President Carter could go from victory to defeat in just 4 years, this report details, Patrick Caddell spent the past nearly 4 decades examining it<U+2014>and coming to the scientific conclusion that the conventional wisdom that America is absolutely divided into warring tribes is simply not true, they are all just tired of being lied to .\nIn fact, this report continues, Caddell<U+2019>s research proved that the American political battleground is no longer over ideology but instead is all about insurgency<U+2014>and with a staggering 84% of the American public believing that the elites live by a different set of rules and laws than ordinary people do , anyone running against them is assured victory.\nInterestingly to note too, this report says, is Caddell<U+2019>s scientific analyses showing that the hatred of the American people towards their elites comes from both the left and right <U+2014>and as evidenced by the equal explosive political movements known as Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party insurgencies .\nThis report grimly concludes, however, with a warning that Soviet Communist leader Joseph Stalin<U+2019>s attributed statement<U+2014><U+201C> Those who cast the votes decide nothing. Those who count the votes decide everything. <U+201D><U+2014>may, indeed, be active in the present US presidential election after newly released secret documents revealed that Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s main supporter, multi-billionaire George Soros, has not only been manipulating the entire American election system , but one of his companies is, also, providing vote county software to 16 States ( they<U+2019>ve since denied )<U+2014>and that should Donald Trump have this election stolen from him the people of that nation will most surely revolt.\nSource \n",

Recipient Name Recipient Email => \nA Syrian Kurdish and Arab force backed by US air strikes has launched an offensive against the Islamic State<U+2019>s de facto Syrian capital at Raqqa aimed at maximising pressure on Isis when it is already under attack in Mosul in Iraq. Anti-Isis forces advanced six miles in the first four hours of the attack, capturing many villages and farms. \nThe move against Raqqa, a city of 320,000 people on the Euphrates River, is by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) which numbers about 30,000 fighters, of whom 20,000 are seasoned Kurdish fighters and 10,000 are drawn from the Sunni Arab population of northern Syria. The US is keen not to provoke Turkey which has denounced the Syrian Kurdish People<U+2019>s Protection Units (YPG) as terrorists. \nUS officers say that one reason for seeking to isolate and capture Raqqa now is that it is at the centre of planning and execution of Isis terrorist operations against Europe, the US and the wider world and they fear such an operation is about to be launched. General Stephen Townsend, the US commander of Operation Inherent Resolve, which is aimed at eliminating Isis, said last week that <U+201C>we know they<U+2019>re up to something. And it<U+2019>s an external plot; we don<U+2019>t know exactly where; we don<U+2019>t know exactly when.<U+201D> He added that this uncertainty was creating <U+201C>a sense of urgency.<U+201D> \nIt would be keeping with Isis<U+2019> actions in the past that it seeks to counter-balance setbacks on the battlefield in Iraq and Syria by staging spectacular terrorist atrocities abroad that show that it is still to be feared and can strike when and where it wants. It carried out two suicide bombings in Iraq on Sunday killing 25 people and wounding 50 in the cities of Tikrit and Samarra. \nThe US-led war against the Caliphate declared after Isis captured Mosul in June 2014 has now reached a critical stage with Isis<U+2019>s many enemies closing in on all sides. Iraqi troops, whose offensive against Mosul started on 17 October, are meeting strong resistance in the east of the city with one unit surrounded and cut off for a time when Isis fighters appeared behind it. \nThe assault on Isis in both Syria and Iraq is very much orchestrated by the US and dependent on US-led airstrikes to destroy Isis positions. This may be more difficult to do as Iraqi army units move into Mosul which may have as many as 1.5 million people still in it. Some are seeking refuge behind the advancing government troops, but the numbers on the main road east of Mosul did not seem very large on Sunday, possibly because it is too dangerous for people to leave their houses and the Iraqi Army has told them to stay there. \nThe opening of the Raqqa offensive brings with its political complications that may exceed the military difficulties because Turkey does not want Raqqa to fall to a force dominated by the YPG, which is the Syrian arm of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has been fighting a guerrilla war against the Turkey Army since 1984. The US has been trying to avoid an armed confrontation between the YPG and Turkey or Turkish backed forces, a possibility that has grown since Turkey had its local allies seize Jarabulus and a strip of territory along the Syrian-Turkish border in August. \nThe mainly Kurdish SDF will be moving into a fertile area north of Raqqa where the population is Sunni Arab. There are doubts among the Syrian Kurds about suffering casualties trying to take an Arab city, which they cannot keep, when they would prefer to move west and link up their present swathe of territory with the Kurdish enclave at Afrin further west, but this is being resisted by Turkey. The Syrian Kurds are doing what the US wants because their future is very dependent on US military and political support. The SDF said it had received weapons from the US, including anti-tank missiles, and some 50 US advisers are reported to be accompanying the advance to call in airstrikes. \nThe SDF spokesman Talal Sillo was quoted as saying that <U+201C>we want to liberate the surrounding countryside, then encircle the city, then we will assault and liberate it,<U+201D> he said. Asked about the possibility of intervention by Turkey or its local allies, he replied: <U+201C>Of course, to begin the operation, we have made sure there will be no other forces but the SDF in the operation.<U+201D> \nUnderlining the complexity of the present situation, an SDF official, Rezan Hiddo, said Turkey has been an <U+201C>obstacle<U+201D> to the Raqqa campaign all along. He said that if Turkey moves against Kurdish areas in northern Syria then the Kurds would stop their campaign directed at Raqqa, adding: <U+201C>we cannot extinguish the fire in our neighbours<U+2019> house if our home is burning.<U+201D> \nIsis is using its traditional mixture of suicide car bombs, snipers, booby traps and Improvised Explosive Devices, but these no longer create the terror they once did. Counter-measures are more effective. Major General Maan al-Sadi told Iraqi state television that Isis fighters had launched more than 100 car bombs against his forces in east Mosul, which is only one of the fronts in the fighting. A Counter Terrorism unit came under attack from the rear after advancing into east Mosul, when Isis fighters emerged from houses behind them and isolated the convoy, preventing reinforcements from getting through. Surrounded and low on ammunition, they had to shelter in houses before they finally got out on Saturday. He Isis news agency Amaq released footage on Sunday of captured or destroyed military vehicles, including the burnt wreckage of a Humvee it said was taken in the eastern district of Mosul. Fighters shouted <U+201C>Allahu Akbar (God is Greatest)<U+201D> and unloaded ammunition and communications equipment. (Reprinted from The Independent by permission of author or representative)",

Experts say the challenge<U+2014>besides the political popularity of tax breaks for mortgage interest and charitable contributions<U+2014>is that there isn<U+2019>t enough money there to accomplish his goal. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s just no way that restricting the deductions that Trump has talked about comes anywhere close to eliminating the tax cut for the wealthy in his plan,<U+201D> said Bill Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s just arithmetic.<U+201D> Steve Mnuchin, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s pick for Treasury secretary, said Wednesday that high-income households would get no absolute tax cut, a statement that is either imprecise or at odds with every analysis of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plan. Stephen Moore, who helped develop Mr. Trump<U+2019>s tax plan, said the proposal was designed so the deduction cap offsets the revenue loss from lowering the top tax rate on ordinary income from 39.6% to 33%. The idea is that high-income households would get no net tax advantage from that swap. But that approach means the deduction limits don<U+2019>t offset the tax cuts on business income, estates and capital gains, which all flow disproportionately to top earners. Tax cuts on capital gains, dividends, businesses and estates are especially skewed to the high end of the income and wealth distribution, said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a group that advocates for low-income families. <U+201C>You have all these other tax cuts that are disproportionately targeted to the wealthiest people in the country,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s the core element of the plan.<U+201D> Taxpayers under current law can itemize their deductions if they exceed the standard deduction, which this year is $6,300 for individuals and $12,600 for married couples. Most taxpayers don<U+2019>t exceed that threshold, and fewer than 30% are projected to itemize in 2017. The largest deductions are those for mortgage interest, charitable contributions and state and local taxes. Those three breaks alone total $200 billion in forgone revenue in 2017, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. Mr. Trump would squeeze deductions from both ends. He would more than double the standard deduction and limit itemized deductions to $100,000 for individuals and $200,000 for married couples. That deduction cap would raise about $559 billion over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center, a project of Brookings and the Urban Institute. Even with that cap, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plan would reduce government revenues by about $6.2 trillion over a decade. One thing that will become more apparent as Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plan moves through Congress is that the impact of deduction limits doesn<U+2019>t fall evenly. The state and local tax deduction tends to benefit residents of high-tax states such as California and New York. The mortgage interest deduction helps the upper middle class, especially in areas with high housing costs. More than 60% of<U+00A0>the tax break<U+00A0>goes to households between the 80th<U+00A0>and 99th<U+00A0>percentiles of income, according to the Tax Policy Center. And the charitable deduction helps the highest earners. According to Internal Revenue Service<U+00A0>data, the top 0.001%<U+2014>that is about 1,400 households<U+2014>reported 9.5% of charitable contributions. The focus on deductions ignores other tax benefits that high-income households get. They receive the bulk of capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at preferential rates. They also control the timing of those gains, deferring taxes for years and not paying anything as the value of their stocks and other assets appreciate. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plan is the latest attempt to curb deductions as part of a tax code overhaul.<U+00A0>The<U+00A0>House Republican plan<U+00A0>would eliminate the state and local tax deduction while preserving write-offs for mortgage interest and charity. President Barack Obama proposed a different idea. His plan would cap deductions and other tax breaks for top earners as if they were in the 28% bracket. That means a $1,000 deduction would be worth at most $280 in lower taxes, even if the taxpayer was in the 39.6% tax bracket. That plan went nowhere in Congress.

I think that was a big mistake,<U+201D> then-New York Senator Clinton told the Jewish Press, a New York-based weekly newspaper, several months after the January election. \n<U+201C>And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win,<U+201D> she said. \nUntil Friday, the comment Clinton made on September 5, 2006, only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist Eli Chomsky. An editor and a staff writer for the Jewish Press, he interviewed Clinton at the newspaper<U+2019>s office in Brooklyn. \nChomsky, who shared and played the tape for the Observer, says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with Clinton, during which the Palestinian parliamentary election was among top topics. The comments have been posted on SoundCloud. \nSpeaking to the news portal, he recalled being confused by the fact that <U+201C>anyone could support the idea <U+2014> offered by a national political leader, no less <U+2014> that the US should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.<U+201D> \nThe interview took place nine months after the Hamas movement claimed 76 of the 132 parliamentary seats, pushing aside the US-favored Fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet. That victory was neither welcomed in Israel, nor in the US. In Washington, where Hamas is considered a terrorist organization, officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a Palestinian Authority that included Hamas. \nThen-President George W. Bush spoke of the elections as symbolizing the <U+201C>power of democracy,<U+201D> but refused to deal with Hamas as long as it opposed Israel<U+2019>s existence and espoused violence. \nThat day in September 2006, Clinton made <U+201C>odd and controversial comments,<U+201D> all now saved on the 45-minute record that Chomsky <U+201C>held onto all these years.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>I went to my bosses at the time,<U+201D> Chomsky told the Observer. <U+201C>The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody <U+2014> even a direct quote from anyone <U+2014> in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn<U+2019>t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.<U+201D> \nThe latest revelation comes after repeated accusations by the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump who says that the media and the political establishment have rigged the 2016 election against him. \nIt would seem that the crooked Mrs Clinton thinks nothing of rigging any election to suit her agenda.",

Chris Christie. | AP Photo/Mel Evans By Katie Jennings 11/11/16 05:20 AM EST President-elect Donald Trump<U+2019>s <U+201C>repeal and replace<U+201D> stance on Obamacare puts New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie <U+2014> and more than a dozen other Republican governors who chose to expand Medicaid <U+2014> in a tough spot. Christie has been a vocal opponent of President Obama<U+2019>s signature health care law, but has supported one specific provision which has enabled New Jersey to save millions of dollars in Medicaid costs while simultaneously expanding coverage to more than a half-million residents. Story Continued Below <U+201C>There were naysayers, both inside the state and around the country,<U+201D> Christie said in August at a Statehouse press conference where he boasted of the benefits of his decision to expand Medicaid. <U+201C>They were wrong then, and they<U+2019>re proven wrong now.<U+201D> The federal government usually offers a dollar-for-dollar match for Medicaid funds in New Jersey. But for the newly eligible expansion population who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, the federal government covers 100 percent of the cost. The match amount decreases to 90 percent by 2020. It<U+2019>s an attractive option for governors to get more residents covered with the federal government picking up the tab. Trump<U+2019>s vice president, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, also chose to expand Medicaid. But the future of the Affordable Care Act and, by extension, the fate of these 566,655 New Jersey residents who gained coverage , is uncertain in a Trump administration in which Christie may get a top job. Kathy Hempstead, who oversees insurance coverage programs at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said she would be surprised if the Republican Congress took away the expansion provision and not put anything in its place. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s not just millions of people who are covered, but it<U+2019>s also big fiscal implications for states,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>If anything gets taken away, I think there<U+2019>s going to be an attempt to replace at least some of that federal funding.<U+201D> In August, Christie said the state<U+2019>s share of overall Medicaid expenses has decreased from 45 percent in 2014 to 39 percent in 2015 because New Jersey was able to capitalize on federal funds to pay for the expanded program. This amounted to a savings to the state of $73.8 million year-over-year, according to numbers provided by the state Treasury Department, plus an increase of more than $1.9 billion in federal funds in the same period. Asked if Christie would advocate to keep Medicaid expansion in the Obamacare replacement option, spokesman Brian Murray said the governor was <U+201C>busy with the transition<U+201D> and the office was <U+201C>not engaging in any speculative story lines.<U+201D> The health care policy proposal posted on Trump<U+2019>s transition website Thursday only says the president-elect intends to <U+201C>maximize flexibility for States in administering Medicaid.<U+201D> His campaign website had indicated he would seek to implement a block grant system, which offers a set amount of funding from the federal government, rather than matching funds, which shifts costs more fully onto the states. <U+201C>Usually when people talk about block grants they<U+2019>re talking about more flexibility and less money,<U+201D> Hempstead said. For example, in 2011, Paul Ryan, who at the time chaired the House Budget Committee, proposed block granting Medicaid to the states in an effort to reduce federal spending by $810 billion over 10 years, as part of a larger Republican budget proposal. It passed the House, but failed to make it out of the Senate. <U+201C>Under a best case scenario from the beneficiaries<U+2019> perspective, the [Medicaid block grant] program would erode slowly over time as the budget constraint becomes more binding,<U+201D> said Joel Cantor, director of the Center for State Health Policy at Rutgers. <U+201C>Those who were added last would probably lose their coverage first - namely adults without dependent children.<U+201D> If states are faced with billions of dollars less than expected, it could mean tightening eligibility rules, changing provider reimbursement, or going back to the drawing board on health systems transformations. <U+201C>A lot of this is more psychological than it is fiscal,<U+201D> said Ray Castro, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective. Governors won<U+2019>t be able to predict Medicaid utilization costs, but they would only have the option of a finite pool of money under the block grant system, he said. <U+201C>Before [Medicaid] was the state<U+2019>s big piggy bank,<U+201D> he said. In the block grant scenario, it would be a <U+201C>huge albatross across [a governor<U+2019>s] neck that is taking a huge amount off your budget and you don<U+2019>t even know how much money you<U+2019>re going to get.<U+201D> Matt Friedman's must-read briefing on the Garden State's important news of the day Our morning email about New Jersey health care policy and politics A morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on New Jersey politics and policy.

Epstein \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-feuds-over-support-for-donald-trump-1476146036 \n text: Republicans, still reeling from a videotape in which Donald Trump speaks crudely about women, openly bickered Monday as they found themselves at risk of losing the White House, the Senate and maybe even the House of Representatives. House Speaker Paul Ryan cut the cord to the Trump campaign Monday, telling House colleagues to do what they needed to survive politically while he would neither campaign for nor defend their party<U+2019>s presidential nominee. His focus, he told them, will be on holding the GOP House majority and on <U+201C>making sure that Hillary Clinton does not get a blank check<U+201D> if the Democratic nominee prevails in November and her party seizes control of the Senate. Capital Journal is WSJ.com<U+2019>s home for Election 2016 news. The events presented a remarkable spectacle of the party<U+2019>s chaotic state. It is unprecedented in recent political history for a presidential nominee to be repudiated by his party<U+2019>s congressional leadership. Republicans have to reach back to 1964 to find an example of a nominee, Barry Goldwater, who wrought lasting divisions within the party. Many Republican National Committee members and other Trump supporters reacted in fury and called their leaders cowards for not standing by Mr. Trump. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re tired of a bunch of fraidy-cat elected officials who at the very drop of a hat turn tail when the going gets rough,<U+201D> said Bruce Ash, the RNC committee member for Arizona. He predicted that Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain, who on Saturday recanted his endorsement of Mr. Trump, would pay a price in his re-election bid next month. <U+201C>John McCain may have lost his re-election,<U+201D> Mr. Ash said Monday. <U+201C>This is a miscalculation created in the middle of a frenzy.<U+201D> Mr. Ryan faced blowback from some members of his House conference, many of whom represent districts thick with Trump supporters. The backlash could complicate his bid for re-election as speaker in 2017, assuming his party holds its majority. <U+201C>Just bad-mouthing our candidate is not acceptable,<U+201D> said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R., Calif.) after hearing Mr. Ryan say he wouldn<U+2019>t defend or campaign with Mr. Trump. <U+201C>If you<U+2019>re saying bad things about your candidate, you might as well be on the other side.<U+201D> With pro-Trump protesters assembled outside the RNC doors, GOP Chairman Reince Priebus held a Monday afternoon conference call for the 168 RNC members to assure them that, contrary to media reports, the committee isn<U+2019>t abandoning Mr. Trump. Election Day is still almost a month away, which leaves time for this year<U+2019>s unpredictable presidential race to take even more twists and turns. Yet the events of recent days revealed a party spinning apart with no clear leader to try to put it back together in time for the November showdown with Mrs. Clinton and her multimillion-dollar voter-turnout machine. In fact, things could get worse as Mr. Trump and his allies have promised retribution for those who crossed him. <U+201C>So many self-righteous hypocrites,<U+201D> he tweeted Sunday. <U+201C>Watch their poll numbers<U+2014>and elections<U+2014>go down!<U+201D> The political costs of cutting off Mr. Trump were underscored by a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Monday to gauge the impact of the release of the lewd Trump tape, which showed him using vulgar language to describe his forcing himself on women. In the poll, two-thirds of Republicans said they believed GOP officials shouldn<U+2019>t abandon the candidate over the video. Still, the poll showed the toll the episode is taking on the party. It found that Mrs. Clinton had opened an 11-point lead over Mr. Trump, up from a 6-point lead in September. More worrisome still for the party<U+2019>s congressional establishment, the poll found that Democrats<U+2019> advantage on the question of which party should control Congress widened to 7 percentage points, up from 3 percentage points last month. The seeds of a split between the party<U+2019>s presidential nominee and its top elected official, Mr. Ryan, were planted during the primary season when Mr. Trump mocked and belittled some of the GOP<U+2019>s brightest stars. His elevation to party standard bearer was never a comfortable one, but the swiftness of the break was astonishing, the culmination of three head-spinning days. It began with the release late Friday of the 2005 video laden with vulgar words never before heard by voters from the mouth of a presidential candidate. <U+201C>When you<U+2019>re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.<U+2026>Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything,<U+201D> Mr. Trump added. Mr. Trump also referred to a married woman whom he said he tried to seduce: <U+201C>I moved on her and I failed. I<U+2019>ll admit it. I did try and f<U+2014>her.<U+2026><U+201D> Dozens of Republicans denounced the statement but only a handful rescinded their endorsements Friday. The bluntest rebuke came when Mr. Ryan un-invited Mr. Trump to a rally with him in his home state of Wisconsin, although Mr. Ryan did not take back his endorsement. By midnight, Mr. Trump released a videotaped message with a grudging apology. An hour later, a furious Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who had sparred with Mr. Trump for months, posted a call on Twitter for Mr. Trump to <U+201C>step aside,<U+201D> setting off an apparent chain reaction. At 11:14 a.m. Saturday, Sen. Mike Crapo withdrew his endorsement, tweeting that the nominee<U+2019>s <U+201C>repeated actions and comments toward women have been disrespectful, profane and demeaning.<U+201D> At 11:37 a.m., New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte tweeted that she would write in the name of vice presidential nominee Mike Pence instead of voting for Mr. Trump. Unlike Mr. Lee and Mr. Crapo, Ms. Ayotte<U+2019>s decision was steeped in risk as she is facing one of the most competitive re-election races in the 2016 season. She already had become mired in controversy when she called her party<U+2019>s nominee a good role model, only later to take it back. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s crudeness in the video had struck a chord in Ms. Ayotte, who prosecuted sex crimes in the New Hampshire attorney general<U+2019>s office. And then there was her preteen daughter; the senator told reporters the following day that she couldn<U+2019>t look the girl in the eye and support Mr. Trump. Less than two hours later, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, a party loyalist, was the first member of Senate GOP leadership to call for Mr. Trump to step aside. <U+201C>Donald Trump should withdraw and Mike Pence should be our nominee effective immediately,<U+201D> Mr. Thune said in a tweet at 12:51 p.m. on Saturday. Mr. Thune<U+2019>s statement rankled with some of his constituents, who angrily posted on his Facebook page over the weekend that they would not be supporting him in November. Mr. Thune is up for re-election this year, but is still expected to easily win his race. At 2:10 and 2:21, Alaska<U+2019>s two senators abandoned Mr. Trump. The defections kept coming until 9:30 p.m., when Ohio Sen. Rob Portman withdrew his support<U+2014>forcing Mr. Trump to compete in a critical presidential battleground state without the backing of its Republican senator and governor, John Kasich, a former GOP primary rival. As the initial flurry settled down, many Republican lawmakers said they would wait until Sunday<U+2019>s debate to decide their course. In that showdown, Mr. Trump offered a brief apology for his remarks in the video and then launched into a relentless attack on Mrs. Clinton, ranging from her husband<U+2019>s infidelities in the 1990s to her use of a personal email server while running the State Department. While the performance turned off some voters, it delighted his core supporters who now are threatening to turn on the Republican insiders who have abandoned their champion. <U+201C>I think they<U+2019>re all horrible,<U+201D> said 77-year-old retiree Anita Tinnion, who attended Mr. Trump<U+2019>s Monday rally in Ambridge, Pa. <U+201C>What he said wasn<U+2019>t nice and he apologized. They<U+2019>re all so high and mighty? I think he<U+2019>s better off without them.<U+201D> <U+2014>Siobhan Hughes and Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.

It is insane,<U+201D> he told the student paper. <U+201C>The crazier and crazier that this left gets .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. the more the alt-right is going to be laughing their asses off [and] getting more pissed.<U+201D>, he was quoted as saying. \n{snip} \nBut Rectenwald says he began getting <U+201C>dirty looks<U+201D> in his department and on Wednesday figured out why: A 12-person committee calling itself the Liberal Studies Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Working Group, including two deans, published a letter to the editor in the same paper. \n<U+201C>As long as he airs his views with so little appeal to evidence and civility, we must find him guilty of illogic and incivility in a community that predicates its work in great part on rational thought and the civil exchange of ideas,<U+201D> they wrote of the untenured assistant professor. \n<U+201C>We seek to create a dynamic community that values full participation. Such efforts are not the <U+2018>destruction of academic integrity<U+2019> Professor Rectenwald suggests, but rather what make possible our program<U+2019>s approach to global studies,<U+201D> they argued. Rectenwald likened the attack to <U+201C>a Salem witch trial. They took my views personally. I never even mentioned them and I never even said NYU liberal studies program. I was talking about academia at large,<U+201D> said the professor, a popular instructor who was graded 4.4 out of 5 on ratemyprofessors.com . \nThe same day the letter was published, Rectenwald was summoned to a meeting with his department dean and an HR representative, he says. \n<U+201C>They claimed they were worried about me and a couple people had expressed concern about my mental health. They suggested my voicing these opinions was a cry for help,<U+201D> Rectenwald told The Post. <U+201C>Then they said I should leave and get help.<U+201D> \n{snip} \nStudents told him that professors openly discussed with students how he may be fired. \nThe leave has <U+201C>absolutely zero to do with his Twitter account or his opinions on issues of the day,<U+201D> said NYU spokesman Matt Nagel. \nBut Rectenwald is disheartened. \n<U+201C>I<U+2019>m afraid my academic career is over,<U+201D> he said Rectenwald. <U+201C>Academic freedom: It<U+2019>s great, as long as you don<U+2019>t use it.<U+201D>",

His shirt sleeves rolled up, his vowels slipping off the ends of his words, his last day on the campaign trail finally here, Mr. Obama soaked up an unseasonably warm autumn sun on a baseball field at the University of Michigan on Monday, and drank in the energy of his political finale. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve got one more day, Michigan <U+2014> one more day,<U+201D> he said, gazing out over a crowd of more than 9,000 at midday. But Mr. Obama was not quite ready for it to be over. <U+201C>This is gonna be my last<U+201D> <U+2014> he caught himself <U+2014> <U+201C>probably my last day of campaigning for a while.<U+201D> For Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton , Monday<U+2019>s cross-country travels were all about tomorrow. For Mr. Obama, his travels here to Michigan, and then to New Hampshire and Philadelphia, were part victory lap and part nostalgia tour, as he was accompanied on Air Force One by some of his longest-serving aides, and was ushered in and out of rallies by the same U2 and Bruce Springsteen anthems that were the soundtracks of his campaigns. But his core mission was to implore voters across the country to rally behind Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday, or see the values and ideals that fueled his rise and powered his agenda defeated. So Mr. Obama stumped on Monday with the fervor of a man battling to preserve his legacy and with the joy of one who has watched his approval ratings tick higher as the presidential race<U+2019>s tenor has sunk ever lower, savoring the almost palpable sense at Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s rallies that Americans will miss him when he is gone. <U+201C>Whatever credibility I<U+2019>ve earned after eight years as president,<U+201D> Mr. Obama said, <U+201C>I am asking you to trust me on this one.<U+201D> <U+201C>I already voted,<U+201D> he added. <U+201C>I voted for Hillary Clinton, because I am absolutely confident that when she is president, this country will be in good hands <U+2014> and I<U+2019>m asking you to do the same.<U+201D> <U+201C>I love you!<U+201D> supporters kept shouting at the president as he turned serious to lay out the stakes of an extraordinary race. <U+201C>I love you back <U+2014> I do,<U+201D> Mr. Obama said in Michigan. <U+201C>But tomorrow, you will choose whether we continue this journey of progress, or whether it all goes out the window.<U+201D> Nostalgia aside, there was no mistaking the seriousness of his message. Mr. Trump could never be trusted with control over the nation<U+2019>s nuclear arsenal, the president said, if his own staff regarded him as too temperamental to use restraint on social media. <U+201C>Over the weekend, his campaign took away his Twitter account,<U+201D> Mr. Obama said, referring to a report in T he New York Times about the closing days of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign. <U+201C>Now, if your closest advisers don<U+2019>t trust you to tweet, then how can we trust him with the nuclear codes?<U+201D> <U+201C>Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief,<U+201D> Mr. Obama said. <U+201C>He<U+2019>s unqualified to be America<U+2019>s chief executive.<U+201D> Mr. Obama began his day at the White House, striding out of the residence to board Marine One just after 9:30 a.m. to begin his final campaign sprint. He rarely paused in the hours that followed, jetting from state to state on Air Force One, speeding from airport to rally site and back again in his armored limousine, racing against the clock on a historic presidential contest and his own campaign denouement. In New Hampshire, his motorcade rushed at sunset down roads flanked by flaming-red and burnt-orange foliage to deliver him to a rally that drew more than 7,600. At the airport in Portsmouth, he confessed to a young boy who asked about the presidential jumbo jet that he was reluctant to relinquish Air Force One. <U+201C>I am going to miss this plane,<U+201D> he told the boy with a smile. <U+201C>I only have it for a few more months.<U+201D> His itinerary on Monday took the president to three states that he won in 2008 and 2012, and that are now crucial bulwarks for Mrs. Clinton. All three are also places where it is more difficult for Democrats to turn out their core supporters because they do not offer early voting. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s not that often you get the chance to move history in a better direction,<U+201D> Mr. Obama said. <U+201C>This is one of those moments. Don<U+2019>t let it slip away.<U+201D> In Michigan, he allowed himself a few moments to gloat, reminding voters of all that his administration had done to pull American automobile makers from the brink of bankruptcy. <U+201C>I think I<U+2019>ve earned some credibility here,<U+201D> Mr. Obama said tartly, repeating the phrase three times as he checked off the metrics of a resurgent automobile industry and recovering manufacturing sector. He returned to his trademark campaign-trail catchphrases. As he elicited jeers by reciting a litany of criticisms of Mr. Trump <U+2014> his not paying taxes, his comments about immigrants, women and Muslims <U+2014> Mr. Obama barked, <U+201C>Don<U+2019>t boo. Vote!<U+201D> He sparked chants of <U+201C>Yes we can!<U+201D> and <U+201C>O-BAM-A.<U+201D> In Durham, N.H., he returned to the now-familiar story about how his 2008 campaign found its signature <U+201C>Fired up! Ready to go!<U+201D> theme, borrowed from a woman in a small town in South Carolina, whom he met after getting soaked in a driving rain to attend a gathering of only about 20 people. <U+201C>Every meeting she goes to, she does this thing<U+201D> of chanting the refrain, Mr. Obama said. <U+201C>Which is kind of strange. But the thing is that after a while, I get kind of fired up,<U+201D> Mr. Obama said. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m starting to feel like I<U+2019>m ready to go.<U+201D> When he retired to his cabin on Air Force One, Mr. Obama sat with senior adviser Valerie B. Jarrett, a confidante whose friendship with Mr. Obama dates to his Chicago days, and Susan E. Rice, his national security adviser. Brian Deese, his senior adviser for climate change, came too, along with Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary who has been with him throughout his presidency, and David Simas, his political director. But it was in the thronging crowd that Mr. Obama seemed to relive his campaign experience most poignantly. In Ann Arbor, he lingered for several minutes after he finished speaking, clasping hands with supporters and grinning at them broadly, as the strains of Mr. Springsteen<U+2019>s <U+201C>Land of Hope and Dreams<U+201D> pulsed the stadium, a throwback to four years ago. Then he turned on his heel to go, and a sudden cheer went up as people throughout the emptying stadium raised their arms and gave the president one final wave goodbye.

People gather at the al-Zaydiya security headquarters that was destroyed by Saudi-led airstrikes Saturday, in the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, Yemen, Sunday, Oct. 30, 2016. Security and medical officials say dozens of prisoners and security personnel are feared dead after airstrikes battered two prisons inside the security headquarters. (AP Photo/Abdoo Alkarim Alayashy) \nWhile the biggest single Saudi airstrike over the weekend in Yemen targeted a prison in Hodeidah, dozens of other strikes were reported over the weekend by villagers around Taiz and in the Maarib Province, with attacks killing at least 27 civilians , and wounding a number of others. \nMost of the casualties were in Taiz, where attacks destroyed several homes and caused a large number of injuries. With hospitals in the area having very limited access to medicine because of the naval blockade, many of those injuries proved fatal. \nThe attacks in Maarib and Saada, however, may prove more devastating to the country in the long run, targeting some of the very limited farmland Yemen has, destroying a number of villagers<U+2019> homes and burning a lot of that farmland. Yemen has to import some 90 percent of its food under normal circumstances, with such imports severely limited by the blockade, and the loss of farmland just adds to food insecurity in the nation. \nSaudi Arabia has been coming under growing international criticism for its air war against Yemen, with massive numbers of civilians killed and little sign that the promised improvements to targeting will ever amount to anything. \nPrevious article from Anti-war.com From October 30th: \nMostly destroyed and no longer usable, the prison in the Yemeni city of Hodeidah held 84 inmates until Saturday, when Saudi Arabian warplanes repeatedly bombed it, killing at least 60 of the people within and wounding dozens of others. \nThe exact number of prisoners killed compared to guards is unknown, though prisoners are said to be the vast majority. The prison was leveled in the attack, according to witnesses, and rescue workers are still looking through the rubble, with others believed trapped within. \nThree airstrikes were targeted against the prison, with the first hitting it directly, bringing down the roof, and the follow-up attacks targeting the gates and the administration buildings. The Saudi coalition insisted the attacks were in keeping with targeting procedures, noting the prison was known to have Houthi security forces within. \nIt is unclear who the prisoners generally were at the prison, but deliberately attacking a prison will doubtless add to concerns about Saudi Arabia<U+2019>s standards for airstrikes against Yemen, which have killed massive numbers of civilians over the past 19 months. \nThis article originally appeared in Anti-War.com Be Sociable, Share!",

What type of leader awakens at three o<U+2019>clock in the morning,<U+201D> Biden said at a Hillary Clinton rally in Orlando, pausing as the crowd interrupted him with laughter. <U+201C>No, no, no, no, no, I<U+2019>m being deadly earnest. You don<U+2019>t have to be a psychologist or psychiatrist, but what kind of a leader awakens at three o<U+2019>clock in the morning and tweets Hillary helped, quote, disgusting Alicia M, become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in a debate. Or 3:30 in the morning? This guy wants to be president of the United States of America.<U+201D> Story Continued Below The wee-hours Twitter rant to which Biden referred occurred early last Friday morning, punctuating a week that Trump<U+2019>s team spent defending itself in the face of the GOP nominee<U+2019>s long history of derogatory remarks towards women. At last week<U+2019>s presidential debate, Clinton recalled Alicia Machado, who was crowned Miss Universe in 1996 and who Trump called <U+201C>Miss Piggy,<U+201D> because of her supposed weight gain, and <U+201C>Miss Housekeeping,<U+201D> referencing her Hispanic heritage. In his Friday flurry of Twitter posts, Trump went on to charge that Clinton had been <U+201C>duped and used<U+201D> by Machado. He urged his followers to <U+201C>check out [Machado<U+2019>s] sex tape and past,<U+201D> references to a 1998 murder investigation in which she was never charged and rumors that she has appeared in pornographic films, of which there is no evidence. By Nolan D. McCaskill After Clinton brought her up at the debate, Machado quickly vaulted into the political spotlight, doing interviews with NBC<U+2019>s <U+201C>Today<U+201D> show and Cosmopolitan Magazine. She told the latter that Trump<U+2019>s name-calling had triggered a return of her bulimia that took her years to recover from and that she had become a U.S. citizen this summer specifically so that she could vote against the real estate mogul. In response, Trump told Fox News that Machado was <U+201C>the worst we ever had<U+201D> at the Miss Universe pageant because <U+201C>she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.<U+201D> He added that of all the slights Clinton had launched his way at Monday night<U+2019>s debate, recalling Machado was the only one that got under his skin. Aside from the issue of Trump<U+2019>s treatment of Machado, Biden also attacked the Manhattan billionaire<U+2019>s lack of awareness on issues of foreign policy. He slammed Trump<U+2019>s <U+201C>unabashed admiration<U+201D> for Russian President Vladimir Putin and seeming ignorance in a past interview that Russia had invaded Ukraine. <U+201C>To his credit he recently acknowledged he realized Crimea is part of Ukraine, which is like he<U+2019>s going to acknowledge there<U+2019>s gravity later, too,<U+201D> Biden joked. The vice president seemed unable to help himself from taking another shot at Trump when a baby began crying at the start of his remarks. <U+201C>Unlike Trump I really don<U+2019>t mind, the baby crying, I mean,<U+201D> Biden said, recalling a Trump campaign event over the summer when Trump ejected a baby who was making noise during his speech.

I couldn<U+2019>t be silent any more. Voting is not enough,<U+201D> said Tonya Debnam, a Realtor. She was one of more than 360 people who turned up for a debate-watching party<U+00A0>hosted by the group last week. North Carolina was a reach for then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008, when he barely won the state, and an afterthought in 2012, when he barely lost it. This year, it has become central to the Clinton strategy. The Clinton campaign chose the state for Mr. Obama<U+2019>s first campaign rally this year. Mrs. Clinton has headlined four events there since<U+00A0>Sept. 1, and it is the only battleground she has appeared in more times over that span than Republican Donald Trump. The campaign has had staff on the ground since April and has 33 offices in the state. Since<U+00A0>Aug. 1, the Clinton campaign and supportive groups have spent or reserved more than $22 million on TV ads in North Carolina, according to an independent ad tracker. That is nearly as much spending as in Pennsylvania. The last six public polls have all had Mrs. Clinton ahead, though often inside the margin of error. A survey released<U+00A0>Tuesday by Elon University showed her leading Mr. Trump, 45% to 39%, among likely voters. Mrs. Clinton had trailed him<U+00A0>by one point in a September Elon poll. North Carolina isn<U+2019>t the easiest state for Mrs. Clinton to win, or even the most important, Clinton advisers say. But they see it as a <U+201C>roadblock<U+201D><U+2014>if she can take it, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s path to victory becomes much more difficult. Many Democrats now say the simplest Electoral College path for Mrs. Clinton would be to win the swing state of Virginia, where she is polling well, and hold the traditionally Democratic states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, plus all the other safe Democratic states. Under that scenario, a win in North Carolina would bring Mrs. Clinton victory, even if she lost Ohio, Florida and every other competitive state. Before 2008, Democrats hadn<U+2019>t won a presidential contest in North Carolina since 1976, and their improving fortunes are mostly due to changing demographics. It is among the fastest-growing and -urbanizing states, and a place where newcomers will hold significant sway in the presidential election. North Carolina grew by<U+00A0>5.3% from 2000 to 2015, faster than the national rate of 4.1%,<U+00A0>according to the<U+00A0>Census Bureau.<U+00A0>About 27%<U+00A0>of<U+00A0>that population increase took place in Democratic strongholds<U+2014>Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, and Wake County, home to Raleigh. A Clinton victory, if it comes, would be built on votes from African-Americans and left-leaning transplants. About half of North Carolina<U+2019>s registered voters are now from somewhere else, according to a September analysis of state elections data by Rebecca Tippett, who directs Carolina Demography at the<U+00A0>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. New York is the second most common birthplace, followed by places like Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. <U+201C>This is a real purple state now,<U+201D> said Jim Hunt, a Democrat who served as the state<U+2019>s governor for 16 years over two stints. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s getting bluer and bluer.<U+201D> Lawrence Shaheen, a Republican consultant in suburban Charlotte, predicted North Carolina would be decided in the suburbs, where Mrs. Clinton is benefiting from unease with Mr. Trump and the state law known as House Bill 2. The law, championed by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, requires transgender people to use the public bathroom corresponding with the gender on their birth certificate. It has led to boycotts of the state, and Mr. Shaheen said the law had made it difficult for his legislative clients to raise funds in the suburbs. A Clinton campaign aide said controversy over the law has mobilized Democrats and helps Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s chances. Democrats appear to be off to a strong start in early voting, which is expected to make up as much as 60% of all ballots cast. As of<U+00A0>Wednesday,<U+00A0>17,317 ballots had been accepted, a slight drop from this time in 2012, according to an analysis by Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C. Still, Democrats are ahead of where they were four years ago in returned and accepted, or properly completed, ballots, while Republicans lag behind their pace of four years ago, Mr. Bitzer said. The state and national Republican<U+00A0>parties have 175 paid staffers on the ground and are coordinating with the Trump campaign, which has a small but growing staff here, according to the state party executive director. Last week the state GOP began holding <U+201C>Trump<U+00A0>Tuesday<U+201D> volunteer training parties at a dozen sites. On Sunday, Mrs. Clinton campaigned in Charlotte , visiting an African-American church. Two days later, first lady Michelle Obama campaigned in Charlotte and Raleigh, where she addressed some 6,000 people at North Carolina State University. She said Mrs. Clinton could win North Carolina, but only if young people turned out and voted for her. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s not enough to come to a rally, get a selfie,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>I know y<U+2019>all love your selfies.<U+201D> She added: <U+201C>Elections aren<U+2019>t just about who votes, but who doesn<U+2019>t vote.<U+201D> Write to Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com",

In Montenegro, which split from Serbia a decade ago, NATO is on Friday due to wrap up a five-day disaster-relief drill of 680 unarmed personnel from seven NATO members and 10 partner countries including Serbia. \"It is in the interest of Montenegro, in the interest of NATO, and also in the interest of the region, to be part of NATO and promote Euro-Atlantic values in the Balkans, and these values benefit each and every one of us,\" Montenegro's deputy Prime Minister Dusko Markovic , said about the exercise. Across the border, in Serbia, Russia flew in its paratroopers along with allied Belarus for an exercise called \"Slavic Brotherhood\", which according the Serbian defence ministry focuses on \"fighting terrorism\". \nThe drills are set to last until November 9 and will include 212 Russian, 450 Serbian and 56 Belarusian troops. Three Russian transport planes have already landed in Belgrade on Wednesday bringing in soldiers and equipment. \nDrills in the two former Yugoslav republics reflect mounting tensions between Russia and the West over a variety of geopolitical issues including conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. \nREAD MORE: RUSSIA IS MOVING NUKES WEST IN RESPONSE TO CONTINUING NATO AGGRESSION \nIn Serbia, NATO is hugely unpopular after its 1999 bombing ousted Belgrade's armed forces out of its former southern province of Kosovo. \nBut as part of its integrations with the West, Serbia last year signed the Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP), the highest level of cooperation between NATO and a country not aspiring to join. \nAn EU candidate, Serbia insists that it is militarily neutral, but maintains close ties with Russia, its Orthodox Christian and Slavic superpower ally, the biggest gas and oil source and an obstacle to Kosovo's membership in the United Nations. \nLast year Montenegro accepted an invitation to join NATO, a move that soured relations withRussia. Ahead of October's parliamentary vote Montenegro's outgoing Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic accused Moscow of meddling in country's elections and of financing the opposition. A fifth of the votes in the poll went to an anti-NATO, pro-Serbia bloc. Article by Doc Burkhart , Vice-President, General Manager and co-host of TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles Got a news tip?

An electoral board showing France<U+2019>s far-right National Front president Marine Le Pen and reading: 100% National Front. 0% migrants is pictured during a demonstration in Forges-les-Bains, south of Paris, France, Saturday, Oct. 8, 2016. \nFrance<U+2019>s National Front is known to have diverse funding streams, but an investigation published this week unveiled a new potential funder: the United Arab Emirates. \nIt is certainly an odd source of funding for a party whose leader, Marine Le Pen, has been taken to court for anti-Muslim hate speech. \nLe Pen<U+2019>s Russian networks are already well known: in 2014, the National Front received a loan of <U+20AC>11mn ($12mn) from the First Czech Russian Bank. \nThis fact was admitted by the party<U+2019>s treasurer, Wallerand de Saint-Just, who said: <U+201C>The party makes requests to foreign banks, why not Russian banks?<U+201D> \nThe latest controversy was sparked by a book by famed French investigative journalists Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot. In 2004, the journalistic duo were even held hostage at one point by Islamic militants in Iraq. \nTitled Nos tr<U+00E8>s chers <U+00E9>mirs (Our dear emirs), their latest book exposes the murky relationship between a number of French politicians and the countries of the Arabian Gulf. \nIn the wake of the controversy caused by the book<U+2019>s publication, the news website Mediapart has raised the question of possible funding of Marine Le Pen<U+2019>s presidential campaign by the UAE. \nA source familiar with the far-right French party told Middle East Eye: <U+201C>It is true that in 2014 Marine Le Pen met an Emirati emissary in her residence in Montrebout, in the Hauts-de-Seine region, who offered to help her. \n<U+201C>That being said, the FN [National Front] has always been clear on this point: it has two enemies, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which it regards as sponsors of wahhabism, but in her eyes the Emiratis are an ally in the fight against radicalisation.<U+201D> \nWahhabism is an ultra-orthodox strand of Sunni Islam practised in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, and it has become an increasingly popular theme to explain the chaos gripping the Middle East. \n<U+201C>France must break its relations with Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which helped, assisted, and funded Islamic fundamentalists worldwide,<U+201D> Le Pen said in September 2014 on France 24. \n<U+201C>We must rely on those Muslim countries which fight fundamentalism,<U+201D> she added, naming the UAE and Egypt as examples of such countries and calling for <U+201C>a wide coalition<U+201D> against Islamic extremism. \nIn 2014, pro-Le Pen French MEP Jean-Luc Schaffhauser told Mediapart that he had negotiated a loan at a rate of 2.8 percent with the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, but that it in the event it did not materialize. \nThe following year in May, Le Pen travelled to Cairo to meet with the Grand Imam of al-Azhar Mosque <U+2013> a trip allegedly funded by the UAE, according to Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot. \nThe allegation was denied earlier this week by National Front MEP and Secretary General Nicolas Bay, who told France 2 television: <U+201C>That is incorrect.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>For now, about 50 percent of the campaign should be funded by Cotelec, the FN<U+2019>s funding organisation that is chaired by Jean-Marie Le Pen,<U+201D> the source close to the party told MEE. \nThese loans granted to the party by its members will be refunded once the state has itself reimbursed the campaign. This rule applies to all parties that win more than 5 percent of the vote in the first round of the elections. \n<U+201C>The needs for the first round are estimated at around <U+20AC>12mn, and <U+20AC>21mn for the second round. For the first round, they still lack <U+20AC>6-7 million, but they are aware of the fact that appealing to the Gulf countries harm them in terms of image,<U+201D> the source added. \n<U+201C>So at first, the goal is to look for loans in European countries. If this is not enough, they will turn to the Russians, and thirdly, to the UAE. We can say that this is an option, but a third choice option.<U+201D> \nThe National Front has indicated that around 40 banks have refused to lend it money. Yet polls assure that Le Pen will win more than the 5 percent of votes needed to be reimbursed by the state. \n<U+201C>If we have to borrow abroad, we will borrow abroad,<U+201D> Wallerand de Saint-Just, the party<U+2019>s treasurer, told France 3. <U+201C>There are no exceptions to this, either in Russia, Argentina, or in the United States<U+2026> and why not in the Middle East?<U+201D>",

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings and Rep. John Conyers, Jr., ranking members on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and House Judiciary Committee, respectively, cited Trump campaign surrogate Rudy Giuliani<U+2019>s suggestion on Fox News on Friday that he <U+201C>heard about<U+201D> a new FBI review of materials in the Hillary Clinton email investigation from <U+201C>former FBI agents<U+201D> and expected such an announcement to come earlier. Story Continued Below FBI Director James Comey offered few details about the agency's latest review of emails that might be relevant to Clinton investigation after he sent a brief letter to lawmakers notifying them of the new probe. News outlets have relied on unnamed department sources in their follow-up reporting following the bombshell revelation last Friday. <U+201C>It is absolutely unacceptable for the FBI to leak unsubstantiated<U+2014>and in some cases false<U+2014>information about one presidential candidate to benefit the other candidate,<U+201D> Cummings and Conyers wrote to Inspector General Michael Horowitz on Friday. <U+201C>Leaking this information to former FBI officials as a conduit to the Trump campaign is equally intolerable.<U+201D> When asked about the letter during an TV appearance Friday evening, Giuliani claimed he knew nothing about Comey<U+2019>s missive to Congress before it was released.

Gold for December delivery settled up 0.8% at $1,273.60 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, closing at the highest level since October 3. The drop in gold prices over the past few weeks has brought some buyers back into the market, traders said. Gold was also supported by a weaker economic outlook on Tuesday, after the Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence fell to 98.6 in October from 103.5 in September, falling short of economist expectations. <U+201C>You<U+2019>re seeing a flight to safety,<U+201D> said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures. As gold prices have drawn closer to $1,250 an ounce, <U+201C>there<U+2019>s some life that steps in<U+201D> to the market, he said. Earlier this month, a run of strong U.S. economic data strengthened the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year . The prospect of higher rates has sapped the appeal of commodities that don<U+2019>t pay interest and pushed gold below $1,300 an ounce. Nitesh Shah, commodities strategist at ETF Securities, said demand had remained resilient since the selloff. He said some investors were speculating that the market had fallen too far in anticipation of higher rates and an actual increase might be followed by a rebound. He added that the impending U.S. presidential election was also likely providing some support for the commodity, which is seen as a haven, as investors seek to insure portfolios against a victory for Republican nominee Donald Trump, a result that could rattle financial markets. <U+201C>As that date [Nov. 8] approaches, people are making sure they<U+2019>ve got these hedges in their portfolio, just in case,<U+201D> Mr. Shah said. Analysts at UBS said they would be monitoring flows in and out of exchange-traded funds that purchase gold, after Friday saw a large net outflow of 518,000 ounces. That reduction -- the biggest one-day decline since July 2013<U+2014>marked a change from the recent pattern of resilient inflows into ETFs. With the London gold price little changed since its close Friday, UBS noted that the market <U+201C>seems to have taken [Friday<U+2019>s] selling quite well for now.<U+201D> But there is a risk that ETF buyers who entered the market at higher levels could get <U+201C>spooked<U+201D> and start selling, UBS said. <U+201C>ETF selling presents risks to the market -- the key question right now is whether the chunky selling on Friday was a one-off or if outflows would continue in the days ahead,<U+201D> UBS said.

As a result, she could see colored flashes, lines, and spots when signals were sent to her brain from a computer. \nThe woman, who wished to remain anonymous, suffered no significant adverse side effects in the process, according to a statement. \nThe device, which was developed as part of the Orion 1 programme by Second Sight, uses technology to restore sight by bypassing the optic nerve to stimulate the brain<U+2019>s visual cortex, according to chairman Robert Greenberg. \nIt is designed for those who cannot benefit from the Argus II retinal system that was unveiled at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital last year, but has limited application, as it depends on the patient having some retinal cells. \nThis new system goes one step further by sending signals directly to the brain. It has the potential to restore sight to those who have gone completely blind for virtually any reason, including glaucoma, cancer, diabetic retinopathy, or trauma, according to the manufacturer. \nThe next step is to connect the implant to a camera on a pair of glasses, and the company plans to seek FDA approval in 2017 to get the go ahead to conduct these trials. \nUCLA neurosurgeon Nader Pouratian, who implanted the stimulator, said the results of the surgery are promising. \n<U+201C>Based on these results, stimulation of the visual cortex has the potential to restore useful vision to the blind, which is important for independence and improving quality of life,<U+201D> he said.",

McCaskill 10/10/16 06:06 PM EDT Updated 10/10/16 06:05 PM EDT Donald Trump emerged from Sunday night<U+2019>s presidential debate, ready to sling more mud. Trump, speaking before a rally in Pennsylvania on Monday afternoon, said he's been ganged up on ever since Friday's release of a 2005 tape that captured the billionaire speaking in incredibly crude terms about women. Story Continued Below <U+201C>I was getting beaten up for 72 hours on all the networks for inappropriate words 12 years ago <U+2014> locker room talk, whatever you wanna call it,<U+201D> Trump said, referring to the wall-to-wall coverage of comments that described his ability to get away with sexual assault. <U+201C>But, I said to myself, wait a minute <U+2014> and I just saw very inappropriate words <U+2014> but Bill Clinton sexually assaulted innocent women, and Hillary Clinton attacked those women viciously. One of them said more viciously than he attacked them.<U+201D> Trump warned against the release of more damaging tapes of his past comments, threatening to continue attacking the Clintons over former President Bill Clinton<U+2019>s alleged infidelities and Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s response to those women<U+2019>s accusations if more such tapes emerge. Though Clinton<U+2019>s campaign has denied any involvement in leaking the <U+201C>Access Hollywood<U+201D> clip that has dogged Trump<U+2019>s campaign all weekend and prompted an exodus of support from prominent Republicans, Trump said more such releases will come at a risk for the Clintons <U+2014> he cast Bill Clinton as a predator Monday and Hillary Clinton as a <U+201C>total hypocrite<U+201D> who enabled him to hurt more women. <U+201C>If they wanna release more tapes saying inappropriate things, we<U+2019>ll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate things,<U+201D> Trump said. <U+201C>There are so many of them, folks.<U+201D> Trump aggressively went after Hillary Clinton at his rally, reviving a number of attack lines he used in Sunday<U+2019>s debate all the while ignoring the news that rippled through Washington: House Speaker Paul Ryan dumped Trump earlier Monday (though he hasn<U+2019>t officially rescinded his endorsement), telling Republicans in his chamber on a conference call that he will no longer defend Trump and that they should do whatever<U+2019>s necessary to maintain their majority. By Nolan D. McCaskill Clinton emerged from Trump's weekend of wreckage with a double-digit lead over the billionaire nationally, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Monday. His 11-point deficit threatens to be a drag on congressional Republicans<U+2019> reelection efforts. Trump has repeatedly attacked Bill Clinton since the revelation of extremely lewd comments the real estate mogul made about women were exposed on Friday. In a brief written statement, Trump dismissed his remarks about trying to sleep with a married woman and groping women<U+2019>s genitals and forcibly kissing them with impunity because he<U+2019>s famous as <U+201C>locker room banter.<U+201D> He accused Bill Clinton of having said <U+201C>far worse<U+201D> to him in private conversations while golfing. But he didn<U+2019>t leave it at that, and he didn<U+2019>t stop there. He attacked the Clintons again in a video statement released shortly after midnight Saturday and once again Sunday evening at the St. Louis debate, which the GOP nominee preceded with a surprise panel on Facebook Live featuring women who have accused the Clintons of wrongdoing. Those women <U+2014> Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Kathy Shelton <U+2014> also attended the debate. Trump<U+2019>s campaign had even devised a covert plan to have the four women join the Trump family<U+2019>s box and cause a scene on national television by entering the debate hall with the 42nd president. But the plan that was thwarted by a co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, which threatened to have security remove the women from the family-only elevated box. <U+201C>You probably saw yesterday: We brought four wonderful women to St. Louis. And honestly, it was both very beautiful and very sad,<U+201D> Trump said Monday. <U+201C>Really, they had been trying to get their feelings out for so long and the media wouldn<U+2019>t take it.<U+201D> That is, until they appeared with Trump. <U+201C>So they were able to get what they wanted to get out,<U+201D> Trump said, going on to quote Broaddrick<U+2019>s accusations about Bill Clinton<U+2019>s alleged rape and Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s alleged threat. <U+201C>She<U+2019>s been struggling to get the media to pay attention to her for many, many years. So last night I decided we would expose the hypocrisy of the Clintons and the media to the entire world.<U+201D> By Toby Eckert Trump re-upped his claim that Hillary Clinton has <U+201C>hatred in her heart.<U+201D> He restated that Bill Clinton is <U+201C>the worst abuser of women ever to sit in the Oval Office<U+201D> and blamed Hillary Clinton for <U+201C>systematically<U+201D> attacking and discrediting <U+201C>the victims of Bill Clinton<U+2019>s sexual harassment and assault.<U+201D> <U+201C>These things aren<U+2019>t written by the media, but they<U+2019>re true,<U+201D> said Trump, who rattled off about a half-dozen of Bill Clinton<U+2019>s accusers but cautioned that <U+201C>many, many more<U+201D> exist (the Clintons have denied such allegations). <U+201C>For decades, Hillary Clinton has been deeply familiar with her husband<U+2019>s predatory behavior, and instead of trying to stop it, she made it possible for him to take advantage of even more women. She put even more women in harm<U+2019>s way and then she goes out and says, <U+2018>I love women, I<U+2019>m gonna help women, I<U+2019>m gonna help them.<U+2019> She<U+2019>s a total hypocrite.<U+201D> Trump slammed the alleged <U+201C>hypocrisy of the media and our politicians.<U+201D> <U+201C>They condemned my words, but they ignore and defend the reprehens<U+2014> and this is the way it is <U+2014> the reprehensible actions of Hillary and Bill Clinton that have destroyed and hurt so many lives.<U+201D> He also blasted Hillary Clinton for defending a man who allegedly raped then-12-year-old Kathy Shelton. <U+201C>As the lawyer for the rapist, Hillary Clinton said the little girl was emotionally unstable and had a <U+2014> quote <U+2014> tendency to seek out older men and engage in fantasizing. Hillary ruined that young girl<U+2019>s life,<U+201D> Trump said. <U+201C>Destroyed her life, and years later she was recorded laughing about it on videotape. She was laughing at the girl.<U+201D> While the notion that Clinton was laughing at Shelton has been debunked, Trump added: <U+201C>There<U+2019>s nothing Hillary Clinton won<U+2019>t do or say to obtain power, and it<U+2019>s about time people started to understand that. But the hypocrites in the media don<U+2019>t wanna talk about what Hillary Clinton has done to these victims. They don<U+2019>t wanna talk about what their other political heroes have done to other innocent girls and women.<U+201D> By Thomas Wright By Bill Scher By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

To the Editor: Re <U+201C> The Death of Idealism <U+201D> (column, Sept. 30): David Brooks writes that <U+201C>this boomer-versus-boomer campaign has decimated idealism.<U+201D> Hillary Clinton, as she herself has admitted, is not a natural politician. Yes, in her speeches <U+201C>the poetic, aspirational quality is entirely absent<U+201D> and she <U+201C>fails to make an emotional connection.<U+201D> But no, that does not mean that she has lost her idealism. Mrs. Clinton became a fiery social activist in college, where she led protests to increase African-American admissions to Wellesley. As first lady she worked for universal health care; when her idealism hit Washington reality she persisted, helping to gain health care coverage for children. As a senator from New York she worked across the aisle, compromising and gaining the respect of her Republican colleagues. After being defeated in the 2008 Democratic primaries, she worked as secretary of state to extend American ideals around the world. For myself, an older baby boomer, I would like to think that, while I have scaled back my immediate goals as I have become more pragmatic and realistic, I have retained the idealism and humanity that determine my long-term goals. And I would like to think that of Hillary Clinton. ALLAN D. GREENBERG Scarsdale, N.Y. To the Editor: David Brooks has succumbed to the cynicism and distrust that he decries in his dismissal of the two leading presidential candidates. He apparently listens to Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s campaign with selective inattentiveness to her appeals to idealistic principles and the common good <U+2014> <U+201C>the higher angels of our nature.<U+201D> And how is it that her extensive, informed familiarity with governmental policy amounts to <U+201C>an arid hodgepodge<U+201D> of uninspiring details, offered merely out of political self-interest? Perhaps Mr. Brooks should turn to the question of why informational substance receives such short shrift in American politics. The visionary <U+201C>uplift<U+201D> of shining cities on hills comes cheap. More deserving of public respect is a foundation of historically steeped, nuts-and-bolts competence in governance on which to construct such a city. A firm insistence by the media that politicians display in-depth knowledge, fact-based realism and astute judgment <U+2014> while eschewing empty sloganism and easy campaign promises <U+2014> would be a real show of idealism. To comment negatively on both contestants, albeit more scathingly on Donald Trump, is to suggest equivalent undesirability <U+2014> a journalistic disservice given the extreme hazard embodied in the Republican nominee. A. ROSS HILL Brooklyn To the Editor: David Brooks<U+2019>s lament about Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s loss of her 1960s idealism all too easily fits into his conservative worldview. I offered the invocation at the Wellesley graduation at which she gave her famous speech in 1969. I knew her well in those days. Even then her <U+2019>60s idealism was well tempered by a Niebuhrian realism. She has not changed fundamentally since then. On the one hand, in those days she was a devout, churchgoing Methodist who believed that we should <U+201C>do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, for all the people you can.<U+201D> On the other hand, she is firmly convinced, as she was at Wellesley, that politics is the art of the possible. At Wellesley, she was by no means some head-in-the clouds student radical. She was both idealistic and realistic, and so she remains today, which was and is an ethical complexity that Mr. Brooks apparently does not take with full seriousness. (Rev.) H. PAUL SANTMIRE Watertown, Mass. To the Editor: While I agree with David Brooks<U+2019>s assessment of Donald Trump<U+2019>s dismal character, I find it unfortunate that he falls into the typical, widely identified trap of setting up a moral equivalence between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton: <U+201C>There is an entire absence, in both campaigns, of any effort to appeal to the higher angels of our nature.<U+201D> Really? Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s calling for paid sick leave, better health care for children, debt-free college opportunities, and working together as a diverse society is equivalent to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s race-baiting, calls for stop-and-frisk and law and order, and vilification of immigrants? Mr. Brooks clearly fails to hear what Mrs. Clinton is actually saying. He should have found a way to frame his arguments without resorting to the tired and dangerously inaccurate equalization of the two candidates<U+2019> shortcomings. JEFFREY SCHIFF Brooklyn To the Editor: I invite David Brooks to picture Hillary Clinton in the Oval Office vetoing bill after bill passed by a Republican-controlled Congress (which is what the polls are projecting) <U+2014> legislation abolishing the Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, gutting Medicare and Social Security, abolishing voter rights, abolishing financial controls on Wall Street, sweeping away women<U+2019>s and gender rights, diluting freedom of choice for women <U+2026> the list is endless. If Republicans control the presidency and Congress, 70 years of progress will hang from the thin thread of the filibuster rule, which is not constitutionally protected. Does anyone care if her veto is inspirational? Does anyone care if she smiles? It<U+2019>s her actions, not her speaking style or demeanor, that count. This is not about quibbles over Mr. Brooks<U+2019>s failure to recognize false equivalencies. Americans need to wake up and consider what they might be on the verge of doing. ROBERT MILLSAP Woodland, Calif. To the Editor: l am sick and tired of naysayers like David Brooks who are not sufficiently inspired, uplifted or moved by Hillary Clinton. She is being held to a totally different standard than that applied to any other candidate <U+2014> in this or any other presidential contest. If she articulates specific policies or proposals, she is a <U+201C>policy wonk.<U+201D> If she has the inner strength to admit mistakes (unlike her opponent), she is untrustworthy. The woman has a wealth of experience, sound judgment, international respect and an incredible work ethic. She has articulated a vision of a more fair, just and inclusive society, and has given the specifics of how to achieve it. David Brooks and his holier-than-thou ilk are not only unfair in their assessment of her, but they also act as if they are unaware of the consequences of this dismissive, condescending portrayal, which is to actively encourage those who will either sit this election out or vote for a third-party candidate.

In the clip, she asks whether mainstream media is complicit in violence within prisons because they only cover prison resistance when it turns violent, ignoring non-violent resistance like the current strike. Kumars and Roqayah discuss this point and brainstorm ways to get around this sad reality.\nNext, Kumars interviews <U+201C>D<U+201D>, the incarcerated strike leader from South Carolina who we spoke to in our last episode. Kumars gets an update from D about conditions on the ground where he is, and the repression he and others have faced as they keep their strike alive. Importantly, D discusses the lasting changes in terms of prisoner consciousness and solidarity he already sees, and discusses next steps for this movement which will not end until prisons as we currently know them cease to exist.\n\nIf you want to learn more or get involved:\nDonate to IWOC to support striking prisoners\nWrite letters to incarcerated strike leaders facing repression \nBoycott products made with prison slave labor \nCall prisons to tell them to meet prisoner demands and halt repression \nBail out arrested prison strike supporters \nFree Alabama Movement \nIWOC Facebook page \nPrison strike timeline and other useful information \nStrike tracking state-by-state \nAlso, email iwoc@riseup.net to get involved with an IWOC chapter near you!\nFollow Azzurra Crispino on twitter at @LibertyHerbert and IWOC at @IWW_IWOC .\nThe post Delete Your Account <U+2013> Episode 18: Prison Strike Update appeared first on Shadowproof .\n",

Elijah Cummings (D-MD) was the ranking minority member on the House Benghazi committee, so he knows firsthand how Republican witch-hunts work from up close personal experience. \nOn CNN<U+2019>s New Day this morning, he revealed the real motivation behind the FBI Director<U+2019>s stunningly improper memo to Congress last week. \n<U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think the American people have a clue how hard the Republicans <U+2013> particularly on my committee <U+2013> have been on the FBI. This is a man <U+2013> Director Comey <U+2013> who they loved. They said he was the greatest thing in the world, very honorable.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>When he came out with the decision in July to not prosecute Mrs. Clinton, they suddenly turned against him. He knows that if he makes any misstep, the Republicans are going to be all over him and they<U+2019>re going to try and bring harm to him. The thing that he did say in our hearing, and it stuck with me, is that <U+2018>there should not be a double standard to the disadvantage of Mrs. Clinton.'<U+201D> \nThat<U+2019>s right, it is heavily implied that the FBI Director was so intimidated by Congressional Republicans and their innuendo machines that he caved in and fed them the kind of vaguely worded red meat memo the Trump campaign desperately needed to keep their failing campaign on life support. \nEven Comey himself admitted that his memo was going to be widely misinterpreted , which is probably why CNN<U+2019>s host began her interview with Congressman Cummings by saying, <U+201C>Trump is lying about the email probe.<U+201D> \nIt hasn<U+2019>t taken long for the roof to cave in on Comey<U+2019>s career anyway, as his obvious meddling in the election has drawn bipartisan complaints about illegal electioneering by the FBI Director, his former boss to condemn his actions and for the Senate minority leader Harry Reid to demand answers from the FBI about the Republican candidate<U+2019>s love affair with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Reid<U+2019>s point was not lost on the Congressman from Maryland who told CNN: \n<U+201C>There has been a lot of information out there about Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort and the Russian government and alleged attempts to take over our election. Members of Congress have asked for months, for the FBI to provide us with information if Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort and any elements of the Russian government have any coordination or connection with each other.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>They have not given us one syllable. So the question here is: Do we have a double standard here?<U+201D> \nOf course there<U+2019>s a double standard! \nThe FBI has a responsibility to keep certain things secret, and when it comes to partisan elections that responsibility is key to the ability of our electoral democracy<U+2019>s basic functioning. Newsweek<U+2019>s Kurt Eichenwald pointed out cogently that Republican George W. Bush was investigated by the FBI in 1996, prior to running for President. Yet, the Clinton White House didn<U+2019>t grab his FBI file and air all of the dirty laundry claiming a very partisan need for transparency during an election. Otherwise, the FBI could decide to influence every election in America, and over time the FBI would pick the elected officials to their liking. \nNothing can un-ring the bell that FBI Director Comey struck by letting loose his vague memo, but everyone can understand there is a sexist, partisan and blatant double standard at play by Republicans celebrating a vague memo, which only happened because an official sworn to be non-partisan decided he valued his political career more than the integrity of our electoral system \nWatch it here:",

The acknowledgment resolves the mystery of why Mr. Assange<U+2019>s internet link was severed on Saturday.

WikiLeaks said Tuesday on Twitter that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had asked Ecuadorean officials to stop Mr. Assange from publishing more of the Clinton emails. The State Department has denied pressuring Ecuador, and the Ecuadorean government said its foreign policy decisions aren<U+2019>t influenced by pressure from other states. Mr. Assange<U+2019>s predicament is unique because his origins and activities cut across at least six countries. He was born in Australia, lives now at Ecuador<U+2019>s U.K. embassy, is publishing documents allegedly stolen by Russia that affect the U.S. election, and is being pursued by law enforcement in Sweden over sexual-assault allegations that Mr. Assange denies. Ecuador has signaled that it would continue to grant Mr. Assange asylum, but the Foreign Relations Ministry statement suggests he would be treated differently. <U+201C>Ecuador has exercised its sovereign right to temporarily restrict access to some of its private communications network within its Embassy in the United Kingdom,<U+201D> the ministry said. <U+201C>This temporary restriction does not prevent the WikiLeaks organization from carrying out its journalistic activities.<U+201D> WikiLeaks gained international attention in 2006 when it published cables that detailed the inner workings of U.S. foreign policy. It regained global attention in recent months with the publication of emails stolen from top Democratic Party officials. In July, days before the Democratic National Convention, it published more than 19,000 emails believed stolen from the Democratic Party, some sufficiently embarrassing to prompt the resignation of top party officials. Earlier this month, WikiLeaks published a new batch of emails, several thousand a day, revealing messages apparently sent and received by top Clinton aide John Podesta. The organization is expected to continue releasing thousands of additional Podesta emails in the days leading up to the election. The Clinton campaign has accused Russia of stealing the emails and then having WikiLeaks post them, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing the case. The Clinton campaign has declined to confirm whether the emails are authentic. U.S. intelligence agencies have said the publication of these emails by WikiLeaks represented a key part of a well-orchestrated campaign by top Russian officials to interfere in the U.S. election.",

Those who expected Donald Trump to quit with the zany tweets in the interest of becoming more <U+201C>presidential<U+201D> have been disappointed (or relieved, depending on taste). He<U+2019>s perhaps slowed his pace a bit, but the hits keep on coming. Here<U+2019>s his latest , this morning: <U+201C>Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag<U+2014>if they do, there must be consequences<U+2014>perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!<U+201D> Follow James on Twitter We<U+2019>re going to take that literally and rebut it, but only because we enjoy writing about constitutional law. The U.S. Supreme Court held in Texas v. Johnson (1989), and reaffirmed in U.S. v. Eichman (1990) that burning the American flag is a form of symbolic speech, protected by the First Amendment. True, both rulings were 5-4, and the entire court has turned over since then except Justice Anthony Kennedy (who was in the majority). But we doubt very much the justices would overturn these precedents. Not only is the current court generally friendlier to free-speech claims than the 1989-90 court was, but a generation has gone by without any evident diminution of respect for the flag. As Justice William Brennan observed in Johnson: Trump critics have taken particular offense at his suggestion that flag-burners be stripped of U.S. citizenship. But the suggestion is frivolous. No one can be stripped of U.S. citizenship, possibly excepting someone whose naturalization rested on fraud. ( Ari Fleischer , White House press secretary to George W. Bush, offers a mischievous compromise proposal: <U+201C>I disagree because it<U+2019>s a free speech right for Americans, but any non-citizen who burns the flag should not be allowed to become a citizen.<U+201D>) Two days ago, amid the futile recall effort of Green Jill Stein, Trump tweeted : <U+201C>In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.<U+201D> We would fault him for the phrase <U+201C>won the popular vote,<U+201D> because the aggregate national popular vote is a meaningless statistic. To say he (or Hillary Clinton) <U+201C>won<U+201D> it is as meaningful as saying the Denver Broncos <U+201C>won the total yardage<U+201D> on Sunday night, when they were losing to the Kansas City Chiefs 30-27 in overtime. But what stirred most of the interest was the factual underpinning of his tweet<U+2014>or, more likely, the lack thereof. It was widely assumed that Trump<U+2019>s <U+201C>three million<U+201D> came from Alex Jones of the right-wing conspiracy site Infowars.com, who claimed two weeks ago that <U+201C>three million votes in the U.S. presidential election were cast by illegal aliens.<U+201D> One reason to regard that assertion as dubious is that it specifically mentions illegal aliens. All aliens, regardless of legal status, are prohibited from voting in federal elections. We wondered if there was any reliable estimate of the number of aliens (or ineligible citizens) who voted. The answer appears to be no. PolitiFact did a <U+201C>fact check<U+201D> on Jones<U+2019>s assertion and rated it <U+201C>false,<U+201D> even though checker Allison Graves acknowledged <U+201C>we don<U+2019>t know for absolute certain.<U+201D> Graves makes a reasonable case that the three million figure is so high as to be implausible on its face. But she cites what looks like agenda-driven <U+201C>research<U+201D> producing numbers that seem implausibly low: A 2014 paper by a trio of political scientists from Virginia<U+2019>s Old Dominion and George Mason universities noted that <U+201C>very little reliable data exists concerning the frequency with which non-citizen immigrants participate in United States election.<U+201D> Their estimate of alien votes in 2008: <U+201C>from just over 38,000 at the very minimum to nearly 2.8 million at the maximum.<U+201D> To say the least, that is not very precise. Anyhow, who cares? Trump won the election, after all, so why quibble over the <U+201C>popular vote<U+201D>? His tweet prompted the closest thing we<U+2019>ve ever seen to a witty headline on the young-adult website Vox : <U+201C>Donald Trump Is Now Questioning the Legitimacy of the Election He Won.<U+201D> Top Voxen Ezra Klein observes in the piece: <U+201C>Back in March, I wrote a piece about how Trump was too gullible<U+2014>too fond of bad information and sycophants<U+2014>to be president. I think that piece holds up.<U+201D> Well, maybe<U+2014>except the part about being president! Of course Trump isn<U+2019>t actually questioning the legitimacy of the election, just quibbling over a meaningless stat. But why does he persist with the crazy tweets? Maybe he can<U+2019>t help himself, but even that doesn<U+2019>t preclude the possibility that there<U+2019>s method to the madness. For one thing, the outrage it draws provides opportunities to highlight Trump<U+2019>s critics<U+2019> hypocrisy. Example: After the flag-burning tweet provoked vigorous defenses of the First Amendment, many people pointed out that then-Sen. Clinton was a lead sponsor of the Flag Protection Act of 2005 . And of course her lukewarm endorsement of the Stein recount effort occasioned many reminders of how aghast Mrs. Clinton was when Trump refused to commit to accept the outcome of the election she was supposed to win. For another, it confuses antagonistic journalists. It draws attention away from consequential stories that might be awkward or damaging to Trump, such as the potential conflicts of interest posed by his businesses. Last night we noted this Twitter exchange between Harry Siegel and Josh Greenman, respectively a columnist and the opinion editor of New York<U+2019>s Daily News: We interjected with a link to a Columbia Journalism Review piece titled <U+201C>The Goal Is Not to Fear Trump, but for Trump to Fear You.<U+201D> The <U+201C>you<U+201D> is journalists, and something tells us that goal is far from realization. By the way, did CJR ever run a piece like that about Barack Obama? From <U+201C> we begin bombing in five minutes <U+201D> to <U+201C> the Cambridge police acted stupidly ,<U+201D> presidents have been bedeviled by <U+201C>gaffes.<U+201D> It<U+2019>s possible Trump has come up with a way of neutralizing the risk<U+2014>by making odd statements so often that they<U+2019>ll eventually stop making news. In the best-case scenario he<U+2019>ll help restore the balance of power in government by making fools of those who hang on the president<U+2019>s every word. And if nothing else, it<U+2019>s entertaining. Charles Murray of the American Enterprise Institute<U+2014>perhaps the most intensely anti-Trump person we encountered all year, which is saying a lot <U+2014>tweeted this morning: <U+201C>An ignoble confession: The next day<U+2019>s news if Hillary had won would have been so depressing.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Activist Post \n source: activistpost.com \n text: By John Vibes \nIn the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war. \nNATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters , thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks. \nIt was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russia<U+2019>s border. \nOn Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia<U+2019>s borders as part of a huge military deployment. \nA total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russia<U+2019>s borders since the Cold War. \nIn addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time. \nThe US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a <U+201C>deterrent<U+201D> to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war. \n<U+201C>This is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict,<U+201D> NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday <U+2014> ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation. \nJust imagine what would happen if Russian troops amassed along the Mexican border and told the US that this move was to <U+2018>prevent conflict.<U+2019> \nThe so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. \nThe United States<U+2019> envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATO<U+2019>s deployment. This statement is insane considering the fact that the US military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone else<U+2019>s lands. \n<U+201C>This deployment, if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russia<U+2019>s) security posture,<U+201D> Lute said. \nIf anyone is a threat, it is NATO and the US government. \nThese military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in Syria, in which Western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups. Meanwhile, Russia has interests in keeping their allies in the Syrian government in control, putting the two superpowers at odds. \nUntil now, Russia and the US have been fighting through third parties, just as they had during the previous Cold War, and the same type of situation is developing today. \nJohn Vibes is an author and researcher who organizes a number of large events including the Free Your Mind Conference.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Byron Tau \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-coordinated-on-clinton-email-issues-new-documents-show-1475798310 \n text: WASHINGTON<U+2014>Newly disclosed emails show top Obama administration officials were in close contact with Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s nascent presidential campaign in early 2015 about the potential fallout from revelations that the former secretary of state used a private email server. Their discussion included a request from the White House communications director to her counterpart at the State Department to see if it was possible to arrange for Secretary of State John Kerry to avoid questions during media appearances about Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s email arrangement. In another instance, a top State Department official assured an attorney for Mrs. Clinton that, contrary to media reports, a department official hadn<U+2019>t told Congress that Mrs. Clinton erred in using a private email account . The previously unreported emails were obtained by the Republican National Committee as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit seeking records of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s time in office. The RNC provided to The Wall Street Journal only some of the emails, leaving it unclear what was in the remaining documents. The RNC said it released only emails relevant to the communication between the White House and State Department. Meredith McGehee, chief of policy, programs, and strategy at the nonpartisan advocacy group Issue One and an expert on ethics and campaign finance, said the email exchange would probably raise no legal concerns because federal law permits members of the White House staff to engage in some political activity. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s email arrangement has dogged her campaign for months , with Republicans and other critics saying it shows a carelessness with government secrets and undermines her claim to good judgment. Donald Trump <U+2019>s campaign posted a statement on his website last month saying the Obama White House knew Mrs. Clinton was using a private email server. Mrs. Clinton has acknowledged the arrangement was a mistake, but she has rejected the notion that national secrets were placed at risk. Her campaign didn<U+2019>t respond to a request for comment about the new email disclosures. The emails highlight the revolving door between the State Department, the White House and the Clinton campaign in early 2015 as Mrs. Clinton geared up to run for president. The New York Times reported on March 2, 2015, that Mrs. Clinton had exclusively used a private email account for government business when she was secretary of state. That set off months of controversy for Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign, culminating in a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe that recommended against prosecution of Mrs. Clinton. At the time of the initial report, Mrs. Clinton hadn<U+2019>t formally declared her intention to mount a presidential campaign, but she had begun hiring staff ahead of her formal announcement on April 12, 2015. Ten days after the story broke, White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri emailed State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki to ask, <U+201C>between us on the shows<U+2026>think we can get this done so he is not asked about email.<U+201D> That apparently referred to Mr. Kerry, who appeared in an interview on CBS <U+2019>s <U+201C>Face the Nation<U+201D> three days later. Ms. Palmieri had previously announced she would be leaving the administration to join Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign in mid-2015, but was still at the White House when she sent the email. Other emails show Ms. Palmieri helped arrange for Ms. Psaki to move from the State Department to the White House communications job Ms. Palmieri was vacating. <U+201C>Agree completely and working to crush on my end,<U+201D> wrote back Ms. Psaki, who would move to the White House weeks later. A day later, Ms. Psaki added, <U+201C>Good to go on killing CBS idea.<U+201D> She continued, <U+201C>And we are going to hold on any other TV options just given the swirl of crap out there.<U+201D> Mr. Kerry wasn<U+2019>t asked on CBS about the email server, though it isn<U+2019>t clear how Ms. Psaki could have guaranteed that. Teased by Ms. Palmieri about her use of the phrase <U+201C>swirl of crap,<U+201D> Ms. Psaki wrote back: <U+201C>Ha I mean<U+2014>the challenging stories out there.<U+201D> CBS spokeswoman Caitlin Conant said the network had made no commitments about what questions Mr. Kerry would face. <U+201C>No subject was off-limits when this interview was arranged, as is the CBS News standard,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>CBS News<U+2019> State Department correspondent was in Egypt with Secretary John Kerry in the home stretch of the Iran nuclear deal negotiations and discussed policy issues of the day with him on this official trip.<U+201D> State Department spokesman John Kirby added that there was nothing unusual about the Palmieri-Psaki exchange. <U+201C>It is common practice for State Department and White House staffers to be in touch when agency officials are potentially conducting television interviews,<U+201D> he said. The RNC also obtained an entirely redacted discussion between nearly a dozen top White House communications officials with a subject line referring to Mr. Kerry<U+2019>s appearance on CBS. A White House official said the internal debate at the time was about whether Mr. Kerry should appear on the shows at all, rather than any attempt to influence what questions were asked. In another email coming from the State Department, Patrick Kennedy, the undersecretary for management, told Heather Samuelson, one of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s attorneys, about new documents the State Department had posted concerning the former secretary of state. Ms. Samuelson was one of the attorneys who reviewed Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s emails to determine which were government-related and which were personal before providing the official ones to the State Department. She was interviewed by the FBI as part of its probe and granted limited immunity in exchange for turning over her laptop as part of the investigation. In another exchange, Mr. Kennedy told Ms. Samuelson that Politico was <U+201C>running [a] story that State official said Secretary Clinton did wrong thing. Wildly inaccurate reporting.<U+201D> A Politico spokesman said the organization stood by its reporting. The story reported that Joyce Barr, assistant secretary of state for administration, had said in testimony to Congress that Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s record-keeping practices were <U+201C>not acceptable.<U+201D> An internal watchdog report later concluded that Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s email use wasn't permitted under State policy. Mr. Kirby, the State Department spokesman, said Mr. Kennedy was <U+201C>simply offering a reaction to a press article.<U+201D> He added it wasn<U+2019>t unusual for State officials to be in contact with former secretaries or their staff. Corrections & Amplifications: The New York Times reported on March 2, 2015 that Hillary Clinton used a private email account for all her government business. An earlier version of this story said the newspaper had reported she used a private email server, a fact that was reported days later by a different news outlet.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Yves Smith \n source: nakedcapitalism.com \n text: by Yves Smith \nWith all the big and small grifting that goes on in private equity, we haven<U+2019>t bothered calling out a practice that is pervasive and well known in the private equity community and authorized by the agreements that the limited partners sign with the general partners. Yet it will likely stick in the craw of most public pension fund beneficiaries, the taxpayers who support the payments to those plans, as well as donor to foundations and endowments that also invest in private equity even more than the widespread use of private jets, which is authorized not just for firm employees but at some general partners, even their family members. \nAnother routine form of private equity rent extraction is how they get the fund investors, who are fiduciaries, to pay for lavish annual conferences which for the biggest funds includes big ticket entertainment like Elton John: #EltonJohn <U+2014> TPG CEO Conference Phoenix AZ pic.twitter.com/gQWqkpPEwO \n<U+2014> Doug Curling (@shakadoug) October 19, 2016 \nAnd for the still skeptical, another source has confirmed that Elton John performed at the TPG conference. And as is typical in limited partnership agreements, investors are on the hook for the costs of <U+201C>meetings<U+201D> and this show, as part of a limited partner event, was on their nickel. \nThe only TPG limited partnership agreement we have is for a credit fund, and debt investors (unless they obtain control of a company via Chapter 11 or an out of court restructuring) do not have direct control over portfolio companies. That makes it harder for them to keep various charges opaque to limited partners by laundering them through portfolio companies. Nevertheless, the TPG Opportunities Partners II (A) puts the cost of meetings squarely on the investors. From numbered page 42, section 6.01(b): \nExcept as specifically set forth in Section 3.01 ofthe Management Agreement, the Partnership shall pay for (or shall reimburse the Management Company for its payment of) all fees, costs and expenses relating to the Partnership<U+2019>s activities, operations, meetings (including Advisory Committee meetings)<U+2026> \nAnd TPG<U+2019>s current Form ADV is even clearer on this point : \n<U+2026>each Fund also generally bears all of the expenses relating to its activities, operations, meetings and eventual liquidation (other than expenses resulting from the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of us or its general partner), \nAnd the ADV also specifies that TPG can charge entertainment to portfolio companies, which means limited partners have no idea how large the charges are in total: \n<U+2026>reimbursements from portfolio companies for expenses (including travel expenses, which include expenses for business or first class travel, <U+201C>black car<U+201D> transportation and meals (including late night meals consumed at times when not traveling), entertainment-related expenses) we incur in connection with our performance of services for such portfolio company; \nConsider what this means. Private jet use supposedly OK not because it is an egregious perk for Masters of the Universe, but because their time is oh-so-valuable, and sometimes those mere commercial flights don<U+2019>t get from Awkward Point A to Awkward Point B all that efficiently. The other justification is the need for secrecy and the ability to work on a private jet. The latter claim is pretty dodgy in light of the widespread industry practice of offering empty seats to supposed competitors if they happen to need a lift. So private jet use is an occasionally-justifible practice that has become a bad norm. \nBy contrast, it<U+2019>s hard to see lavish entertainment at supposed informational gatherings as anything other than a kickback to private equity investors. As someone who is in the business of consuming and analyzing information, it is vastly more efficient to process written information than speeches or presentations. Lambert and I both greatly prefer transcripts and can barely stand the time cost of listening to Web presentations. Conferences are an even bigger time sink. \nIn other words, if the objective were to inform investors, these events are clearly not necessary. The limited partners are flattering themselves if they think they can learn anything more by seeing general partner execs or the team from their showcased portfolio companies in the flesh. These are all highly skilled performers and these events are very carefully staged in advance. \nSo what are the limited partners getting? Aside from getting an excuse to visit New York, London, Phoenix, or other major destination, and getting wined and dined, the general partners are marketing to them. This is an extended sales pitch to help groom them to invest in the next fund. And secondarily, it<U+2019>s an opportunity to mix socially with other limited partners<U+2026>which is questionable as a use of the funds entrusted to them. They can do that just as well at educational conferences, which are also neutral territory. \nIndeed, a former private equity fund executive pointed out that keeping private equity staff at pension funds and foundations busy with the nominally important work of running around to general partner meet and greets seriously eroded the time they could spend doing what ought to be their real work, of reading the financial information and other reports provided by the general partners as well as their SEC Form ADVs, which it appears virtually no one in the industry bothers scrutinizing. \nOne academic told me that he<U+2019>d only encountered one investor who regularly read the IPOs of companies sold out of funds they<U+2019>d invested in to see if there was anything they hadn<U+2019>t anticipated so as to help them better evaluate future fund investments. Consistent with the thesis that general partner conferences were either by accident or design busywork to keep limited partners from digging into documents and data, this investor was in a remote part of Europe and didn<U+2019>t often go to investor confabs because the travel time was apparently too costly relative to the information yield. \nOne has to wonder how popular these general partner conferences would be if they instead featured rubber-chicken dinners and focused on information conveyance. The INET conferences, which by contrast are primarily networking events, featured long days (8 AM to 10 PM, with the lunch and dinner speakers covering substantive topics) for years until the participants cried uncle and asked for a less exhausting schedule. And these are people who don<U+2019>t have billions of dollars of funds at risk. \nIt<U+2019>s not hard to imagine that if the general partners were dispensing information, as opposed to using investor monies to curry favor with them, you<U+2019>d see them using tried and true forms, like public company quarterly earnings calls. But as people trained in making presentations know, conventions like a darkened room, the use of visuals on screens, having speakers on daises, all give the speakers a power advantage over the audience and deter questions. A conference call would be a dangerous leveler. Can<U+2019>t have that, now can we? \nSo expect this offensive form of grifting to continue. The old saying at CalPERS more than a decade ago was that the price of a $100 million commitment was a steak dinner. Imagine what seeing Elton John perform live buys. 0 0 0 0 0 2",

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo \nTwenty six black Christian leaders have issued Hillary Clinton a powerful letter regarding religious freedom, education, unemployment, abortion and violence decimating their communities. (VERO BEACH, FL) Black leaders slammed Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s position toward the poor in a letter delivered to her campaign Monday, saying her economic ideas won<U+2019>t help black communities in crisis and that her social views pose a threat to their religious liberty. \n<U+201C>Today in the United States more than ten million people of African descent face a crisis of catastrophic proportion,<U+201D> it says. <U+201C>As leaders of the Pentecostal-Charismatic wing of the black church, we are requesting a meeting with you to discuss some of the critical issues in the black community: education and employment, religious freedom, violence, and justice for the unborn.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>How do you justify your unconscionable silence in the face of such destruction of innocent black life? Don<U+2019>t black lives matter?<U+201D> they ask Clinton about abortion. \nThey continue : \nSecretary Clinton, we are also very concerned about your position regarding unborn children and the black church<U+2019>s commitment to defend them. In April 2015 in a speech before the National Organization of Women you stated <U+201C>Far too many women are still denied critical access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth<U+2026> Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will. And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed<U+2026><U+201D> \nFor political leaders to call for changes in citizens<U+2019> beliefs is reminiscent of totalitarianism. In our view, such a proposal constitutes a denial of our religious freedom. \nThe vast majority of black churches hold biblical teaching, which is eternal, as authoritative for doctrine and practice. Abortion is the deliberate destruction of a human life in its most vulnerable state. Biblical principle and natural law, both of which prohibit the taking of innocent human life, compel our concern about the increasing moral complicity with abortion. \nFor the same reasons that we as black Christian leaders oppose racism, unjust wars, capital punishment and euthanasia, we oppose the violent denial of life to the unborn through abortion. It is our view that human life is a gift of God that we are called upon to protect, nurture and sustain, because we are created in God<U+2019>s image. Therefore, our opposition to abortion is a logical outgrowth of our view that there must be justice for all. \nParticularly relevant is the innocence of the unborn child. The Bible places an extremely high value on human life and particularly on the lives of the innocent who are under the special protection of God. Those who take the life of the innocent violate a key biblical principle as well as a fundamental principle of natural justice. \nAbortion in the black community has had a catastrophic impact. Nationally there are 365 black babies aborted for every 1,000 that are born. Blacks account for roughly 38% of all abortions in the country though we represent only 13% of the population. In New York City, the situation is absolutely dire. \nAccording to a report prepared by the city<U+2019>s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, in 2013 there were more abortions among black women in the city, 29,007, than there were black babies born, 24,108. Both nationally and in New York City, the abortion rates among black women are much higher than among any other demographic group. (This claim has been fact-checked by Politifact and deemed to be accurate.) In New York City more black babies are dying in their mother<U+2019>s womb than are being born. \nIn 2008, Secretary Clinton, you took the position that abortion should be rare, and you emphasized <U+201C>by rare I mean rare.<U+201D> But Black babies are dying at terrifying rates. \nHow do you justify your unconscionable silence in the face of such destruction of innocent black life? Don<U+2019>t black lives matter? What policies would you pursue as president to reverse the soaring abortion rates among black women? \nOn Monday afternoon, Dr. Jacqueline C. Rivers presented the letter to Clinton<U+2019>s Brooklyn campaign headquarters requesting a meeting. \nSignatures to the letter: Presiding Bishop Charles E.

Edward Herman is an exception, a genuine man of the Left. He says <U+201C>a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia.<U+201D> Clinton Is the Most Dangerous Person Alive <U+2013> An Interview with Edward S. Herman by Ann Garrison \n<U+201C> The election of Hillary Clinton might threaten a democratic order as much as a Trump victory.<U+201D> \nAnn Garrison: Earlier this year, you told me that you differ with Noam Chomsky, your co-author of Manufacturing Consent and other books, in that you plan to vote for the Green Party's presidential and vice presidential candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka in the swing state of Pennsylvania. Are you still planning to do so? \nEdward S. Herman: Yes. \nAG: Can you explain why? \nESH: Because the two duopoly candidates are dangerous to societal and international welfare and even survival. Hillary Clinton is a neo-liberal and pre-eminent war-monger. I think she is the most dangerous person living in the world today, given her highly likely election victory and her likely performance as president. She represents the corporate elite and military-industrial complex more clearly than Trump and she is a follow-on to Bush and Obama. She will pursue similar policies except for her somewhat more aggressive bent. \nTrump is a self-promoting windbag, racist and dangerous, unpredictable phony. We have a ghastly choice in these two. Jill Stein offers a protest opportunity, more so than not voting. On the line that either voting for Stein or not voting would constitute a vote for Trump, one might argue that a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia and a vote for Netanyahu (and hence for escalated violence in Palestine). \nAG: Hillary Clinton and John Podesta's e-mail has revealed that Hillary Clinton is well aware that the Saudi and Qatari rulers - not rogue elements - fund ISIS, and the same Saudi and Qatari rulers fund the Clinton Foundation. Throughout the last George Bush's presidency, there were innumerable headlines that \"Saudi oil sheikhs met with George Bush on his Crawford, Texas ranch.\" What are your thoughts on that? \nESH: Saudi Arabia is a US ally and an instrument of the warfare state. Hillary Clinton has treated its leaders warmly and she will continue to do so as president. The Clinton Foundation's receipt of money from Saudi and Qatari leaders is a first class conflict of interest and outrage, but the media have focused on the many less important abuses of Trump, helping cover over the outrages of their preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, Bill Clinton. \nAG: What do you think of Clinton's statement that she would make removing Bashar Al-Assad her top priority? And Trump's statement that he would not, because that would recklessly risk confrontation with Russia? \nESH: Hillary Clinton has essentially promised to escalate war in Syria and is therefore promising to go to war with Russia as well. Diana Johnstone has made the case that Hillary Clinton plans to try to bring about \"regime change\" in Russia (cite). This is of course incredibly dangerous and would have aroused a really democratic media, but the existing media are part of the war system, hence Hillary Clinton's commitment to wars is essentially suppressed. Trump has made a number of statements along the lines of reducing US interventions and commitments abroad and trying to deal with Russia in a less confrontational manner, but he has sometimes contradicted himself by urging expanded arms, use of nuclear weapons, etc. But Hillary Clinton has said nothing that would offset her war-mongering. This difference from Trump may help explain the intensity of media hostility to Trump. \nAG: Jill Stein has said that \"wars for oil are blowing back at us wth a vengeance\" and that she would cut the military budget by half, close most of the foreign bases, and redirect resources into a Green New Deal that would fully employ Americans building sustainable energy and agricultural infrastructure. I can't imagine you disagree, but do you think it's important for the Greens to articulate such a vision at the national and international level, instead of focusing solely on local races that they might win? \nESH: The Greens don't have the resources to compete in many local elections. So she is wise to focus on the big national and international issues. Furthermore, the real gap in the political system is the lack of opposition to national neoliberal and militaristic policies. It is said that she can't make a bigger mark given the hegemony of the duopoly, but even Ralph Nader couldn't get 5 percent of the vote. The system still works well, for the 1%. \nAG : Michael Moore has made a movie called \"Trumpland\" and warned that Trump's election would be the end of the United States , assuming that would be a bad thing. David Swanson, author of \"War Is a Lie,\" has imagined the same but argued, in \" Secession, Trump, and the Avoidability of Civil War ,\" that the break-up of the United States is not the worst possibility on the horizon.

It<U+2019>s box office baby. \nThe 9/11 memorial was sad, but not as sad as Alvarez will be when I crash land a jumbo left hook in the seemingly structurally sound facade of a face. He will come crashing down. It will be an inside job, because he prepares like a chump. \nMy focus remains on the battle ahead in Madison Square Gardens but I was thrown off my preparation when I learned there is no garden. It<U+2019>s just a big fuck off arena forged out of metal for the fighting God. I would say Gods, but there is only one, me, Notorious. \nI had anticipated doing my movement training with grass beneath my feet, so I headed to Central Park. It ain<U+2019>t got a patch on Phoenix Park. I wouldn<U+2019>t be the fighter I am today without Dublin<U+2019>s back garden. Chasing the deer as a nipper helped me hone my quickness, my agility. \nI studied the deer and the stag; their movements. So don<U+2019>t be surprised if I enter the octagon with four hooves and antlers. I will do anything, all it takes to win. Anyway, back to the tour, I hear they filmed some Sex and the City shit in Central Park. \nNo Sex in the City for Alvarez, though. He couldn<U+2019>t score in a brothel above Coppers with 20gs in his pocket. What I am saying is that my opponent is challenged in the face department. His head is like a melted lasagne left out in the sun for weeks. Not even Donald Trump would grab him by the pussy. \nSpeaking of that Fanta headed prick, I<U+2019>m not in his weight class <U+2018>cus I<U+2019>m not obese, but I<U+2019>ll knock him out all the same. I<U+2019>ll be worth more than him by the end of 205 too. Where<U+2019>s my Hollywood star, fuck it, I<U+2019>ll take the whole Walk. \nBut, back to the tour <U+2013> it would be interesting to note, the actors in Sex in the City are not as rich as me. Chumps. \nWhen you tour around New York, be warned, people will ask you for endless selfies if you are famous as I am. I love the fans, but obviously when in camp, you<U+2019>ve got to watch what you<U+2019>re eating, it can make you a little tetchy, so while reducing my food intake ahead of the weigh in, I like to reduce my selfie intake too. Running from overweight Americans barely counts for cardio, but you<U+2019>ve gotta take every chance to gain the edge over your opponent. \nI was told to try the New York pizza, but can<U+2019>t do that until after my victory, in the mean time I might use it to throw around at the pre-fight press conference. A scalding hot slice slapping Eddie in the face might improve his chances with the ladies. \nPeace out.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Thomas Sowell \n source: thenewamerican.com \n text: Email \nIt is especially painful for me, as an economist, to see that two small cities in northern California <U+2014> San Mateo and Burlingame <U+2014> have rent control proposals on the ballot this election year. \nThere are various other campaigns, in other places around the country, for and against minimum wage laws, which likewise make me wonder if the economics profession has failed to educate the public in the most elementary economic lessons. \nNeither rent control nor minimum wage laws <U+2014> nor price control laws in general <U+2014> are new. Price control laws go back as far as ancient Egypt and Babylon, and they have been imposed at one time or other on every inhabited continent. \nHistory alone should be able to tell us what the actual consequences of such laws have been, since they have been around for thousands of years. Anyone who has taken a course in Economics 1 should understand why those consequences have been so different from what their advocates expected. It is not rocket science. \nNevertheless, advocates of a rent control law are saying things like \"this will prevent some landlords from gouging tenants and making a ton of money off the housing crisis.\" \nThe reason there is a housing crisis in the first place is that existing laws in much of California prevent enough housing from being built to supply the apartments and homes that people want. If landlords were all sweethearts, and never raised rents, that would still not get one new building built. \nRising rents are a symptom of the problem. The actual cause of the problem is a refusal of many California officials to allow enough housing to be built for all the people who want to rent an apartment. \nSupply and demand is one of the first things taught in introductory economics textbooks. Why it should be a mystery to people living in an upscale community <U+2014> people who have probably graduated from an expensive college <U+2014> is the real puzzle. Supply and demand is not a breakthrough on the frontiers of knowledge. \nA century ago, virtually any economist could have explained why preventing housing from being built would lead to higher rents, and why rent control would further widen the gap between the amount of housing supplied and the amount demanded. Not to mention such other consequences as a faster deterioration of existing housing, since upkeep gets neglected when there is a housing shortage. \nToday's economists have advanced to far more complicated problems. It is as if we had the world's greatest mathematicians but most college graduates couldn't do arithmetic. \nPart of the problem is that even our most prestigious colleges seldom have any real curriculum requirements that would ensure that their graduates had at least a basic understanding of economics, history, mathematics, science or other fundamental subjects. \nMany students and their parents spend great amounts of money, and go into debt, for an education that too often leaves them illiterate in economics and ignorant of many other subjects. \nPart of the problem is that many college graduates do not take a single course in economics. Another part of the problem is that many economics departments leave the teaching of introductory economics in the hands of some junior or transient faculty member, or even graduate students who get stuck with the job. \nOne of the things that made me proud of the economics department at UCLA when I taught there, decades ago, was that teaching the introductory economics course was the job of a full professor, even if not the same professor every year. \nIn all too many subjects today, the introductory course is taught by junior faculty, transient faculty or graduate students, while the full professors teach only upper level courses or postgraduate courses. \nThat may save a department the expense of staffing the introductory course with their more highly paid members. But, it is extravagantly expensive from the standpoint of society as a whole, when it means sending graduates out into the world unable to see through the wasteful economic hokum spread by politicians. \nThat is how you get ill-informed voters who support price controls of many kinds, without understanding that prices convey economic realities that do not change just because the government changes the prices. It is as if someone's fever was treated by putting the thermometer in cold water to bring the temperature reading down. You don't get more housing with rent control. \n\nThomas Sowell is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305. His website is www.tsowell.com.

The U.N. and rights groups like Amnesty International have reproached Australia over conditions in Pacific camps, including alleged instances of sexual abuse. Successive Australian governments have defended the policies as necessary to deter criminal trafficking of vulnerable refugees. Germany<U+2019>s Interior Ministry recently said such tougher Australia-style policies was potentially a partial solution for European countries grappling with more than 1 million people who have fled conflicts in Syrian and Africa. Right-wing European politicians in other countries have praised Australia<U+2019>s system. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull <U+2019>s conservatives hope an agreement announced last week will allow it to send as many as 1,200 refugees to the U.S. and shut two Pacific detention centers. Australia in September agreed to take refugees from U.S.-backed camps in Costa Rica. Australian officials have expressed uncertainty whether the agreement can be completed before the Obama administration leaves office in January. And rights groups worry such a deal wouldn<U+2019>t be honored by President-elect Donald Trump, who has voiced a harder stance on immigration , especially Muslims. Most of the Australian-held asylum seekers come from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran and Sri Lanka. <U+201C>We are proceeding on the basis that the U.S. government honors its obligation,<U+201D> said Michael Pezzullo, the head of the country<U+2019>s Immigration Department, in testimony to lawmakers last week. But Mr. Crepeau said he was hopeful the deal reached with the U.S. would survive Mr. Trump<U+2019>s presidency. He said U.S. resettlement would begin <U+201C>probably before Mr Trump<U+2019>s Jan. 20 inauguration and continue after. Mr. Crepeau said Europe<U+2019>s crisis had led to a more cooperative international approach to migrant movement, evidenced by the Obama administration<U+2019>s hosting of a refugee summit in September. The rights envoy also commended Australia<U+2019>s recent agreement to take in 12,000 refugees from Syria beyond the nearly 14,000 it took in under a humanitarian program the past year. But he said Australia<U+2019>s human rights record had been damaged by its migration policies. <U+201D>Australia would vehemently protest if its citizens were treated like this by other counties and especially if Australian children were treated like this,<U+201D> Mr. Crepeau said.

Band described his work as running \"Bill Clinton Inc.\"\n\"We also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the president and his family <U+0096> for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like,<U+0094> Band allegedly said in the document.\nA Teneo representative told ABC News in a statement: \"As the memo demonstrates, Teneo worked to encourage clients, where appropriate, to support the Clinton Foundation because of the good work that it does around the world. It also clearly shows that Teneo never received any financial benefit or benefit of any kind from doing so.\"\nBand, the Clinton Foundation and staff for Bill Clinton did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe memo appeared to be targeted at informing lawyers and top Clinton advisers about fundraising efforts. In previously released emails, dated just days before this memo, Band expressed concern over the conflated, tangled and confused web of personnel roles and money in the Clinton world, citing, for example, his opinion that Chelsea Clinton was running a business out of the family foundation office. In this memo, he pushed for more clearly defined roles and documents outlining conflicts of interest.\nAround this same time, in late 2011 and early 2012, Chelsea Clinton, according to the emails, was complaining and threatening to launch internal investigations after hearing that Teneo employees were making solicitations and evoking her father<U+0092>s name without his approval. This offended Band, and in one email exchange, he purportedly called her a <U+0093>spoiled brat kid.<U+0094>\n\"I don't deserve this from her and deserve a tad more respect or at least a direct dialogue for me to explain these things,<U+0094> Band allegedly wrote in an email to John Podesta , now chairman for Hillary Clinton 's campaign.\nBand added that Chelsea Clinton <U+0093>has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she<U+0092>s doing because she, as she has said, hasn't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life.<U+0094>\nIn the memo, Band said he had convinced Dow Jones and Coca-Cola, two Teneo clients, to give to the Clinton Foundation and pay for in-kind services to Bill Clinton, such as his trips to conferences. It also discussed how Band urged UBS to hire Hillary Clinton to give paid speeches. Moreover, the memo revealed that Laureate International Universities, a for-profit school, was paying Bill Clinton $3.5 million annually to serve as its Honorary Chairman.\nThe Clinton campaign has not confirmed nor denied the authenticity of the emails or commented on any content in them.

As Hillary Clinton and her surrogates fan out across the battleground states, Trump<U+2019>s schedule has found plenty of room for self-promotion that seems aimed well past Nov. 8, including two stops in two days promoting his hotels and the soft launch of what many see as the prototype for a post-campaign Trump TV. Story Continued Below On Monday, Trump<U+2019>s campaign launched a nightly Facebook live news program <U+2014> on the heels of a report that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had spoken with a top industry dealmaker about setting up a Trump network. On Tuesday, Trump summoned the press corps to one of his Florida properties and lavished praise on it. <U+201C>One of the great places on earth,<U+201D> he crowed. On Wednesday, he returns <U+2014> for the fourth time this presidential cycle <U+2014> to his new Washington, D.C., hotel for what his campaign has billed as a <U+201C>ribbon-cutting<U+201D> to celebrate its grand opening. <U+201C>Politics is a side hobby for Trump, kind of like fishing or model railroading. Hotels, that<U+2019>s serious business, and I hear the hotel is fabulous,<U+201D> said Curt Anderson, a top Republican strategist. <U+201C>Which of his aides would like to take credit for scheduling this trip to D.C.? Is no one able to stand up to this guy? No one at all?<U+201D> Never before has a businessman-turned-politician gotten so close to the White House by leveraging his private success and apparent management prowess into a compelling outsider's case to run the country. And never before has a presidential campaign looked so much like an infomercial. The Battleground Project By Marc Caputo From the start, Trump has promoted and patronized his own properties, from riding down the gilded escalators in Trump Tower as he announced his campaign in June 2015 to hosting primary-night news conferences at lavish Mar-a-Lago and reimbursing himself with campaign cash spent to fly on his own 757 jet and rent premium campaign office space inside his flagship building. And while Trump won<U+2019>t meet his infamous 2000 prediction <U+2014> <U+201C>I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it<U+201D> <U+2014> he does seem determined to ensure that the national spotlight that remains fixated on him helps brighten the Trump Organization<U+2019>s bottom line. Hope Hicks, a Trump spokeswoman, defended the decision to divert to liberal Washington, D.C., for a ribbon-cutting with only 13 days left before Election Day. <U+201C>Mr. Trump is attending the opening of his latest project, what many say is the finest hotel in the country,<U+201D> she said in an email. <U+201C>He is extremely proud of the development, which was finished under budget and ahead of schedule. He will be there to commemorate the completion of this important project and support his children, who worked so hard along side of him to accomplish this.<U+201D> Trump<U+2019>s stops in D.C. to draw press to the hotel date back to March, when the property was still under construction. <U+201C>In about a week it gets covered with marble, beautiful marble from different parts of the world,<U+201D> Trump said then. That was only the start of the hype. <U+201C>One of the great buildings of Washington, one of the great buildings in the country,<U+201D> he went on. <U+201C>One of the biggest ballrooms in Washington and by far the most luxurious,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>One of the great hotels of the world,<U+201D> he predicted. When he was done, he lamented that <U+201C>nobody asked about the hotel.<U+201D> And so he led a crush of cameras and reporters on a tour. Trump returned in early September for a tour, handing out exclusive footage and photos to Breitbart, the publication formerly run by his campaign CEO, Stephen Bannon. And he came back the next week for his much-hyped news conference to address his years-long false charge that President Barack Obama is not an American citizen. Trump took no questions. He did speak at length about his hotel after television networks showed live footage of the ballroom for a full hour while waiting for the GOP nominee to appear. CNN<U+2019>s Jake Tapper said the bait-and-switch amounted to a <U+201C>political rick-roll.<U+201D> By Louis Nelson and Eli Stokols When Trump toured the property again during that event <U+2014> and his campaign physically blocked a television producer from joining the TV cameras <U+2014> the TV networks<U+2019> pool decided to delete their footage in protest. That Trump is returning to D.C. <U+2014> a jurisdiction that he has virtually zero chance of capturing next month <U+2014> has Republicans sighing about his motives. <U+201C>Unconventional<U+201D> has become their euphemistic byword. <U+201C>The only rationale I think he<U+2019>d have for that is he sees the handwriting on the wall and he wants to do his best to also protect his brand,<U+201D> said a frustrated senior Republican strategist, who did not want to criticize the nominee publicly. Because federal campaign-finance law requires that the campaign pay to use Trump<U+2019>s properties, every room rental, hotel room and event held there helps his business. While Trump has contributed roughly $56 million to his campaign, the use of his properties <U+2014> and personal jet <U+2014> has offset the cost of those contributions. Through the end of September, Trump<U+2019>s campaign has paid, for instance, more than $200,000 in facility fees and other expenditures to his various golf properties, including about $53,000 to the Trump National Doral Miami, where he campaigned on Tuesday. Trump<U+2019>s traveling press corps was kept in the dark about the nature of Tuesday<U+2019>s event, as they were bused through the beige stucco gates, ushered through the gilded lobby and down to a hallway with a view of the patio where a stage had been erected. Only then did campaign staffers explain what the vaguely described \"campaign event\" would be: a photo op featuring Trump and several of his employees, who were in a line outside being wanded by Secret Service agents. 2016 By Edward-Isaac Dovere Shortly after the media were escorted outside, Trump emerged in his usual navy suit and red tie, applauded by his employees as he strode slowly across the red bricks and onto the stage where he joined them in clapping. With a live network camera pointed at the microphone, Doral general manager David Feder, spoke <U+2014> not about Trump but his resort, which he noted has been awarded with numerous distinctions, including Successful Meetings Magazine's \"Best renovations, 2016\" honor. Trump, stepping to the microphone moments later, followed suit. \"We're very proud of this,\" he began. \"It's 800 acres in the middle of Miami. It's been a tremendous success. We could have renovated the inexpensive way with paint; but instead we ripped it down to the steel, rebuilt Doral.\" \"We've had tremendous success,\" Trump continued. <U+201C>The bookings are through the roof. And I must tell you, the land is great <U+2014> the Blue Monster is one of the great golf courses in the world, the new Blue Monster.<U+201D> Trump<U+2019>s latest exploits have received fawning coverage on his Facebook channel. Bannon, the campaign CEO who stepped down as chairman of Breitbart News to join the campaign, reacted to the suggestion last week that Trump might launch a news network simply by saying, <U+201C>Trump is an entrepreneur<U+201D> <U+2014> twice. Trump isn<U+2019>t the only one giving signals of looking past the election. His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, has tried in recent days to artfully create some distance between herself and the controversial candidate. During the last debate, Conway retweeted a reporter's observation that Trump's offhand remark about \"bad hombres\" was \"Trump being Trump\" while his other, sharper answers were \"Conway-esque.\" She also sat for an extended segment at her home with CNN<U+2019>s Dana Bash, and brushed aside questions about whether she agrees with her candidate<U+2019>s threats to sue the women who have accused him of assault <U+2014> \"It's his campaign, and it's his candidacy,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>It's not for me,<U+201D> Conway said, <U+201C>to take away a grown man's Twitter account.<U+201D> By Bill Scher By Joshua Zeitz By Thomas Wright By Jack Shafer",

How long will you have to wait to get some clues on who is winning? For years, mainstream media outlets have agreed to not report exit-polling data until after the polls have closed<U+2014>on the theory that revealing potential results could affect the outcome. But as Politico reports, that may change this election, as a handful of media projects release exit-polling information throughout the day. Slate and Vice News have joined with real-time projection firm Votecastr, which plans to begin posting projections this morning. Sasha Issenberg, a journalist and the chief strategist at Votecastr, rejected the media orthodoxy that said the information could alter the results. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s not as though voters go to the polls without indications about the state of the horse race,<U+201D> he told Politico. Meanwhile, television networks are gearing up for a huge night amid the intense backlash faced by media outlets this cycle, the New York Times reports. As <U+201C>decision desks<U+201D> get ready, network executives say the pressure is on to make sure there are no mistakes, particularly given Donald Trump<U+2019>s consistent warnings about a <U+201C>rigged<U+201D> election. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s no question that there<U+2019>s added scrutiny this year of the entire system,<U+201D> Steve Capus, executive editor of CBS News, told the Times. FINAL PITCH : Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump used the campaign<U+2019>s last day to pitch voters with final two-minute ads showcasing their closing arguments. As Adweek reports, both campaigns aired their spots on CBS and NBC last night , and the spots racked up views online, too, of course. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s ad, called <U+201C>Tomorrow,<U+201D> is a single shot of the candidate speaking directly to the camera. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s spot (which was released Friday) had a $4 million advertising buy behind it in states such as Florida and Ohio, the campaign said. Other last-minute advertising gambits included a Snapchat lens from a super PAC supporting Mrs. Clinton that placed the candidate<U+2019>s hair on Snapchat users, Ad Age reports. Adweek also notes how a conservative super PAC created <U+201C>Real Talk with Ruth,<U+201D> a video ad series meant to look similar to videos from YouTube influencers. SECOND BITE OF THE APPLE NEWS : Apple has had a shaky run when it comes to its advertising business, with the company pulling back from its iAd unit earlier this year . Now the tech giant is handing over advertising sales duties for Apple News to NBCUniversal, CMO Today reports. Starting in 2017, NBCU will be able to sell ad units that appear between stories or ads within search results in Apple News, though individual publishers that would rather control their own ad inventory can elect to do so and keep 100% of the revenue. NBCU and Apple will share a 30% cut of ad revenue NBCU sells for other publishers, though the exact split between them is unclear. When it launched in 2015, Apple News got off to a rocky start with publishers, particularly because the service initially mistakenly counted readership. Since then, Apple has sought to make some publisher-friendly changes, like allowing publishers to sell subscriptions through the app. As Nieman Lab reports, some publishers say their traffic has improved recently in Apple News. THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE : Twitter<U+2019>s announcement that it plans to shutter six-second looping video platform Vine sparked an outpouring of internet grief . It turned out that, despite the fact that many Vine stars had ditched the app for other platforms and marketers had pretty much forgotten it existed, the service was still widely beloved. Well, now TechCrunch reports that Vine might survive after all . In the wake of the announcement, Twitter has received several bids from potential buyers, including some from Asia, and is in the process of deciding who should run the app, according to TechCrunch. It won<U+2019>t exactly be a big payday: Some bids have come in for under $10 million, according to the report. The New York Times reported that the app was costing about that much a month for <U+201C>infrastructure and employees<U+201D> before the decision to close it. While a deal isn<U+2019>t certain, if Twitter can find a buyer that it thinks will be a successful steward, maybe Vine can have a second life after all.

Trump was in good company on Saturday when his image went up in flames not far from those of the British prime minister, Theresa May, and of a 17th-century pope. In the streets, firecrackers exploded, blazing crosses were carried and the air filled with smoke as the people of Lewes, in southeast England, paraded in a dazzling array of costumes on Nov. 5, the anniversary of a failed plot to blow up Parliament in London in 1605. More than four centuries later, many throughout Britain still commemorate the event <U+2014> known as Bonfire Night, or Guy Fawkes Night (after one of the plotters) <U+2014> though its distinctiveness is being usurped as it sometimes merges with Halloween, a relatively recent import here, or the Hindu festival of Diwali. But not in Lewes. <U+201C>It is the only thing in the whole year which marks us out from everyone else,<U+201D> said Graham Mayhew, the mayor and a historian. <U+201C>People are very proud of it and determined to protect it,<U+201D> he said, adding that residents <U+201C>love the fact that nobody else does this.<U+201D> On a field on the outskirts of the town, giant bonfires burned and fireworks exploded from the head of one of at least two effigies of Mr. Trump <U+2014> this one suspended below a model of a wall adorned with Mexican flags. The spectacles are organized by the town<U+2019>s seven bonfire societies, some of them more than 160 years old. Mr. Mayhew, interviewed before the event, said the subjects should not take their immolation personally. <U+201C>You are not to take it seriously. It<U+2019>s a statement of people<U+2019>s reaction to the news,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>It is not meant as an incitement. It<U+2019>s like a political cartoon <U+2014> it is exposing certain things to ridicule.<U+201D> Lewes (pronounced LEW-is) has several claims to historical fame, being at one time the home of Thomas Paine, the radical American author of <U+201C>Common Sense,<U+201D> who is memorialized with a plaque on the town<U+2019>s White Hart Hotel marking the place where he <U+201C>expounded his revolutionary politics.<U+201D> But it is best known now as the unofficial center of Britain<U+2019>s Bonfire Night tradition, commemorating a moment of deliverance for Protestant England: the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, a plan by Roman Catholics to blow up Westminster Palace and everyone in it, including King James I. Guido, or Guy, Fawkes and his fellow conspirators were captured and suffered gruesome executions. Four centuries later, Lewes celebrates the event in a night carnival with strange, sometimes sectarian, undertones. Through the streets pass those dressed as smugglers, Zulu warriors, Native Americans, Vikings and regimental English soldiers, carrying flags with symbols such as the skull and crossbones. Then there is the effigy of Pope Paul V (the pontiff in 1605) alongside banners reading <U+201C>no popery<U+201D> and flaming crosses. Lewes also commemorates the killing of 17 Protestant martyrs who met their horrific deaths in the town well before the Gunpowder Plot. They were victims of the so-called Marian Persecutions of the 16th century, which took place when Queen Mary (or <U+201C>Bloody Mary<U+201D>) sought to stamp out Protestantism. There is also an act of remembrance for those who died in the major wars of the 20th century. Mr. Mayhew conceded that there was <U+201C>a bit of a hangover from the strong religious feeling of the 19th century,<U+201D> when anti-Catholicism was rife, though he added that <U+201C>most people would be horrified by the idea that they would have religious prejudice.<U+201D> Local Roman Catholics <U+201C>tolerate it,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Sometimes feathers get ruffled. Some of the local priests have taken it more to heart. But everybody recognizes it is part of tradition.<U+201D> <U+201C>It<U+2019>s not right wing. It<U+2019>s not left wing. It is a great celebration of Lewes-ness,<U+201D> he added. The town has a long history of Nonconformism, a form of Protestantism that dissents from the established Church of England, but modern-day Lewes seems more attached to the trappings of sectarianism than its reality. In the book <U+201C>Burn Holy Fire,<U+201D> Jeremy Goring recounts an episode in 1981 when Ian Paisley, a hard-line Protestant lawmaker from Northern Ireland, came to Lewes on Bonfire Night <U+201C>and tried to fan the flames of conflict by distributing anti-Catholic leaflets.<U+201D> <U+201C>His intervention backfired badly, for the following year he himself was burned in effigy,<U+201D> Mr. Goring wrote. The giant crosses ignited to remember the Lewes martyrs appear to be a 19th-century innovation. According to Jim Etherington, a local historian and the author of <U+201C>Lewes Bonfire Night,<U+201D> their prominence increased in recent decades mainly because the police objected on safety grounds to fireworks in the parade, but seemed more relaxed about fiery crosses. The first recorded reference to November celebrations in Lewes dates from 1697, and over the next century and a half the <U+201C>Bonfire boys<U+201D> became increasingly unruly. In 1806, 18 were arrested, and there was a Bonfire Night riot in 1829. By the mid-1800s, there was pressure for more orderly celebrations, leading to the creation of the first bonfire societies, which developed in idiosyncratic ways. Members of the Commercial Square Bonfire Society, for example, adopted American Indian costumes because a handful had spent time in America building railroads in the West. <U+201C>During their time there, they observed the dreadful treatment of the Native American population,<U+201D> the Lewes Bonfire Council website says . Though not exactly secretive, the bonfire societies are not very communicative, either, and the choice of effigies is known only by a handful of people before the unveiling in November. Brian Pugh, another local author, ties the strength of the Bonfire Night tradition to an innate rebelliousness. It is captured by a local saying, <U+201C>We don<U+2019>t be druv,<U+201D> which translates as <U+201C>We won<U+2019>t be pushed around and are a bit rebellious,<U+201D> he said. Perhaps a bigger puzzle is the fact that the Gunpowder Plot <U+2014> and the accompanying rhyme <U+201C>Remember, remember the fifth of November<U+201D> <U+2014> is still commemorated in Britain more than four centuries after it failed. What is so strange about that, wrote James Shapiro in <U+201C>1606: William Shakespeare and the Year of Lear,<U+201D> is that <U+201C>the fifth of November recalls a collective experience, a day of communal deliverance on which nothing actually happened.<U+201D> He added: <U+201C>Nobody has fully explained the deep hold that <U+2018>Remember, remember the fifth of November<U+2019> continues to have on the British psyche (though its grip seems to be slackening and the image of Guy Fawkes may soon be associated more with the visages on the masks worn by Anonymous protesters).<U+201D> It will, however, be some time before Lewes forgets, even if a lot of people here may be hazy about some of the things they are remembering, and perhaps have simpler motives. <U+201C>What other opportunities do you have,<U+201D> asked Mr. Etherington, <U+201C>to dress up in weird and wonderful costumes, when the town has been cleared of traffic?<U+201D> A version of this article appears in print on November 7, 2016, on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Where Burning Figures in Effigy Is Part of the Fun.

No one has been as helpful to Maliki as the Kurdish nation, Kurdistan<U+2019>s political parties, especially the KDP,<U+201D> the party said in a statement. \nThe KDP, whose leader is Masoud Barzani, compared Maliki to one of Saddam Hussein<U+2019>s most notorious henchmen. <U+201C>The disloyalty he has shown and the crimes he has committed against the Kurdish nation are no lesser than the crimes of Ali Hasan al-Majid (chemical Ali). He was the indulged son of the US at some point, yet disloyal to them now,<U+201D> the KDP statement added, referring to Maliki<U+2019>s cooperation with US forces in the past. \nIn an interview with Euronews aired Wednesday, Maliki lashed out at Barzani, accusing him of implementing Israel<U+2019>s policy in the region, claiming, <U+201C>Kurdistan will become the second Palestine in the future,<U+201D> and adding that <U+201C>Israeli sympathizers and elements are abundant in Kurdistan.<U+201D> \nMaliki, who is the secretary general of the Daawa Party and head of the State of Law Faction in parliament, slammed Barzani, saying the, <U+201C>Kurdistan Region has become a strategic and developed platform for the implementation of the US-Israeli policy, and by Kurdistan I do not mean all the Kurds. I mean only Masoud Barzani and the Kurdistan Democratic Party .<U+201D> \nHe also blamed the Kurdistan Region for the presence of Turkish troops in the country. <U+201C>The Turkish Army has come to Bashiqa by permission of the Kurdistan Region.

He is not happy to see the unprecedented coordination between the Peshmerga and the Iraqi Army which are fighting terrorism together, liberating the areas which his coward army gave to ISIS.

Let<U+2019>s hope that it doesn<U+2019>t happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. \nAt this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned <U+201C>about the possibility of violence<U+201D> on election day<U+2026> \nA 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are <U+201C>very concerned.<U+201D> Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are <U+201C>very confident<U+201D> about that. \nMore than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won<U+2019>t recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn<U+2019>t have won fair and square. \nBut many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump<U+2019>s star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax<U+2026> \nDonald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump<U+2019>s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. \nAnd there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump<U+2019>s star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June <U+2026> \nThis is of course not the first time the GOP candidate<U+2019>s star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump<U+2019>s star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump<U+2019>s star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. \nWe have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted <U+201C>Nazi Republicans get out of town or else<U+201D> along with a swastika. \nThere have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece<U+2026> \nOn Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, <U+201C>Why can<U+2019>t they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?<U+201D> \nAround Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. <U+201C>The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by <U+2018>some thugs<U+2019> that a barmaid called out from the back.<U+201D> Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a <U+201C>Blue Lives Matter<U+201D> shirt. \nOn Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a <U+201C>Make America Great Again<U+201D> baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. \nThere is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let<U+2019>s certainly hope that we don<U+2019>t see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. \nOf course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. \nFor example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is <U+201C>grabbing my musket<U+201D> if Donald Trump loses the election<U+2026> \nFormer Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. \nWalsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, <U+201C>On November 8th, I<U+2019>m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I<U+2019>m grabbing my musket. You in?<U+201D> \nAnd without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today <U+2026> \n<U+201C>Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I<U+2019>ve been buying a lot more ammunition,<U+201D> says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan<U+2019>s Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to <U+201C>declare martial law and take our guns away<U+201D> after the election. \nToday America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. \nIronically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . \nIf Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. \nAnd the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month <U+2026> \nAs I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. \nBut at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . \nOut of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. \nPerhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it.",

By Edward-Isaac Dovere 11/20/16 08:20 PM EST President Barack Obama on Sunday started mapping out his vision of Democrats<U+2019> path back <U+2014> and all but pledged to be part of it himself. In his fourth news conference in a week of sounding out to Americans and world leaders what he thinks they should think about President-elect Donald Trump, Obama urged congressional Democrats not to follow Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell<U+2019>s (R-Ky.) model of lockstep resistance against him eight years ago, but to quickly activate all over the country and avoid <U+201C>micro-targeting.<U+201D> Story Continued Below This came as Obama expressed a version of confidence about Trump that on Sunday had him saying, <U+201C>reality will force him to adjust how he approaches many of these issues,<U+201D> even as he revealed that he<U+2019>d told the president-elect in their post-election Oval Office meeting to hire <U+201C>a strong White House counsel<U+201D> to help prevent the conflict-of-interest and corruption issues that many see potentially starting to take shape as Trump and his children continue to mix business dealings and transition policy decisions. And though Obama said he wouldn<U+2019>t get involved in every fight <U+2014> including some fights likely to be about Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress ripping out his legacy <U+2014> he very deliberately refused to say he<U+2019>d hold to the tradition of presidents avoiding public comment or political attacks on their successors. Congress By Rachael Bade and John Bresnahan <U+201C>I want to be respectful of the office and give the president-elect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance,<U+201D> Obama said, but <U+201C>as an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it<U+2019>s necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I<U+2019>ll examine it when it comes.<U+201D> Obama was speaking at a news conference in Peru just before flying back from a weeklong foreign trip that he said was <U+201C>likely<U+201D> his last as president (a potential shift, as he and aides had until Sunday been definitive in calling this his last foreign trip), at the end of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit where he<U+2019>d met with, among others, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese President Shinzo Abe, who have all had different interests in the election results. Obama<U+2019>s refusal to sit back will be welcome news to many Democrats who are searching for party leadership and who are still largely in love with him. But his advice about not waging all-out war on Trump and the Republicans isn<U+2019>t what many in the shell-shocked party want to hear. Obama said of the new administration and Congress, <U+201C>give them a hearing.<U+201D> Earlier in the news conference, Obama said <U+201C>people should take a wait-and-see approach<U+201D> on Trump. Many Democrats feel like they<U+2019>ve heard and seen enough already. But Obama, as he often does, urged a long view over immediate political satisfaction. <U+201C>My advice to Democrats is, know what you care about and what you stand for and fight for your principles, even if it<U+2019>s a hard fight. If there are areas where the new administration is doing something that<U+2019>s good for the American people, find a way to work with them,<U+201D> he said. The situation is dire, and potentially generational: Democrats head into 2018 facing not just the usual expected midterm turnout problems but also a Senate map that has them so much on defense that they struggled to find someone to chair the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. That, though, is only part of their problems: Starting from deep in the hole across the country, they<U+2019>ll need to win governors' races and state legislature seats in order to stop Republicans from gerrymandering them further into the permanent minority in the next round of redistricting following the 2020 Census. And then there<U+2019>s the fact that four years out from the next presidential election, there isn<U+2019>t a single clear candidate to take on Trump <U+2014> a fact that Obama has dismissed in recent days as mirroring where the party stood after the 2004 elections, but doesn<U+2019>t account for the fact that already by the time John Kerry conceded, Obama, Hillary Clinton and John Edwards were already among the national figures expected to run. But don<U+2019>t despair, Obama said, pointing out that Clinton won the popular vote this year and that Democrats continue to get more cumulative votes in congressional elections, though the structure of the system means that<U+2019>s not necessarily helpful for the Electoral College or congressional representation. On top of that, Obama noted, his own approval rating remains high, and a Gallup poll just out shows higher approval numbers for the Democratic Party than the GOP. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m not worried about being the last Democratic president <U+2014> not even for a while,<U+201D> Obama said, batting back one reporter<U+2019>s question. Presidential Transition By Matthew Nussbaum All year long, as he pushed hard for Clinton, Obama privately expressed anxiety that though he assumed she<U+2019>d win, she<U+2019>d come in without any wind at her back for getting anything done. In the past week, he<U+2019>s made several public comments implicitly knocking her campaign strategy as too narrowly focused on base turnout, letting Trump run up the score elsewhere in ways that she wasn<U+2019>t able to overcome. The dynamics of Clinton<U+2019>s narrow losses in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania <U+2014> if she<U+2019>d won all three, she<U+2019>d be the president-elect <U+2014> can be seen as telling that story. Rather than over-read the election results and call for a <U+201C>complete overhaul,<U+201D> Obama said, he urged his party to get smarter. This comes, though, after eight years of many Democratic leaders complaining that Obama never seemed committed to or interested in electing down-ballot Democrats, and as his White House systematically atrophied the Democratic National Committee party apparatus. Obama<U+2019>s own Organizing for Action group, grown out of his presidential campaign structure, has not emerged into anything like the force expected. <U+201C>Doing better involves us working at the grass roots, not ceding territory, going out into areas where right now we may not stand a chance of actually winning, we<U+2019>re building up a cadre of young talent, we<U+2019>re making arguments, we<U+2019>re persuading, we<U+2019>re talking about the things that matter to ordinary people day-to-day and trying to avoid some of the constant distractions that fill up people<U+2019>s Twitter accounts,<U+201D> Obama said. <U+201C>If we do that, then I<U+2019>m confident that we<U+2019>ll be back on track.<U+201D> By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Danny Haiphong \n source: blackagendareport.com \n text: 2016 presidential campaign by Danny Haiphong \nThe crisis that has enveloped U.S. imperialism, under both Republican and Democratic rule, rocked the corporate duopoly system and opened the door for Donald Trump's ascension to power. Decades ago, <U+201C>the Republicans became the White Man<U+2019>s Party while the Democrats neutralized the left.<U+201D> Trump is the result. <U+201C>A genuine, radical left with any vision at all would not tremble before a Donald Trump Administration or mourn a Clinton loss.<U+201D> System Breakdown: Trump's Chickens Come Home to Roost by Danny Haiphong \n<U+201C>The left can no longer afford to suppress the material struggle for liberation in place of a rhetorical struggle against racism.<U+201D> \nA number of people dropped their jaw in fear after Trump's victory in the 2016 elections. My jaw dropped for a different reason. Trump's victory occurred without the support of the ruling class. Most of his supporters came from the disaffected white working class and petit bourgeoisie (think \"small\" business). The Trump victory is thus a monumental moment in US history. The two-party corporate duopoly could not have drawn a worse hand and the ruling class has settled with Trump out of sheer limitation. US imperialism is in a state of system breakdown. The chickens have come home to roost. \nSo how did Trump win? For one, Trump's legions were the only section of the voting age population energized to vote. As BAR's Bruce Dixon has noted , voter suppression has been a common practice in most states for decades. This combined with nearly four decades of capitalist crisis has placed the US political system in a dead-end situation. The Democratic Party has become the truest expression of the ruling capitalist class over this period. It instituted the trade deals, wars, austerity policies, and expanded the police and prison forces necessary to maintain the rule of capitalism in decline. The material conditions of the crisis these policies set into motion ultimately opened the door for Trump's chickens to come home to roost. \n<U+201C>US imperialism is in a state of system breakdown.<U+201D> \nTrump's base is on the move namely to resurrect more favorable economic conditions, historically distributed on a racial basis, of a prior stage of capitalism. War on behalf of industrial capital once distributed income and wealth more favorably to a larger portion of whites. Capitalist decline has forever changed these conditions. The Democratic Party and Republican Party are both responsible for the current conditions of depravity, racism, and neo-liberal psychosis that currently plagues US society. Starting in the 1970s, the Republicans became the White Man<U+2019>s Party while the Democrats neutralized the left. Four decades of two-party misery greatly influenced the outcome of the 2016 elections. \nWhat is striking about Trump's base is how it was able to compel the Electoral College to betray the wishes of the ruling class. During the Democratic primary, delegates were more than happy to abandon popular will in favor of Clinton. But much has changed since the Democratic Party suppressed the Sanders campaign. WikiLeaks exposed the many crimes of Hillary Clinton. Although Clinton won the popular vote, many Black, Latino, union, and women voters decided not to opt for her as President. Those that did held their nose and were thus seen as less of a threat to the ruling class than the possibility of a dejected Trump base. \n<U+201C> The Democratic Party and Republican Party are both responsible for the current conditions of depravity, racism, and neo-liberal psychosis that currently plagues US society.<U+201D> \nThe left in the US must come to terms with reality. It has spent decades trailing behind the crisis of imperialism by throwing its full support to the Democratic Party appendage of the ruling class. So-called white liberals in particular ridiculed the supposedly backward character of white workers and acted as if they possessed an anti-racist bone in their own bodies. The liberal-left as a whole bound themselves to the party of dead-end capitalism in order to avoid the party of the White Man. It was only a matter of time before the two-party corporate duopoly would rupture under the weight of its own contradictions. \nThe Trump Administration is thus a logical conclusion of, and not a resolution to, the contradictions of imperialism. The left must now confront what it has avoided for too long. Never has it been clearer that Trump is the logical conclusion to the misery of life under US imperialism. The Democrats overplayed their hand, thinking that rhetoric alone could maintain its false image as the \"left\" wing of the two-party system. Yet even though the Democrats have consistently betrayed their base on behalf of the ruling class, millions of Clinton supporters are in a state of mourning over her loss. \n<U+201C>The liberal-left as a whole bound themselves to the party of dead-end capitalism in order to avoid the party of the White Man.<U+201D> \nA genuine, radical left with any vision at all would not tremble before the feet of a Donald Trump Administration or mourn a Clinton loss. The left must explore the many facets of the Trump development. It must no longer ignore the white workers and petty bourgeois Trump supporters that have brought real material demands to the fore. The left can no longer afford to suppress the material struggle for liberation in place of a rhetorical struggle against racism. The ruling class is in disarray and the Trump victory proves it. \nA Trump Presidency won't be a simple trip to the apocalypse. Even with a majority in the House and the Senate, the Republican Party must now choose to align itself to Trumpist politics or continue to collaborate with the Democratic Party to destroy him. There is no doubt that Wall Street, the military industrial complex, and the rest of the bourgeoisie will attempt to control the unpredictable white nationalist billionaire. The New York Times has already made overtures about a \"conflict of interest\" between his business investments and his newfound political position. Of course, the Times never had an issue with Obama when he bailed out Wall Street or chose his cabinet from a list provided by Citigroup. \n<U+201C> The left must take advantage of the internal squabbling among the ruling class that is surely to come.<U+201D> \nTrump is no Wall Street politician so he will inevitably face many contradictions while in office. Will he respect his base's wishes to build mutual ties with Russia and rollback NATO? Will he keep his promise to rid of NAFTA and the TPP? Or will he capitulate to the ruling class, angering his base and potentially setting up an early grave for his Administration? And what will the bourgeoisie do should they not be able to control him? All of these questions must be asked. The left must take advantage of the internal squabbling among the ruling class that is surely to come. Conditions remain favorable to organize a truly radical, left political agenda for social transformation. \nThe ruling class will attempt to neutralize the left by controlling Trump<U+2019>s agenda and simultaneously piecing together the Democratic Party for the 2020 elections. It remains to be seen whether this will effectively save the system from collapse. Because the truth is, Trump is not a reflection of some American apocalypse. His victory is a product of system breakdown. Over the next four years, it would serve the left well to defeat any possibility of a Democratic Party resurrection so a true party of the people can arise in this moment of opportunity. Liberals will mourn, but revolutionaries will fight. Danny Haiphong is an Asian activist and political analyst in the Boston area. He can be reached at [email protected]",

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: opednews.com \n text: License DMCA \nHow did the \"growing trust\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin once said marked his \"working and personal relationship with President Obama \" change into today's deep distrust and saber-rattling? \nTheir relationship reached its zenith after Mr. Putin persuaded Syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction, enabling Mr. Obama at the last minute to call off, with some grace, plans to attack Syria in late summer 2013. But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the \"feverish\" state of international relations and lamented: \"My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.\" He complained about \"people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice\" and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a \"common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.\" \nA month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, \"My good friend John Kerry ... is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerry's] assurances that the U.S. commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief.\" Do not chalk this up to paranoia. The U.S.-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire -- not to mention statements at the time by the most senior U.S. generals -- were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia. \nRelations between the U.S. and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft -- including any stealth aircraft -- over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft. - Advertisement - \nIt seems possible that the U.S. air force will challenge that claim in due course -- perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, \"I wouldn't put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft ... if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground.\" \nInjecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russia's warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a U.S. or coalition aircraft. \nMeanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the U.S. is contributing \"a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team\" as a \"major sign of the U.S. commitment to strengthening deterrence here.\" \n\"This was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,\" he explained, referring to NATO's July summit meeting in the Polish capital. \"The United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany.\" \nOn Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the \" myth \" of a \"Russian military threat,\" calling this a \"profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets ... expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders.\" - Advertisement - \nMyth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russia's borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against \"saber-rattling ,\" adding that, \"We are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation.\" \nSpeaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two and a half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup d'e'tat in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russia's reaction in annexing Crimea. \nAmericans malnourished on the diet served up by \"mainstream\" media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the U.S. ambassador in Kiev, during which \"Yats\" (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washington's choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev. \nThis unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, \"really the most blatant coup in history.\"",

While Mr. Ryan didn<U+2019>t rescind his endorsement of Mr. Trump, he drew immediate outrage from the nominee and his supporters, who said the speaker risked undermining the candidate just four weeks from Election Day. It came days after the release of a 2005 video showing the GOP nominee talking about kissing and groping women without their consent. That video release has spurred several elected Republicans to disavow their support of the GOP nominee just as Democrat Hillary Clinton has widened her lead in most polls. That darkening picture for Republicans has some in the party concerned that they won<U+2019>t be able to maintain their majorities in the Senate and even in the House. Monday<U+2019>s war of words shows that the Republican Party is as divided as ever, with members abandoning any pretense of coming together and little prospect that they will soon. Mr. Ryan told House Republicans Monday on a conference call that they should make their own decision about whether to maintain their support for Mr. Trump in light of the 2005 video release, according to people on the call. That triggered a backlash from some rank-and-file lawmakers and also from Mr. Trump himself, who shot back on Twitter : <U+201C>Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee.<U+201D> Mr. Ryan<U+2019>s motivation was evident in the latest polls. Mrs. Clinton, in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, jumped to an 11-point lead over Mr. Trump, 46% to 35%, among likely voters on a ballot including third-party candidates. The survey was taken over the weekend, after the videotape was released. In the survey last month, Mrs. Clinton had a 6 percentage point lead in a four-way contest. More worrisome for the speaker: The poll found that Democrats<U+2019> advantage on the question of which party should control Congress widened to 7 percentage points from 3 percentage points last month. Explaining why he wouldn<U+2019>t be defending Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan himself said he would spend his energy until Election Day making sure that if Mrs. Clinton is elected, she wouldn<U+2019>t be given a <U+201C>blank check<U+201D> with a Democratic-controlled Congress, according to someone on the call. <U+201C>The speaker is going to spend the next month focused entirely on protecting our congressional majorities,<U+201D> said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan. But many rank-and-file Republicans pushed back at GOP leadership. The fight played out on the conference call, outside the Republican National Committee headquarters, where Trump supporters gathered, and on social media. In each venue, the message was the same. <U+201C>I expressed my outrage that a Republican leader was undermining a Republican candidate for president,<U+201D> said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California. <U+201C>What I heard seemed to be setting us up for a loss to Hillary, which isn't necessarily the case at all.<U+201D> Mr. Ryan got <U+201C>raked over the coals<U+201D> for distancing himself from Mr. Trump, according to one lawmaker on the call. Republicans pointed out that Democrats didn<U+2019>t drop support for Mrs. Clinton after her email scandal, and they said that Mr. Ryan and other Republican leaders risked driving Mr. Trump<U+2019>s support down to levels that would cost House Republicans their seats. <U+201C>The difference between Trump getting 47% and 43% is the difference between some of our members returning to Congress and not returning,<U+201D> the lawmaker said. Some analysts said Monday that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s attacks on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during Sunday night<U+2019>s second debate would please his most loyal followers and were likely to slow the defections. <U+201C>There was certainly division and different opinions about what should happen,<U+201D> on the call, said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R., Mich.), who has stuck to his position that he would vote for Mr. Trump but criticize him when he feels necessary. <U+201C>The consensus was, look, anybody who might have some sort of notion that we should somehow switch candidates or that we could<U+2014>that just isn<U+2019>t realistic.<U+201D> Mr. Huizenga said there was a <U+201C>tense and frustrated<U+201D> mood on the call. Another lawmaker said so many people lined up in the queue to respond to Mr. Ryan that the call was ended before everyone could speak. While the reaction on the call appeared likely to halt the weekend exodus of GOP lawmakers, at least among House lawmakers, Republican lawmakers and aides said they were still nervous that more damaging material about Mr. Trump could surface. But Republicans also know their prospects of keeping control of the Senate and House are tightly interlaced with Mr. Trump<U+2019>s fate and that a crushing defeat could cost them their congressional majorities. <U+201C>This isn<U+2019>t rocket science<U+2014>the better Donald Trump does, the better our party does,<U+201D> one Republican lawmaker told Mr. Ryan on the call. Mr. Ryan interjected, saying he wasn<U+2019>t abandoning Mr. Trump but was instead focused on the House, according to a person on the call. Some Republican participants on the call defended Mr. Trump and called for unity, according to a GOP aide. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s combative style in his second debate with Mrs. Clinton appeared to have exceeded the expectations of some viewers, but Mrs. Clinton is expected to expand her lead in battleground states in the fallout over Mr. Trump<U+2019>s crude comments about women. In a CNN / ORC poll of debate watchers released Monday morning, 57% thought Mrs. Clinton won the second debate, compared with 34% for Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump <U+201C>did well enough to end the GOP defections, and that<U+2019>s the major takeaway,<U+201D> Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, said in a note to clients Monday morning. Some of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s most vocal champions in Congress reiterated their support for him after Sunday night<U+2019>s debate. Notably, Mr. Ryan didn't put out a statement praising Mr. Trump<U+2019>s performance, as he did after the first presidential debate. <U+201C>We have a binary choice here: you<U+2019>re going to have one or another as president of the United States,<U+201D> Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) said on CNN Monday morning. <U+201C>They are both flawed candidates.<U+201D> Mrs. Blackburn said she still supported Mr. Trump because she thought he offered better solutions on health-care policy and national security. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, dismissed rumors that he was thinking of pulling out of the campaign, saying they were <U+201C>absolutely false.<U+201D> Mr. Pence denounced Mr. Trump<U+2019>s lewd remarks Saturday, but praised his performance after the debate. Mr. Trump predicted that defections from senior Republicans, including Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, a member of Senate GOP leadership, would backfire, calling them <U+201C>self-righteous hypocrites<U+201D> whose poll numbers would plummet. Late Sunday night, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said on Fox that members of Congress have <U+201C>rubbed up against women,<U+201D> saying <U+201C>these people on their high horses are accusing him of being this awful person.<U+201D> On Monday morning, Ms. Conway said the Trump campaign would welcome back any defectors. <U+201C>We would love their support, but you know what, we have their voters<U+2019> support,<U+201D> she said on MSNBC<U+2019>s Morning Joe. Democrats said Mr. Trump<U+2019>s attacks on Bill Clinton and his pledge to jail Mrs. Clinton demonstrated that he didn't have the temperament to be president. <U+201C>I would say it<U+2019>s chilling that Donald Trump thinks that the presidency is like some banana republic dictatorship where you can lock up your political opponents,<U+201D> Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign manager, said Monday on CBS . <U+2014>Allison Kite contributed to this article.

BAGLI \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-debt.html?_r=0 \n text: Abraham Wallach thought he had scored a major career break when Donald J. Trump hired him in 1990 for a senior executive role. Based on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s boasting and gaudy lifestyle, Mr. Wallach imagined he would soon be leading impressive construction projects around the globe. Instead, he found an array of failing enterprises, he recalled on Monday. Many top executives had departed the Trump Organization, and those who remained were often huddled in closed-door meetings with bankers and whispering worriedly among themselves. <U+201C>Everyone was very glum,<U+201D> Mr. Wallach said. <U+201C>It was like getting on the Titanic just before the women and children were moved to the lifeboats.<U+201D> That year, he would later learn, was the beginning of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s reckoning with a decade of rapid, debt-fueled expansion. The eclectic empire Mr. Trump had built with leverage from his father<U+2019>s brick-and-mortar fortune began to fail, generating enormous losses and bringing him to the brink of personal bankruptcy . The full magnitude of the financial hemorrhaging was a closely held secret until this weekend, when The New York Times published portions of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s 1995 tax records that showed business losses of $916 million, creating a tax deduction that could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years. For a single businessman to declare losses approaching $1 billion is so extraordinary that it caused several accountants and lawyers consulted by The Times to blanch. The precise breakdown of that figure <U+2014> specifically which Trump enterprises were responsible for how much <U+2014> remains murky, hidden in a schedule attached to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s returns that has not become public. But a review of public records and interviews with those who were present makes clear that it was decisions Mr. Trump made at the helm of his business empire during the 1980s that led to its nearly imploding. Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, portrays himself now as a self-made man who began life with what he has characterized as a meager $1 million advance from his father. That figure itself represents a significant understatement about the support his father provided him over the years. But in his darkest moment, Mr. Trump again leaned on his family<U+2019>s wealth, this time to ride out a financial tsunami. At one point, the balance of his personal bank accounts was expected to drop below $1 million. By 1990, Mr. Trump had amassed $3.4 billion in debt, much of it in the form of high-interest junk bonds. He was personally liable for $832.5 million of that. He had bought a yacht for $29 million, the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million and a failing airline for $365 million. All were losing money. Details of the losses are not available, because the entities were privately held. But reviews by New Jersey casino regulators and securities filings related to debt offerings show a grim picture. The Castle casino in Atlantic City recorded total losses of $93.2 million in 1990 and 1991. The Trump Regency hotel there lost $8.3 million in 1991. The Trump Plaza casino lost $29.2 million in 1991. Casino regulators in New Jersey warned that <U+201C>the possibility of a complete financial collapse of the Trump Organization is not out of the question.<U+201D> Most, if not all, of those losses would pass through to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s tax returns because of the ownership structure of the casinos. The Casino Control Commission concluded in 1991 that <U+201C>Mr. Trump cannot be considered financially stable, a condition for renewing his casino licenses at Taj Mahal, Castle and Plaza.<U+201D> Still, it did not pull the plug on him. <U+201C>The consequences of doing that would have been horrific,<U+201D> said Steven P. Perskie, who was chairman of the commission from 1991 to 1994. <U+201C>We weren<U+2019>t prepared to do that unless we had no choice.<U+201D> His airline, Trump Shuttle, lost $34.5 million during just six months in 1990. In addition to actual losses from his other businesses, the nearly $1 billion total in losses probably also includes paper losses on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s real estate holdings through the use of depreciation rules that allow real estate developers to deduct the cost of a building over a number of years. By the end of 1991, the amount of cash that Mr. Trump had personally available to him had fallen below $1.7 million and was expected to fall below $800,000 within months <U+2014> a small cushion given his monthly expenditures. Further squeezed by a recession, Mr. Trump fell $4.1 million behind on the property tax bill for a large swath of land he owned on the West Side of Manhattan. The measures he promised to take repeatedly did not work, casino regulators noted. At several points, he turned to his family fortune. He promised to make up for a cash shortfall with the sale of condominium units in Trump Tower in Manhattan. When that did not generate enough money, he filled the hole in his balance sheet with the <U+201C>unforecasted receipt of funds from certain family-owned properties in New York City<U+201D> <U+2014> apparently referring to fees from properties his father, Fred C. Trump, had built outside Manhattan. At the end of 1990, when Mr. Trump was facing an $18.4 million interest payment, his father sent a lawyer to the Castle casino to buy $3.3 million in chips and leave without cashing them, providing his son with an infusion of cash. By 1993, Mr. Trump was still in dire straits. He dispatched a company executive to ask his siblings if he could borrow $10 million from their respective shares of the family trust. Mr. Trump received the loan, according to people who were involved and spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering him, and went back for another $20 million the following year. Mr. Trump has denied borrowing from his siblings. Mr. Trump had negotiated reduced interest rates on some of his loans, partially by agreeing to give up money-losing enterprises, including his airline, his yacht and a stake in the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. His lenders forced him to live for a time on $450,000 a month. In 1995, Mr. Trump began the transaction that would eventually free him from his financial travails. He took his struggling casinos public, selling stock to raise money and shifting his personal debt into the new company. The company continued to lose money and underperform its competitors, but Mr. Trump was paid roughly $45 million though 2009. Mr. Wallach, who left the Trump Organization in 2001 to deal with a chronic shoplifting and theft problem, said the change in the organization was palpable. Mr. Trump began to regain his footing and focused again on real estate, taking steps to ensure that he was less dependent on his own cash and personally guaranteeing loans. In 1996, the year that the tax records obtained by The Times were filed, Mr. Trump basked in the glow of news reports marking his apparent return from financial abyss. One such comeback article appeared in The Times in April of that year. <U+201C>This just represents the best point in my life,<U+201D> Mr. Trump told a Times reporter as he settled into a stretch limousine. <U+201C>I think it says that what I<U+2019>ve been doing over the years has been right.<U+201D> A version of this article appears in print on October 4, 2016, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Decisions in <U+2019>80s Nearly Led Trump to Ruin.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Eddy Lavine \n source: worldtruth.tv \n text: posted by Eddie While the sky-high potency may scare some away, Crystalline provides a surprisingly clean, focused, and inspired high. There<U+2019>s a new kid on the block; her name is Crystalline, and she<U+2019>s from the Hash Family. Crystalline hash is the latest craze in the hash community, and everyone wants a taste. The demand is so high that THC-A Crystalline is going for $200 a gram in southern California dispensaries . Testing in at an astonishing 99.9% THC, Crystalline is officially the strongest hash on the market. Other concentrates such as ice hash , rosin , and BHO range from 50-80% THC. Macro image of THC Crystalline. Photo courtesy of Allie Beckett. Cannabis concentrates are known for their variety of textures and forms, from shatter to wax to crumble, there<U+2019>s something for everyone to enjoy. What many extract lovers don<U+2019>t realize is that these various textures develop from the solvent used to make the concentrate and the methods of purging the solvent out of the final product. However, when THC is reduced to its purest state, it crystallizes, creating crystal <U+2018>rocks<U+2019> which look very different than any other marijuana concentrate on the market. Crystalline turns many people off just because of its looks. The internet is filled with scornful reviews of its meth-like appearance, and this criticism is entirely valid. But don<U+2019>t judge a book by its cover because cannabis crystalline is the purest form of THC and provides sufficient relief for many patients suffering from debilitating and fatal illnesses. And hey, it<U+2019>s not THC<U+2019>s fault that it<U+2019>s a compound with a crystal structure. Guild Extracts, a Southern California extraction company, is the current leader of crystalline production. Their crystallizing process is kept under lock and key, but they claim the ability to make THC-A Crystalline out of any starting material ranging from hydrocarbon extract, CO2 extract, and ice water concentrate. One thing Guild Extracts has made clear is that they are not using a solvent to create this hash, rather, they are extracting pure THC from their starting materials. You may be wondering, what exactly is THC-A Crystalline? Well, before THC is combusted (lit on fire or vaporized) it sits in its raw acidic form, also known as THC-A. THC-A by itself is completely inactive, meaning if it is ingested it will not get you high (but it does have an extraordinary amount of medicinal benefits). When THC-A is activated through heat in a process called decarboxylation, the acidic carbon atom (the <U+201C>A<U+201D> in THC-A) is removed leaving behind the psychoactive THC that so many of us know and love. Macro image of THC Crystalline produced by Atom Labs. Photo courtesy of Allie Beckett. Now remember, this pure THC does not contain terpenes (the magical compounds that give cannabis strains their distinctive aroma and flavor profiles while contributing to their therapeutic effects). To make up for the lack of flavor, Guild Extracts has become famous for the <U+201C>dip n dab,<U+201D> dipping the crystalline concentrate into terpenes extracted from strains like Goji OG, Tangie, and Sherbert. While the sky-high potency may scare some away, Crystalline provides a surprisingly clean, focused, and inspired high. Plus, health nuts can rest easy knowing that THC-A Crystalline is completely free of any chemical inputs (think butane). source:",

Nobel laureate Bob Dylan sang that the times they were a-changin<U+2019> back in 1964. What has changed is the pace of change: <U+201C>The three largest forces on the planet<U+2014>technology, globalization, and climate change<U+2014>are all accelerating at once,<U+201D> notes New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman in <U+201C>Thank You for Being Late: An Optimist<U+2019>s Guide to Thriving in the Age of Accelerations.<U+201D> Gradual change allows for adaptation; one generation figures out trains, another airplanes. Now, in a world where taxi-cab regulators will figure out Uber just in time for self-driving cars to render such services obsolete, <U+201C>so many aspects of our societies, workplaces, and geopolitics are being reshaped and need to be reimagined.<U+201D> All of it creates a sense of discomfort and provokes backlash<U+2014>witness Brexit and the American presidential election. Yet there is cause for optimism, Mr. Friedman believes. Humans are crafty creatures. In this book, Mr. Friedman tries to press pause. The title comes from the author<U+2019>s exclamation to a tardy breakfast companion: The unexpected downtime had given him an opportunity to reflect. If we all take such time to think, he claims, we can figure out how to <U+201C>dance in a hurricane.<U+201D> It<U+2019>s a comforting idea, though one wonders why, if Mr. Friedman was so happy for this pre-breakfast downtime, he was busily scheduling daily breakfast meetings in the first place. Likewise, this ambitious book, while compelling in places, skips about a lot. His attempt to cover much of the history of modern technology, for instance, quickly descends into gee-whiz moments and ubiquitous exclamation points. Big-belly garbage cans have sensors that wirelessly announce when they need to be emptied, and so Mr. Friedman marvels that <U+201C>yes, even the garbageman is a tech worker now. . . . That garbage can could take an SAT exam!<U+201D> By Thomas L. Friedman (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 486 pages, $28) To cope with disruptive change that can result in jobs being automated or sent abroad, Mr. Friedman repeats the common exhortation to become lifelong learners. He praises AT&T<U+2019>s corporate learning initiatives, in particular, as a new <U+201C>bargain<U+201D> and <U+201C>social contract<U+201D> with employees. Just to be clear, though, AT&T requires that <U+201C>you take the courses on your own time.<U+201D> Mr. Friedman never puts in context that the $8,000 that employees get per year is roughly what AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson earns in an hour. Such paternalistic condescension on the part of America<U+2019>s elites may help explain the populist anger evident in the American election, though (having written this book before the unexpected outcome) Mr. Friedman can be forgiven for not delving into the backlash forces as much as he might have. Yet his section on politics is one of the strangest of the whole tome. Noting that American political parties lack ideological flexibility, he announces that he is adopting flexible, adaptable Mother Nature as a political mentor and goes on to describe his vision of <U+201C>Mother Nature<U+2019>s political party<U+201D> and her very specific endorsements. Mother Nature is now on record as supporting single-payer health care, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a change in the inflation formula used to determine cost-of-living increases in Social Security, and warning labels on sugary drinks. While many of Mr. Friedman<U+2019>s arguments may be sensible, he seems to believe he must claim that a higher power is on his side. The author<U+2019>s strengths finally come to the fore when <U+201C>Thank You for Being Late<U+201D> wends its way toward geopolitics, particularly the Middle East, where Mr. Friedman spent years as a reporter. He divides the planet into <U+201C>the World of Order,<U+201D> where society mostly works, and <U+201C>the World of Disorder,<U+201D> where it doesn<U+2019>t. This shockingly simple insight transcends any foreign-policy ideological labels while offering a useful framework for understanding the importance of a <U+201C>reasonably functioning Russian state<U+201D> and concerns about a bullying but stable China. At least they<U+2019>re not Syria<U+2014>yet. Mr. Friedman ends his inquiry into technology and globalization with by far the best part of the book: an eloquent mini-memoir of growing up in the small town of St. Louis Park, Minn. While modern political institutions now may appear to be falling apart, there (in his memories) civic life worked. The community accepted Jewish families such as his with minimal strife. The public schools excelled, and people didn<U+2019>t flaunt their riches. Social ties were such that when Mr. Friedman<U+2019>s father died suddenly, friends and neighbors stepped in to make sure he suffered no material want. To be sure, 1960s Minnesota was not perfect. <U+201C>Racism was still rife. Sexism was still rampant<U+2014>if many of my teachers were amazingly talented women, it was in part because the full world of work was not yet open to them.<U+201D> But he explains that he made a recent sojourn back to discover whether it is possible to re-create such healthy communities, which can help people weather change. The answer? Maybe. These days, Minnesota is laboring to assimilate Hmong families and Somali refugees and to heal racial wounds evident in the 2016 police shooting, during a traffic stop, of Philando Castile. Mr. Friedman discovers, not surprisingly, that this is tough work. But the happy news is that scores of nice Minnesotans are doing their best to try. Mr. Friedman<U+2019>s accounts of real folks<U+2019> dogged efforts toward building community are more moving than his folksy asides about technology. In a country torn by a divisive election, technological change and globalization, reconstructing social ties so that people feel respected and welcomed is more important than ever. The only way to dance in a hurricane is to stay in the eye, Mr. Friedman writes, and <U+201C>the closest political analogue for the eye of a hurricane that I can think of is a healthy community.<U+201D> Healthy communities create trust, and <U+201C>When people trust each other, they can be much more adaptable and open to all forms of pluralism.<U+201D> Rather than build walls, they face their problems and solve them. In his telling, this is the way to make America great. Ms. Vanderkam<U+2019>s most recent book is <U+201C>I Know How She Does It: How Successful Women Make the Most of Their Time.<U+201D>",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Joe Martino \n source: thesleuthjournal.com \n text: in: Natural Medicine Bitter melon is a fruit that grows abundantly in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. Traditionally it has been used to treat diabetes and other more mild diseases or illnesses. More recently, bitter melon juice was shown to kill pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in mice in a study done by the University of Colorado. Considering the results were seen in both in vitro and in vivo tests, the effectiveness of bitter melon juice in treating pancreatic cancer, and potentially other cancers, at a clinical level are promising.[ 1 ] <U+201C>IHC analyses of MiaPaCa-2 xenografts showed that BMJ (Bitter Melon Juice) also inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis and activates AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) in vivo . Overall, BMJ exerts strong anticancer efficacy against human pancreatic carcinoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo , suggesting its clinical usefulness.<U+201D> Pancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to treat due to the fact that it is often discovered late, leaving very little time to treat. Since traditional therapies (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery etc) were not showing promising results and littler advancement was being made, researchers have been looking elsewhere to find treatment. Interestingly, cannabis, specifically cannabinoids, have been shown to induce apoptic (programmed) death of human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and stop pancreatic tumor growth in vivo.[ 4 ] Cannabis is perhaps one of the most popular treatments being aggressively pursued right now given its promising results both in labs and anecdotally. Many cancerous tumors have insulin receptors which move glucose to cancer cells helping them to grow and divide. Studies have shown that insulin encourages pancreatic cancer cells to grow in a dose dependant manner, since bitter melon has been shown to help regulate insulin levels, this could help prevent pancreatic cancer over the long-term. The Colorado University study was led by Dr. Rajesh Agarwal. They examined effects of bitter melon on 4 different lines of pancreatic cancer cells (in vitro) and in mice. For the in vivo studies, mice were injected with pancreatic tumor cells and were randomly divided into one of two groups. One group of mice received water, which was the control group, and the other group was given bitter melon juice for six weeks. [6] Researchers studied the tumors at the end of the study and results showed that bitter melon juice not only inhibited cancer cell proliferation but also induced apoptosis (programmed cell death). Compared to the control, tumor growth was inhibited by 60% in the treatment group and there were no signs of toxicity or negative effects on the body. With toxicity and negative effects being a huge role in traditional mainstream treatments, this was positive to see. Diabetes A number of clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of bitter melon for treating diabetes. Since it is believed that diabetes is a precursor for pancreatic cancer, researchers felt bitter melon could treat diabetes as well after seeing pancreatic cancer results. In 2011, results of a four week long clinical trial were published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology that showed modest hypoglycemic effects and significant fructosamine management for those taking 2000mg/day of bitter melon. As published by the study: <U+201C>Bitter melon had a modest hypoglycemic effect and significantly reduced fructosamine levels from baseline among patients with type 2 diabetes who received 2,000 mg/day. However, the hypoglycemic effect of bitter melon was less than metformin 1,000 mg/day.<U+201D>[ 3 ] Another study published in 2008 in the international journal Chemistry and Biology indicated that compounds in bitter melon improved glycemic control, helped cells uptake glucose and improved overall glucose tolerance. This study was done in mice and led to promising advancements in treating diabetes and obesity with bitter melon.[ 4 ] In contrast, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology in 2007 did not show significant benefit of the treatment of diabetes by bitter melon but 2 years later in the British Journal of Nutrition it was stated that <U+201C>more, better-designed and clinical trials are required to confirm the fruit<U+2019>s role in diabetes treatment.<U+201D> Since that 2007 study, more studies have been done to show beneficial effects which perhaps was a result of better design. Conclusion When it comes to bitter melon juice, the current research available is showing strong results for specific types of cancer cell destruction, diabetes treatment and potential prevention of pancreatic cancer. Further research and clinical trials would be helpful to better understand how effective this plant can be and in what specific cases. It remains a very promising option that could be explored under the correct supervision. Other Uses of Bitter Melon Bitter melon has been used as a traditional medicine for a long time. It has been used to treat: colic, fever, burns, chronic cough, painful menstruation and skin conditions.[ 5 ]",

Decades of failure in Washington and decades of special interest dealing must and will come to an end.<U+201D> Story Continued Below Trump clarified at a rally later in the day that he would propose a six-year limit for members of the House and 12-year limit for senators. Trump, the Republican nominee, has recently refocused his campaign messaging on corruption in Washington. He<U+2019>s made policy proposals <U+2014> in addition to the term-limit amendment, he has called for new limits on lobbying by former members of Congress <U+2014> and also attacked his opponent, Hillary Clinton, claiming that she is too corrupt to run for president. Trump has also waded into the realm of conspiracy theories, making the unsubstantiated claim that the news media is conspiring with Clinton and other global forces to stop his election. He now regularly says on the campaign trail that the November election will be <U+201C>rigged.<U+201D> While congressional term limits have been part of conservative campaign platforms for decades (and this year's Libertarian ticket calls for them), Trump<U+2019>s talk about a <U+201C>rigged election<U+201D> has alarmed elected officials in both parties. There is no evidence to support the claim, but some of his supporters believe it, and Trump<U+2019>s critics say he is setting a dangerous precedent and undermining the legitimacy of American democratic institutions. President Barack Obama rebuked Trump on Tuesday, telling him to <U+201C>stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.<U+201D> But Trump said he was the only candidate who would <U+201C>end government corruption.<U+201D> To make that argument, Trump also drew attention to a new controversy facing his opponent, related to Clinton<U+2019>s use of private email server as secretary of state. By Ben Schreckinger Although the federal agencies deny that it happened, documents released by the FBI this week revealed an allegation that a State Department official offered a <U+201C>quid pro quo<U+201D> arrangement to convince the FBI to declassify one of Clinton<U+2019>s emails last year. However, the email<U+2019>s classification was not changed, and officials at the FBI and State said that no such deal had been offered or struck. Obama himself argued on Tuesday that the outrage at the accusation was overblown and not based in fact. Trump dismissed those objections, and called the alleged action <U+201C>felony corruption<U+201D> on Tuesday and said the State Department official, Patrick Kennedy, should be fired. And despite Obama<U+2019>s urging, Trump did not back down on his complaints that the election is <U+201C>rigged.<U+201D> He repeated his conspiracy theory that the news media is <U+201C>an extension of the Clinton campaign.<U+201D> By Michael Grunwald By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Jafe Arnoldski (noreply@blogger.com) \n source: fort-russ.com \n text: October 31, 2016 - Fort Russ -  Ruslan Ostashko, PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski - \n\n\nOnce again, the Ukrainian electorate is being taken for a grand ride and being stirred up. Whether unfortunately or fortunately, our information field overlaps with the raging infofield of our neighbors, and we have the opportunity to observe in real time the nervous breakdown of particularly impressionable citizens in neighboring Ukraine.  \nSome Russian connoisseurs take pleasure in this spectacle, and this are understandable. The point is that Western advisors have forced Ukrainian politicians and officials to declare their income and assets and open up testaments of this information for public access. Due to the primitiveness of the Ukrainian political class, which loves to steal a lot openly and is also full of confidence that nothing will happen, the contents of their declarations of assets was simply extravagant. \nSpeaking plainly, reading the declarations of the leaders of the Maidan leaves its supporters in depression or rage. Some people particularly sensitive in nature are going mad and falling into depression at the same time. They can also be understood. It<U+2019>s not pleasant for anyone to feel like a sucker and loser who has been let down in the most primitive way. \nIn this sense, Poroshenko<U+2019>s declaration of assets is not so impressive, since his wealth is already widely known. Some Ukrainians are even proud that Poroshenko is richer than Putin and many American presidents. But the declarations of ordinary members of the Ukrainian political class are shocking. \nFor example, Verkhovna Rada deputy Demchak, the deputy chairman of the committee regulating banking operations, revealed a bank account with 2,000 UAH and 133 million UAH in cash. Besides obvious questions as to the origins of this wealth, there<U+2019>s also the high trust which only a politician responsible for Ukrainian banks could have in the Ukrainian banking system.  \n133 million UAH in cash looks very patriotic because the rest of Ukrainian politicians also prefer cash, but dollars or euros, not gryvnia. \nThe declaration of Gontareva, the head of the National Bank of Ukraine, revealed $1.8 million and only 62,000 UAH. I think that all questions about the prospects of the Ukrainian currency<U+2019>s course can be left aside, as the question as to how Gontareva has this money is what will continue to excite inquisitive Ukrainian citizens.  \nIn general, Ukrainian officials<U+2019> declarations are reminiscent of fragments from the works of Ilf and Petrov about petty schemers who seized too much power. Formerly poor politicians suddenly find a collection of antique paintings, tons of cash money, antique books, jewelry, and large plots of land and shares in commercial companies.  \nThe reactions to all of this on social networks are also fascinating. For example, social network users write that the declarations <U+201C>destroyed faith in the country<U+201D> or dismayed them for having been sent to the ATO for <U+201C>the last 5 gryvnia<U+201D> while deputies were earning millions. Other users expect a <U+201C>short and merciless revolt<U+201D> which, this time, is supposed to bring genuinely honest professionals to power. \nPoliticians and their paid trolls are calling disgruntled citizens <U+201C>pinheads<U+201D> and demanding that they rejoice that they<U+2019>ve been allowed to see how the successful and hard-working leaders of the Maidan live, who have by leaps and bounds been leading Ukraine towards its bright European future. \nI am especially touched by those who sincerely believe that the asset declarations are a kind of silver bullet with which the Americans are killing Ukrainian corruption. This is nonsense. As a kind of humanitarian assistance to the fraternal Ukrainian people, I<U+2019>ll tell you why this happened and how it will end. \nLet<U+2019>s start with the most simple. No Maidan was needed to force deputies and officials to submit declarations. Seriously, not at all. In Russia, officials have long had to submit declarations and they are meticulously studied by relevant authorities and opposition activists. This is the first point. \nSecondly, the Americans are forcing Ukrainian officials to submit declarations not because they care about ordinary Ukrainians, but because they are trying to improve the culture of the colonial administration, i.e., take out of the picture those politicians who are too stupid to organize theft even by South American standards. Roughly speaking, the declarations made it clear why Poroshenko is president. At least he knows how to use offshore companies and doesn<U+2019>t stuff bags with cash. \nThirdly, those who think that the system of declaring assets is a guarantee that there will be no more corruption are very naive people. Similar systems exist in South America, Europe, Asia, and even Moldova. This system keeps complete idiots out of government, but makes little difference overall. \nFourthly, the only real benefit of this system is that those who are now offended over having received only 5 gryvnia can guess that these millions of euros and dollars in cash didn<U+2019>t fall to deputies from the sky, but came from giving others only 5 gryvnia. Unfortunately, people haven<U+2019>t realized this yet. Those who are outraged on social networks can<U+2019>t even use logic to remember that the <U+201C>vatniks<U+201D> and <U+201C>colorados<U+201D>  of Donbass warned them about this before. \nFifthly, there will be no revolt. No one was smart enough to set aside money for this, and color revolutions don<U+2019>t happen without money. Ukrainian politicians will continue to plunder their fellow citizens who, after the recent scandals, now believe that the fight against corruption is going at full speed<U+2026> \n\nFinally, judging by media reports, the Netherlands still haven't ratified the association agreement with Ukraine. There is the chance that studying the lists of Ukrainian politicians<U+2019> assets will distract Ukrainians from such sad thoughts. They will continue to believe that the Maidan was for the association agreement with the EU, not for the sake of Gontareva or Poroshenko<U+2019>s millions. This means that they still have a lot of surprises awaiting them. As long as they do not admit that they made a foolish mistake, the situation will not change for the better.  \n\n\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \n                                                   \n\n       Follow us on Twitter! \n                               \n\n             Donate! \n",

Marco Rubio, by tying him to the Republican presidential nominee, saying <U+201C>when Donald Trump goes low, Marco Rubio is right there with him.<U+201D> Murphy shared a stage with the Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Al Gore in pledging to combat climate change before a cheering crowd at the Kendall campus of Miami-Dade College.

And we are certainly not going to fight climate change with Donald Trump<U+2019>s misogynistic attacks. <U+201C>And where does Sen. Rubio stand?<U+201D> Murphy asked rhetorically. <U+201C>When Donald Trump goes low, Marco Rubio is right there with him.<U+201D> Making his first appearance of the presidential campaign with Clinton, Murphy called her the <U+201C>the most qualified person we<U+2019>ve ever had<U+201D> seek the office of the presidency. <U+201C>And you compare that to the most unqualified person we<U+2019>ve ever had seek that office,<U+201D> he said sarcastically in referring to Trump. Murphy praised Clinton, saying she will act quickly to combat climate change if elected to the White House. Clinton, who has endorsed Murphy, gave him a shout out later during her remarks to the mostly young college crowd of supporters. During his six-minute speech before Clinton and Gore commanded the stage, Murphy ticked off a litany of issues he would fight for if elected to the U.S. Senate. He said he would protect Social Security and Medicare, fix the <U+201C>broken<U+201D> immigration system and defend <U+201C>a woman<U+2019>s right to choose,<U+201D> along with making college <U+201C>more affordable.<U+201D> But the Jupiter congressman spent much of his short speech making blistering attacks against Trump and Rubio, and their environmental policies. <U+201C>With all that<U+2019>s at stake in this election, with the future of our environment and our country on the line, who are the Republicans trying to elect here in Florida? Donald Trump and Marco Rubio? Really? <U+201C>Senator Rubio stands with Donald Trump and refuses to protect our environment.

Look out your window. Okay? High tides are flooding the streets on Miami Beach. Yet he still refuses to act.\" Murphy has tried to link Rubio to Trump with little success so far in the U.S. Senate contest. He has struggled to connect with Hispanic voters and raise his name recognition against Rubio, a well-known and well-funded incumbent who jumped back into the Senate race after his GOP presidential bid ended in March. Nearly two dozen polls show Rubio in the driver<U+2019>s seat in leading the U.S. Senate race against Murphy, even though Trump trails Clinton in many of those same polls. Murphy exhorted the crowd dominated by millennials to get young people to the polls. \"Like so many of you here I'm millennial,\" said the 33-year-old Murphy. \"And it's up to this generation to reverse the trend that we are on.\" \"Let's make every phone call, let's knock on every door, let's stuff every envelope, and let's put in every hour it's going to take in November to win,\" he said before dashing off stage to the sound of loud applause.

Stewart (Common Sense column, front page, Nov. 18): I thought this article was extremely interesting and relevant, although one essential example was missing: a new power grid for the country. With modern renewable power sources dependent on intermittent conditions (sunshine for solar, wind for turbines), an imaginative new grid would be able to store energy for limited intervals, to be available whenever and wherever needed. This is a challenge we are capable of meeting with America<U+2019>s technical ingenuity. Perhaps an immigrant like Nikola Tesla will help solve it. FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA Rutherford, Calif. The writer is the film director, screenwriter and producer. To the Editor: Let<U+2019>s hope Donald Trump doesn<U+2019>t read James B. Stewart<U+2019>s suggestion to <U+201C>build something awe-inspiring.<U+201D> Do we really have to appeal to his sense of grandiosity in order to stimulate action? The result may well be a mega-golf course and resort in the center of Yellowstone Park, complete with the TRUMP logo. Repairing and improving the country<U+2019>s roads, bridges, federal buildings, national parks, energy and computer systems may not be glamorous, but such projects will generate well-paying employment instead of minimum-wage service jobs, and would leave a real (not a real-estate) and lasting legacy. DONNA BERGEN TOM MADDEN Skokie, Ill. To the Editor: I<U+2019>d like to add an item to the list of infrastructure projects suggested in the article: a coast-to-coast project to put all power and telephone lines underground. Such a project could employ more medium and low-skilled people than the construction of the Interstate Highway System did during the Eisenhower administration. It could be financed, at least partly, through the military budget as a national security measure that secures our power distribution systems against attack. And it would save untold millions of dollars year-in and year-out by avoiding the cost of power outages every time a storm hits. The current generation would thank President Donald Trump for the jobs and the boost to the economy, and generations to come would thank him for his foresight. Quite a legacy. MARC H.

They would have done it back in 1990 except for waffling by George H.W. Bush who had initially authorized the move and then rescinded approval, according to statements made by former Congressman Ron Paul, based on WikiLeaks State Department hacks. Saddam was blocked in 1990, and that may well have been a huge mistake on the part of everyone involved. When the US returned in 2003, it was Saudi cash that financed the Sunni Wahhabist was against the coalition government in Baghdad, a war that continues to this day, with the same cast of characters, the same Saudi cash, but they now call it <U+201C>ISIS.<U+201D> 5000 Americans died fighting Saudi paid jihadists. Saudi Arabia has always known that Iraq has only allowed them to continue their mischief so long as they served a purpose. When the war with Iran ended in 1988, that purpose had ended also. Saudi mischief in Iraq, playing tribe against tribe, pushing for Kurdish separatism and partnering with Israeli intelligence, ramped up as America scaled back her military presence under President Obama. By 2014, a logistics and command structure to destroy both Syria and Iraq had been established, headquartered in the Saudi embassies in Beirut and Amman and operating military operations centers, designed and built by the Israelis, at key locations in Turkey and quickly bolstered by satellite facilities across Iraq and Syria. The Saudi<U+2019>s were feeling time getting away from them, their decades of military buildup, based on endless oil and investment performance, no long sustainable. They had to knock out Syria and Iraq, using Israel, Turkey and NATO as surrogates, push the US into destroying Iran and cleanse Yemen of threats. They bribed everyone they got near. Were the Saudi<U+2019>s really the ones behind the Arab spring? Do we see the hands of Saudi Arabia when Israel channels Hamas fighters into the Yarmouk Camp, outside Damascus, to bolster ISIS forces? These are the telling events few see, but that prove the hypothesis and provide what is needed to predict a future that may well no longer include the Dark Kingdom. With a world obsessed with Islamic extremism and terror threats, why is no one looking at where it comes from, who finances, whose ideas are behind it and who it serves? With fingers pointing at the Mossad or CIA and so many others, the real issue is Wahhabism and the real root of it all is Saudi Arabia. There is no version of 9/11 that doesn<U+2019>t credit Saudi Mohammed Atta as planner of 9/11, whether assisted by Israeli art students or Osama bin Laden, depending on which theories you follow. The Saudi<U+2019>s did it and American civil courts are busy now assessing the damages. Oil money and sovereign immunity and, oh yes, control of the UN Human Rights Council, from which Russia was just expelled, protect them also, despite their abuses and love of head chopping. What is playing out now will lead only one direction, to a stronger Iraq, one under Shiite control with the economically powerful Sunni families, quietly migrating to their second homes in Dubai and Qatar. The crippled military the US saddled Iraq with will be gone, replaced by powerful Iranian trained militias. The American trained army joined ISIS. Had Prime Minister Maliki, back in 2014, been more aware of the threat, he would have moved against the Army. That, however, would have renewed the civil war, a war that could only have been ended with Iranian military intervention and Iran was still reeling with sanctions and the threat of American invasion. That threat is gone also. That world is gone, or soon will be as is being played out in Mosul and Aleppo. No one would have imagined Baghdad<U+2019>s resolve or the partnership between Russia and Iran. Still in question is Turkey<U+2019>s role. It is clear someone promised them Aleppo and Mosul, as is reflected in their military incursions into Syria and Iraq. If Saudi Arabia thinks Turkey will lift a hand to block Iraq<U+2019>s wrath, they are delusional. Turkey knows it can have peace with Iran and that both share similar ideas about the Kurds. This far outweighs any Turkish ambitions to the South. Turkey may well be planning a new Ottoman Empire, but Saudi Arabia is not in the cards for Turkish occupation. This leaves the protection of the United States and the upcoming election. Is there any American political leader that would oppose Iraq were they to hit Saudi Arabia, by 2020 or 2021? The prediction is that Iraq will come out of this war intact and, if they do, with a victorious army for the first time genuinely answerable to Baghdad and reeling from the battle of Mosul, likely to leave 20,000 civilians dead in its wake or more, the national enmity for Saudi Arabia will know no bounds. The Sunni gangsters from Anbar that aligned with the Saudis are mostly dead, many beheaded by ISIS. The promised Kurdish state in Erbil, the so-called <U+201C>Barzani Sultanate<U+201D> will not be handed control of the massive Kirkuk oil fields and the Ceyhan Pipeline by ISIS, as may well have been planned. Without these assets, Erbil will still enjoy a strong commercial presence but will never be able to reach into the Kurdish diaspora and bring the millions home and under questionable rule, subject to Erbil<U+2019>s deal making with everyone. Eventually Erbil will become a ghost town, the sons that returned will again migrate and Turkish ambitions, seemingly undone, will be fulfilled. As it appears now, Iraq will survive. Iraq also knows that what Saudi Arabia tried twice, they will try again and that the only way Iraq can be free is if Saudi Arabia falls. And then there is Iran.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Dmitry Babich, special to RBTH \n source: rbth.com \n text: russia-uk relations , uk , patriarch kirill , london Drawing by Alexei Iorsh Source: Iorsh \nAfter the Brexit referendum and the subsequent change of government in the UK, a number of experts and observers expected an improvement in Russo-British relations. Perhaps unwittingly, former British Prime Minister David Cameron inspired these unfounded expectations. Cameron<U+2019>s constantly repeated allegations that Russian President Vladimir Putin supported a vote for Brexit made people expect a somewhat softer line on Russia from the new governing team in London who were, after all, supporters of Brexit and opponents of Cameron. \nWhen Boris Johnson became the new foreign secretary, several MPs were even concerned about him not being <U+201C>tough enough<U+201D> with Russia and making <U+201C>conciliatory<U+201D> calls to his Russian counterpart, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. \nJohnson quickly proved these concerns wrong, issuing a call for protests near the Russian Embassy in London as a way to punish Moscow for its actions in Syria. <U+201C>This is something unprecedented in the world of diplomacy,<U+201D> Alexey Pushkov, former head of the Duma<U+2019>s committee on international affairs, said in an interview to Vesti FM radio station. <U+201C>A diplomat calling for non-diplomatic solutions, with popular anger mobilized <U+2013> this is something new.<U+201D> Pushkov also noted Johnson<U+2019>s tough statement accusing Russia of deliberately killing Syrian civilians with <U+201C>repeated bombings.<U+201D><U+201C>They drop one bomb and then they wait for the aid workers to come out pulling the injured from the rubble, and then five minutes later they drop another bomb,<U+201D> Boris Johnson said in an interview with the tabloid The Sun. \n<U+201C>Boris Johnson is showing a flamboyant attitude where it is needed least of all,<U+201D> Pushkov replied. \nFor their part, the Russian authorities, disappointed by Johnson, are also changing their tone, trying to drive home to both foreign and domestic audiences the message that they are angry. \n<U+201C>Decent people first provide the evidence, and only later they come out with accusations,<U+201D> said Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in response to Johnson<U+2019>s interview with The Sun. Seeing the bigger picture \nBoth Johnson and Zakharova have provided plenty of fodder for the media, but all commentary and posturing aside, the decline in Russo-British relations is detrimental not just for the two countries at hand, but also for global security at large. \n<U+201C>We should not forget that the world was once brought to the brink of a nuclear disaster not because of European problems, but because of a conflict over a distant land <U+2013> Cuba. When I hear British voices suggesting that NATO forces should impose a no-fly zone over northern Syria by striking at the airfields of the Syrian or Russian air forces in Syria <U+2013> I get really worried,<U+201D> Alexei Pushkov said. <U+201C>In this situation, tough statements with a strong populist message <U+2013> such as the talk about <U+201C>warning strikes<U+201D> in Syria <U+2013> such statements are not just tasteless, they are plain dangerous.<U+201D> Patriarch<U+2019>s visit to London hailed as step toward reconciliation with West Media tensions were somewhat eased by the visit to the UK by Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill. During his visit, which took place on Oct. 15-18, the Patriarch deliberately avoided controversial issues, playing down the conflict between the Russian and British governments. <U+201C>Political differences won<U+2019>t be able to disrupt the relations between Russia and Britain on the basic level, on the level of people-to-people ties,<U+201D> Patriarch Kirill said, speaking to journalists before his flight back to Moscow. <U+201C>I am often asked about our church<U+2019>s position on Ukraine. My answer is that there can be only one position: to reconcile the people, to lessen the tension, to end the bloody clashes.<U+201D>\nTrying to minimize the damage from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Russian Orthodox Church still recognizes Crimea as a canonical territory of its Ukrainian <U+201C>Orthodox sister church.<U+201D> For two years, Patriarch Kirill avoided any political comments on the recent <U+201C>regime change<U+201D> in Ukraine. When the Ukrainian government barred him from visiting Kiev, the cradle of Orthodox Christianity in ancient Rus, Kirill did not protest. In this way, the Russian Orthodox Church is offering a good example of forgiveness and compromise. Several British MPs protested against what they called a <U+201C>red carpet reception<U+201D> for Patriarch Kirill in London because of Kirill<U+2019>s loyalty to Putin, but the Patriarch did not pronounce a single word of anger or even sadness, meeting instead with Queen Elizabeth, the titular head of the Church of England, and blessing by his presence the opening of a renovated Orthodox cathedral in London. \n<U+201C>Since the early stages of deterioration of relations between Russia and the West, the church leaders have often been doing the diplomats<U+2019> jobs in Russia<U+2019>s relations with the West,<U+201D> wrote Moscow-based Nezavisimaya Gazeta, deviating from its usual line, which is very critical of Kirill. \nThis is perhaps not the worst of developments: at a time when diplomats are often sacrificing security and professionalism in order to boost their standing in the mass media, the church is trying to remember and celebrate the positive legacy of Russo-British relations. This is done not so much for the sake of history, as for the sake of a secure future. Sooner or later, this cursory attitude towards diplomacy will have to give way to wisdom and responsibility. \nDmitry Babich is a political analyst at Sputnik International. \nThe opinion of the writer may not necessarily reflect the position of RBTH or its staff.

If Donald Trump sparks one with China, among the losers will be some of his most ardent supporters: blue-collar workers who helped sweep him to election victory. In fact, they<U+2019>ll stand to lose twice. They<U+2019>ve already endured stagnant incomes for decades amid withering trade competition from China. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s threatened tariffs of 45% on all Chinese imports would hit their pocketbooks again by raising the price of pretty much everything on sale in Wal-Mart , from sneakers to microwave ovens. Nor is there convincing evidence that punitive tariffs would bring back jobs lost to China. The march of technology has altered the employment landscape. American factory workers are threatened more by automation than Chinese sweatshops. Derek Scissors, a trade specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, says that sanctions intended to compensate for manufacturing losses <U+201C>will cause Americans pain and bring little gain.<U+201D> Still, Mr. Trump is under pressure to take action against China<U+2014>even if it means imposing an effective tax on his political base<U+2014>after making its unfair trading practices a cornerstone of his campaign. He called it <U+201C>the greatest theft in world history.<U+201D> More than that, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s hard-line advisers see trade as a weapon in a broader geopolitical contest. Wall Street investors who blithely discount a trade war should read <U+201C>Crouching Tiger: What China<U+2019>s Militarism Means for the World,<U+201D> a book by a prominent member of this group, Peter Navarro, an economist at the University of California, Irvine. In buying made-in-China products, he writes, <U+201C>We as consumers are helping to finance a Chinese military buildup,<U+201D> warning that <U+201C>we will have only ourselves to blame when the bullets and missiles begin to fly.<U+201D> The same advisers are urging Mr. Trump to label China a currency manipulator for suppressing the value of the yuan to boost exports<U+2014>even though Beijing is burning through its foreign-exchange reserves to do the opposite, prop up the yuan as it battles capital flight in a slowing economy. If the U.S. turns inward, China will seize an opportunity. Immediately after Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election, which doomed a U.S.-led free-trade pact, China announced it would seek support for its own regional trade deal at gathering of Asia-Pacific leaders in Peru this week. Whether, or how, Mr. Trump follows through on his trade threats will offer early clues to an unsettled question: Is he an isolationist or a foreign-policy hawk? His <U+201C>America First<U+201D> campaign rhetoric, and vows to make allies pay more for their defense, suggested a U.S. pullback from East Asia. But his advisers are now pushing an alternative concept called <U+201C>peace through strength,<U+201D> which is a souped-up version of President Barack Obama <U+2019>s <U+201C>pivot<U+201D> to Asia that involves a major buildup of the U.S. Navy. These radically conflicting visions have disoriented East Asia, where the one certainty since World War II has been the steadying hand of America. On Monday, Mr. Trump spoke by phone with President Xi Jinping. His office said the two men had established a <U+201C>clear sense of mutual respect.<U+201D> Chinese state media cited Mr. Xi as saying that cooperation is the <U+201C>sole correct choice.<U+201D> Chinese leaders hope Mr. Trump will act like a businessman<U+2014>pragmatic, transactional, open to what they call <U+201C>win-win<U+201D> solutions (U.S. executives in China quip that this generally means <U+201C>China wins twice.<U+201D>) East Asian countries demand a U.S. president who will stand up to China. Yet none want a trade war. It would shatter economies like South Korea and Taiwan that feed China<U+2019>s manufacturing supply chains. A smarter U.S. approach, argues Mr. Scissors, would be targeted measures such as banning Chinese companies that benefit from stolen intellectual property. These wouldn<U+2019>t damage the U.S., he says, but might change Chinese behavior. Assessing which side would lose most in a trade confrontation is tricky. China can ill afford a massive loss of foreign-exchange earnings. Corporate America is vulnerable to retaliation. The nationalist-leaning Global Times, in an opinion piece, suggested how this might play out: <U+201C>A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus . U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted.<U+201D> But that scenario cuts both ways. A report by the Rhodium Group, a New York market-research firm, estimates that U.S. firms have invested at least $228 billion in Chinese companies since 1990<U+2014>about three times higher than previous estimates and well above investments from Chinese companies in the U.S., which Rhodium puts at $64 billion, about 1.5 to four times the currently accepted figure. Daniel Rosen, who heads Rhodium<U+2019>s China practice, says that <U+201C>many basic assumptions about who wins and who loses in a U.S.-China dust-up are not grounded in facts.<U+201D> He adds: <U+201C>The costs on both sides are likely much higher than previously thought.<U+201D> Sweeping sanctions<U+2014>assuming Republicans in Congress go along with them, by no means a given<U+2014>all but guarantee panic in global financial markets, supply-chain mayhem across the Pacific Rim and even deeper pain among the working class that Mr. Trump has pledged to rescue.

Too sick, in fact, to run for president. \nHowever, I can guarantee you that the second this email got released, Hillary gave the kill order to her media goons to bury this story so deep that it will never see the light of day. \nIf you want the world to see how Broken Hillary Clinton really is, then do us all a favor and share this out to everyone you know on Facebook. This is our ONLY way to get the truth out there!",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Kelly Crow \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/art-world-speculates-about-trumps-artistic-tastes-1480351356 \n text: Donald Trump is known for speaking and tweeting what<U+2019>s on his mind but hasn<U+2019>t revealed much about his taste in art. That has museums, galleries and private collectors guessing what the president-elect will display in the White House. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s relationship to the art world is complex. On the one hand, the billionaire businessman<U+2019>s brand is linked to luxurious flourishes and visual sumptuousness. Yet art dealers say Mr. Trump isn<U+2019>t a fixture at high-end auctions or art fairs, and he doesn<U+2019>t use the properties that bear his name to showcase contemporary artists such as Jeff Koons as some other developers do. Magazine profiles of the Trumps<U+2019> $100 million New York penthouse indicate that the president-elect and his wife, Melania, favor 18th-century French style with gilded finishes and marble walls as well as painted ceilings and sculptures featuring mythological gods like Apollo, Eros and Psyche. Mrs. Trump<U+2019>s home office recently displayed a reproduction of <U+201C>Theater Box,<U+201D> an 1874 portrait of a couple by Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The original hangs in London<U+2019>s Courtauld Gallery. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s older daughter, Ivanka , has worked with New York art adviser Alex Marshall to collect rising stars like Nate Lowman, who paints oversize, comic-book-style bullet holes, and Alex Israel, whose canvases resemble pastel skies. Once Mr. Trump takes office, he and his Cabinet will be allowed to sift through the White House<U+2019>s permanent collection or seek art loans from museums on the National Mall and beyond. The first couple also could hang up pieces from one of their homes. The Trumps could affect the market values of artists they display<U+2014>and at the same time send political messages with their choices. Bill Clinton earned praise for picking Simmie Knox , who is African-American, to paint the White House portraits of the president and first lady. President George W. Bush<U+2019>s administration was hailed for acquiring <U+201C>The Builders,<U+201D> by African-American artist Jacob Lawrence, though some criticized the move because the painting depicts black men doing menial labor. A spokeswoman for William Allman, the White House<U+2019>s longtime curator, said it is too soon to know whether Mr. Trump or members of his cabinet will seek to borrow or swap out art for their offices. If so, Mr. Allman will help them draw up wish lists and send loan requests to museums, likely after the inauguration. The White House declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the White House Historical Association, the nonprofit that preserves and buys art for the White House, said new presidents usually redecorate their upstairs residences and the Oval Office within their first year of taking office. The spokeswoman, Lara Kline, added that Congress sets aside $100,000 for the purpose. Some works are likely keepers because past presidents have displayed them, regardless of their political leanings, Ms. Kline said. Paintings with bipartisan appeal include Gilbert Stuart<U+2019>s 1797 portrait of George Washington that hangs in the East Room and George P.A. Healy<U+2019>s 1869 portrait of Abraham Lincoln above the mantel in the State Dining Room. The current president and first lady brought in bold, abstract works<U+2014>including Glenn Ligon<U+2019>s text piece about segregation, <U+201C>Black Like Me #2,<U+201D> which departed sharply from the 19th-century still lifes and pastoral scenes in the White House<U+2019>s public rooms. Two years ago, Alma Thomas became the first female African-American artist to enter the White House collection after Michelle Obama asked the historical association to buy <U+201C>Resurrection,<U+201D> Ms. Thomas<U+2019>s rainbow-hue painting that evokes a target. <U+201C>The Obamas brought a modern aesthetic,<U+201D> Ms. Kline added. Elizabeth Feld, whose Hirschl & Adler Galleries in New York sell high-end antiques and classical paintings, said Mr. Trump likely will try to set a presidential tone now by displaying works that <U+201C>make him look regal and strong, something with eagles or worthy heroes like Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Jefferson.<U+201D> Adam Williams, a New York-based seller of European Old Master paintings, said Mr. Trump tends to decorate with reproductions rather than antiques<U+2014>but he hopes the new president will come to appreciate the originals on site. (Much of the French furniture in the White House was bought during James Monroe<U+2019>s administration.) <U+201C>You don<U+2019>t want a Koons on the wall of the Oval Office,<U+201D> Mr. Williams said. <U+201C>You want calm and soothing.<U+201D> Write to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.com",

Dangerous in his certitude about what he doesn<U+2019>t know. Dangerous in his ignorance of history, his antipathy toward reading, his inability to sort fact from fiction. The last man to play things by the gut while in control of the world<U+2019>s most powerful military left a mortal mess. But welcome, for now, President-elect Donald Trump. It feels, in much of the nation, like the death of a loved one <U+2014> the sudden, unexpected kind. I haven<U+2019>t felt this way since the nuns told our second-grade class that John F. Kennedy had been assassinated. Still, grief is an emotion that has little power in politics. A majority <U+2014> well, not from the popular vote, which Hillary Clinton won <U+2014> chose radical change over reasoned predictability. They<U+2019>re going to get plenty of change, much of it chaotic and cruel. Those who think Trump can be contained, or trained by seasoned K Street hacks to act reasonable, are deluding themselves. He<U+2019>ll do it his way. The Republicans will control everything, including the Supreme Court. Washington is theirs, with minimal checks and balances. And if the forgotten, the undereducated, the Rust Belt survivors think they are going to see a renaissance of their communities, consider this headline from Yahoo Finance on the day after the election: <U+201C>Trump win is a <U+2018>grand slam<U+2019> for Wall Street Bankers.<U+201D> He will not betray his class. But resistance is not futile. Within the durable strength of the Constitution are many options <U+2014> peaceful, legal, effective countermoves, not the burn-it-all down schemes of the Trumpsters, had Clinton won. One question is existential: Can the world survive the 45th American president? When he looks the other way while Russia takes a small country, we can remind him that the United States signed a treaty with war-broken European allies that cannot be dismissed by fiat. When he orders the generals to torture suspects, kill family members of suspected terrorists, they can cite Geneva Conventions <U+2014> something the generals know much more about than Trump. The State Department, which usually tries to be a force for good, advocating human rights over bottom lines, cannot be easily pressed into aiding the globe<U+2019>s gangsters and oligarchs, even if Newt Gingrich is secretary of state. When Trump takes away people<U+2019>s health care, when he tries to reinstate a system that was not, in fact, fabulous for those with pre-existing conditions, he will find a constituency of people who are one medical bill from bankruptcy. They will have to shout to be heard above the lobbyists, but they won<U+2019>t go away quietly. When Trump tries to ignore the provisions of a global accord to curb climate change, and charts a path for the United States as a rogue nation, the resistance will come from the millions of young Americans who found a voice in old Bernie Sanders. They will be similarly roused when he attempts to let the despoilers have their way on public land. Millennials will learn the hard way that failure to turn out in sufficient numbers at election time could cost their children a habitable planet. The wall will not be built, nor will it be paid for by Mexico. It<U+2019>s absurdly expensive, and unworkable. It was always a ruse. Instead, Trump will stage a photo op in Arizona, and, noting a net out-migration pattern started under President Obama, declare victory. Same with the authoritarian plan to round up 11 million people, tearing families apart. He<U+2019>ll be stopped by majority sentiment, appalled at a police state in neighborhoods. Speaking of people power, the gloomiest of progressives should look at what voters did at the ballot box <U+2014> measures that a Republican Congress never would do. Gun-safety initiatives, some of them quite strong, passed all over the West, even the wilder parts, as in Nevada, where the National Rifle Association spent $4 million in a losing cause. These new laws are designed, in general, to keep unstable people from getting military-style weapons <U+2014> something that is also backed by a majority of the people. In red and blue states, a hefty raise in the minimum wage was instituted through the ballot box. Congress won<U+2019>t even consider giving many of Trump<U+2019>s most ardent supporters a boost in their wages, but those measures passed in all four states where they were offered. The strongest resistance should come from the white working class; they will soon find out that Trump will treat them the same way he treated the suckers who signed up for his fraudulent university. When steel mills fail to return to Youngstown, or when new trade deals produce no more magic than the old ones, these economic exiles will wonder how they got betrayed. Look to the euphoria of soon-to-be deregulated Wall Street bankers for your explanation. Finally, all of us in the American family should never trust anyone from the pollster industrial complex, including those at my own newspaper. Never.

Bender Damian Paletta \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-picks-nikki-haley-as-ambassador-to-u-n-1479907831 \n text: President-elect Donald Trump has chosen the first women for posts in his administration, picking South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and school-choice advocate Betsy DeVos as his secretary of education, his transition team said Wednesday. Ms. Haley long held reservations about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s candidacy during the GOP primary, and endorsed both Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz during the primary. But both sides seemed to have warmed to each other after Mr. Trump won the Nov. 8 election. U.N.<U+00A0>ambassador<U+00A0>is<U+00A0>a key post, advising the White House on foreign policy issues and representing the U.S. in discussions with other countries. Ms. DeVos , 58 years old, a former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman, would enter the office when traditional public schools are fighting charter schools for students, as enrollment drives state and local funding. Some school districts, including the Los Angeles Unified School District, have reported losing thousands of students and millions of dollars. Charter schools, publicly funded campuses that are mostly privately run, are the fastest-growing educational option. Charter enrollment grew 219% from 2004 to 2014 to more than 2.5 million students, while school-district enrollment dropped by 1%, according to an analysis of the latest data from the National Center for Education Statistics. <U+201C>Together, we can work to make transformational change to ensure every student has the opportunity to fulfill his or her highest potential,<U+201D> Ms. DeVos wrote Wednesday on Twitter, adding that the <U+201C>status quo<U+201D> in education is <U+201C>not acceptable.<U+201D> Ms. Haley, 44, is a two-term governor who is perhaps best known for leading the push to remove the Confederate Flag from the State Capitol grounds in 2015 following a mass shooting at a church in Charleston. <U+201C>Governor Haley has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said in a statement. <U+201C>She is also a proven deal maker, and we look to be making plenty of deals. She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage.<U+201D> Also Wednesday, former GOP presidential candidate and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson suggested in a social-media post that he would join the Trump administration , reversing his stance last week that he didn<U+2019>t want to work in government. His spokesman Armstrong Williams said Mr. Carson was being considered to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Carson wrote on his Facebook page that <U+201C>after serious discussions with the Trump transition team, I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone.<U+201D> He added: <U+201C>An announcement is forthcoming about my role in helping to make America great again.<U+201D> In selecting Ms. Haley, Mr. Trump has picked someone who is well-known within the Republican Party but is less well-known for her views on key foreign policy issues. One exception came in September 2015, when she signed a letter with 14 other GOP governors expressing opposition to the Iran nuclear deal reached by the White House and several other countries. Her views are less well-known on countries like North Korea and Russia, two nations that are often the focus of U.N. discussions. <U+201C>Our country faces enormous challenges here at home and internationally, and I am honored that the President-elect has asked me to join his team and serve the country we love as the next Ambassador to the United Nations,<U+201D> Gov. Haley said in a statement. Ms. Haley<U+2019>s appointment could clear the way for South Carolina Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster to become the state<U+2019>s next leader. Mr. McMaster was one of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s earliest endorsers, agreeing to back the candidate in January. Ms. Haley<U+2019>s appointment must be confirmed by the Senate. Ms. Haley received support from Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, a conservative lawyers network, and a U.S. delegate to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in 2005. <U+201C>Gov. Nikki Haley will bring the right principles and priorities to the job of U.N. ambassador,<U+201D> Mr. Leo said. <U+201C>Having served as a governor, she will be able to spot instances where the U.N. is seeking to curb the sovereign interests of our country. She is committed to human dignity and will be able to push back on U.N. agendas that elevate abortion over the real human and civil rights atrocities that occur in dictatorships around the world.<U+201D> South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison congratulated Ms. Haley on the appointment, but said there were some risks. <U+201C>I must note with concern, however, that every single previous U.N. ambassador came to the job with previous foreign policy experience, which Gov. Haley lacks,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>I hope the governor is a quick study because as one of the nation<U+2019>s top diplomats, she will have the critical task of dealing in real time with virtually every international crisis that arises.<U+201D> <U+2014>Tawnell D.

Kellyanne Conway said Kaine<U+2019>s debate performance Tuesday night was <U+201C>terrible<U+201D> in no small part because of his repeated interruptions of moderator Elaine Quijano.

It's the word that the left and the Democrats and Hillary Clinton folks love to employ against everyone who doesn't support her. If you don't support Hillary Clinton, you're a sexist,<U+201D> Conway replied. <U+201C>So why in the world was her running mate interrupting and ignoring the female moderator, Asian-American female moderator by the way, completely? It was almost like it was a strategy. It was almost like he didn't hear her. And it came off terribly on TV.<U+201D> Conway went on to attack Kaine over his exchange with Pence on the issue of abortion. She labeled the Virginia senator<U+2019>s talking point, that the GOP ticket is anti-women because it is anti-abortion, as stale and added that <U+201C>abortion is like a religion to many<U+201D> in the media. <U+201C>Tim Kaine was trying to go there and pretend that Donald Trump and Mike Pence are against women,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>They talk about women's issues and it's really euphemism for abortion, or they'll talk about women's health and they really mean abortion. So forcing them to even say that word <U+2014> we at the Trump-Pence campaign think all issues are women's issues.<U+201D> By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

Bernstein said : \n<U+201C>Well, there<U+2019>s no question that the e-mails have always been the greatest threat to her candidacy for president, that her conduct in regard to the e-mails is really indefensible and . . . the one thing . . . actually that could really perhaps affect this election. \nWe don<U+2019>t know what this means yet except that it<U+2019>s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly . . . unless it was something requiring serious investigation . . . . I want to add here that in the last, oh, 36, 48 hours, there has been an undercurrent of kind of speculative discussion among some national security people that something might surface in the next few days about e-mails. . . . [I]t<U+2019>s very possible that some members of Congress very quickly are going to get an idea of what these e-mails are, and what this is all about, and for whatever purpose put some information out there.<U+201D> \nSo if the Clintons <U+201C>offed<U+201D> Bob Woodward for calling the Clinton Foundation <U+201C>corrupt,<U+201D> then Carl Bernstein would have to be offed as well. \nSee also:",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Edward Hunt \n source: antiwar.com \n text: Share This \nIn recent months, a number of U.S. officials have begun to reassess their understanding of why the North Korean government wants nuclear weapons. Rather than repeating the standard claim that the North Korean government is taking extreme measures to intimidate its enemies into making concessions, some officials have begun to suggest that the North Korean government desires nuclear weapons for defensive purposes. \nAfter the North Korean government conducted its fifth underground nuclear test on September 9, 2016, former US official Victor Cha presented the new line of thinking. <U+201C>This is not a cry for negotiations,<U+201D> Cha told The New York Times . <U+201C>This is very clearly a serious effort at amassing real nuclear capabilities that they can use to deter the US and others.<U+201D> \nA few days later, Cha shared the same logic with a subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. <U+201C>Testing was once interpreted by pundits to be an attention-getting effort for dialogue with the United States,<U+201D> but <U+201C>it would be irresponsible today to adhere to such an interpretation,<U+201D> Cha stated . In today<U+2019>s world, <U+201C>North Korea is executing a strategy designed to demonstrate a survivable nuclear deterrent before the next US administration comes into office.<U+201D> In short, Cha insisted that the North Korean government sought to acquire nuclear weapons for the purpose of deterring its enemies. \nThreat or No Threat? \nOf course, not everyone in Washington agrees with such thinking. Although Cha and other strategic analysts have proposed that the North Korean government is rationally pursuing a nuclear deterrent to defend itself against the United States, high-level officials in Washington insist that nothing could be further from the truth. \nNotably, Secretary of State John Kerry has refuted the idea that the North Korean government needs to take defensive measures. For <U+201C>any person of common sense,<U+201D> the answer to the question of whether the North Korean government has to defend itself against the United States is <U+201C>no,<U+201D> Kerry announced on October 19, 2016. <U+201C>Everybody knows that.<U+201D> \nAfter making his point, Kerry then insisted that the United States posed no threat to North Korea because the US government has made no recent efforts to destroy the country. <U+201C>The United States has had the power to wipe out North Korea for years <U+2013> for years,<U+201D> Kerry noted. <U+201C>And if indeed that was our goal, we wouldn<U+2019>t be sitting around waiting while they<U+2019>re getting additional nuclear weapons.<U+201D> \nCertainly, US officials have not recently attempted to wipe out North Korea. Although the United States had once destroyed most of North Korea during the Korean War, when it spent three years carpet-bombing the country and destroying most North Korean cities, US officials have not resorted to comparable tactics in the country since the armistice ended the fighting in 1953. \nAt the same time, US officials have continued to take other actions to pressure, marginalize, and isolate North Korea. For starters, US officials have worked with their allies to impose restrictive sanctions on the country. Certainly, <U+201C>we<U+2019>re always looking at ways we can continue to apply pressure,<U+201D> State Department Spokesperson Mark C. Toner acknowledged during a press briefing on July 19, 2016. In fact, <U+201C>the sanctions are pretty severe right now.<U+201D> \nTwo months later, White House official Ben Rhodes made a similar point, only providing more emphasis. <U+201C>So we<U+2019>ve passed now through the U.N. Security Council the strongest sanctions ever on North Korea,<U+201D> Rhodes stated . The sanctions are <U+201C>having an impact<U+201D> and <U+201C>putting a tighter squeeze on North Korea.<U+201D> \nTo put an even tighter squeeze on North Korea, US officials have also made it clear that they are ready to take more direct action. Taking advantage of their extraordinary military power in the region, including the 28,500 US soldier s that are stationed in South Korea, US officials have continually reminded the North Korean government that they are ready to resume the Korean War at a moment<U+2019>s notice. \nOn the day that the North Korean government conducted its fifth underground nuclear test, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter made the point by stating that <U+201C>US forces on the Korean Peninsula are always ready, and this is true every single day, to fight tonight.<U+201D> \nA few days later, US officials then sent an even more powerful signal of their preparedness, flying two nuclear-capable B-1B bombers over South Korea in a display of military power. As US General Vincent K. Brooks explained at the time, US officials wanted to demonstrate their commitment to using their <U+201C>full range of military capabilities,<U+201D> such as nuclear weapons. \nExpect Serious Consequences \nBy applying constant pressure to North Korea, US officials have sent another powerful message to the North Korean government. Although officials in Washington may deny that they are threatening North Korea, they have made it clear that the North Korean government can expect to face serious consequences for continuing to defy the United States with its nuclear weapons program. \n<U+201C>What I can tell you is our policy, with respect to North Korea<U+2019>s provocations and the resolve of the United States and the international community to try to put adequate pressure on them to change their behavior, has not changed and remains the same,<U+201D> State Department Spokesperson John Kirby confirmed on October 25, 2016. \nEven so, some officials are now providing another way of understanding the situation. On the same day that Kirby made his statement, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper indicated that the United States has ultimately left the North Korean government with no serious alternatives. <U+201C>I think the notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause,<U+201D> Clapper stated . <U+201C>They are not going to do that. That is their ticket to survival.<U+201D> Indeed, Clapper indicated that the North Korean government would find it necessary to maintain a powerful nuclear arsenal in order to deter the constant threats it faces from the United States. \n<U+201C>And I got a good taste of that when I was there, about how the world looks from their vantage,<U+201D> Clapper added. <U+201C>And they are under siege and they are very paranoid.<U+201D> \nIn short, a number of US officials are now beginning to come to terms with one of the main reasons why the North Korean government is making such a major effort to acquire nuclear weapons. These officials are starting to believe that the North Korean government is working to build an arsenal of nuclear weapons to create a powerful deterrent against the United States. \nEdward Hunt writes about war and empire.

That doesn<U+2019>t sound like much, but it is a long way from the -15 bps it yielded a couple of months ago. Meanwhile, world equity markets more or less looked the other way, although they were slightly lower. The early going here saw the market modestly weaker as well, and acting funky enough that I put on a few shorts<U+2026> IMPORTANT: To find out which company Doug Casey, Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that already has a staggering 18.1 million ounces of gold that just added another massive deposit and is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest gold opportunities in the world <U+2013> CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored \nAround midday the leakage accelerated somewhat and the market was 0.5% lower by early afternoon. With a couple of hours to go, when I had to leave, the decline was about 0.75% (but it felt like it might accelerate, so check the box scores). Away from stocks, green paper was a bit weaker, led by a bounce in the euro, oil lost 1%, fixed income was a bit lower, and the metals came to life, led by silver, which popped 3% to gold<U+2019>s 1%. The miners similarly had a pretty strong day, just as they did yesterday. I didn<U+2019>t note Monday<U+2019>s action because I was suspicious it might have something to do with end-of-the-month tape painting, but obviously that was not the case. \nGold Dog, New Tricks Given the fact that the Bank of Japan did nothing new and the Fed is expected to make hawkish comments tomorrow regarding a December rate hike, it was an interesting time for the metals to pop. I<U+2019>m sure today<U+2019>s action has a number of people scratching their head as to how this could be. And I have to admit, I thought there was little chance for gold to start moving until we got past tomorrow<U+2019>s promise from Fed heads to hike rates, assuming the data continues to be, in their words, <U+201C>strong enough<U+201D> (a phrase that is naturally open to subjective interpretation on their part). Having said that, I don<U+2019>t feel there is going to be a hike because I don<U+2019>t think the stock market or the economy are going to cooperate. \nMake It Stop There is also the wild card of the election next week and despite the mainstream media and the polls suggesting that Trump is a long shot, I think the tally will be much closer and his chance of winning is nontrivial, although certainly not expected. I mention that because, were Trump to win, I think a lot of markets would be put in motion. \nThe stock market has been an accident waiting to happen, and considering how much Wall Street seems to be enamored of a Clinton victory, an upset would probably be enough of a catalyst to send the indices tumbling, which by extension would be a positive for gold <U+2014> and take a rate hike off the table. On the other hand, in the event Hillary wins, I don<U+2019>t think the stock market could really go up much. \nIn any event, I don<U+2019>t want to get into too much of a discussion about what is liable to happen, as we will have the data in a few days and can decide exactly what to do in the wake of it from a stock market perspective. Besides, a precious metals position can do well under any number of potential scenarios we may see, and they may have already discounted a rate hike, which we probably won<U+2019>t get. Included below are three questions and answers from the Q&A<U+2019>s with Bill Fleckenstein. Bonus Q&A Question: If the bond market has <U+201C>topped<U+201D>, isn<U+2019>t it irrelevant who wins the Presidency. In other words the bond market will be in full control and politicians will be late and simply be responding with desperate measures? Answer from Fleck: <U+201C> Yes, the President is irrelevant to a large degree versus the bond market.<U+201D> Question: Dear Bill, Happy Halloween! If you were going to dress as something scary for Halloween would it be<U+2013> a) deflation, b) a creepy clown, or c) one of the presidential candidates. Of course b) and c) aren<U+2019>t mutually exclusive, since clowns can be either gender<U+2026> Answer from Fleck: <U+201C> If I was going out to a party, I would dress as Mr. Politically Incorrect, and I<U+2019>d try to wear a small bit of any/every costume that is deemed to be <U+201C>offensive,<U+201D> (i.e. part Chinese, Japanese, black, Arab, gay, trans, Indian, Mexican, angry clown, Hitler, etc.) I am so sick of microagression and related censorship. We have a right to free speech in this country, but there is no right to <U+201C>not be offended.<U+201D> People need to get over themselves. We have far bigger problems in this country than being offended.<U+201D> Question: Yesterday you wrote <U+201C>as the belief that the central planners have accomplished what they set out to, nothing can go wrong, and the election will go whichever way it needs to for us to live happily ever after.<U+201D> I think the S&P 500 being flat for 22 months with fits and starts says something doesn<U+2019>t it? Frustrating for bulls and bears alike. Answer from Fleck: <U+201C> Yeah, it does say something, which is, <U+201C>without QE, the stock market can<U+2019>t go up.<U+201D> *** To subscribe to Bill Fleckenstein<U+2019>s fascinating Daily Thoughts CLICK HERE. \n***KWN has now released the remarkable audio interview with Nomi Prins CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. \n***ALSO RELEASED: Today<U+2019>s Upside Move In Gold Is Nothing Compared To What Is Coming CLICK HERE. \n***KWN has also released Rick Rule<U+2019>s timely audio interview CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. \n<U+00A9> 2015 by King World News<U+00AE>.

        "input": "time: null \n author: MAX FISHER \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/world/americas/donald-trump-foreign-policy.html?_r=0 \n text: Whether or not Donald J. Trump follows through on his campaign pledges to diminish or possibly abandon American commitments to security alliances such as NATO, his election victory forces nations around the world to begin preparing for the day they can no longer count on the American-backed order. This creates a danger that derives less from Mr. Trump<U+2019>s words, which are often inconsistent or difficult to parse, than from the inability to predict his actions or how other states might respond to them. That uncertainty puts pressure on allies and adversaries alike to position themselves, before Mr. Trump even takes office, for a world that could be on the verge of losing one of its longest-standing pillars of stability. <U+201C>You<U+2019>re going to see a lot of fear among America<U+2019>s allies, and in some cases they may try to do something about it,<U+201D> said James Goldgeier, a political scientist and the dean of American University<U+2019>s School of International Service. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election comes at a moment when rising powers are already pushing against the American-led order: China in Asia, Iran in the Middle East, and particularly Vladimir V. Putin<U+2019>s Russia in Europe. Those powers will be tempted to test their new limits. Allies in Europe or Asia, suddenly considering the prospect of facing a hostile power alone, cannot wait to see whether Mr. Trump means what he says, Mr. Goldgeier said, adding that they <U+201C>will have to start making alternate plans now.<U+201D> Western European states like Germany and France <U+201C>may decide they can no longer afford to take a tough stand against Putin<U+2019>s Russia,<U+201D> he suggested. <U+201C>They may decide their best bet is to cut some kind of deal with him,<U+201D> even if it means tolerating Russian influence over Eastern Europe. Or they may not. But that possibility <U+2014> and the fact that Eastern European states may have to worry, and plan accordingly <U+2014> shows how uncertainty can build on itself, adding instability to already tumultuous regions. Over the past year, I have been asking policy experts to evaluate Mr. Trump<U+2019>s likely foreign policy, and they have consistently given me the same answer: They are unable to stitch Mr. Trump<U+2019>s rambling speeches and scant white papers into a coherent worldview. That lack of clarity seemed purely academic when polls predicted a sweeping victory for his rival, Hillary Clinton. Now, it is a problem shared by world leaders, friendly and unfriendly, who had long planned their foreign policies around the role reliably played by the United States. Instead, countries must prepare for a very unfamiliar world, one whose most powerful nation and global guarantor is no longer so easy to predict. Even if they believe that the United States-led order will most likely remain, they have little choice but to hedge against its disintegration <U+2014> acting as if the world had already returned to a bygone era of shifting alliances and regional spheres of power. The difficulty of predicting Mr. Trump<U+2019>s foreign policy could create other forms of destabilizing uncertainty. Asked about the international agreement to restrict Iran<U+2019>s nuclear program , Daryl G. Kimball, director of the Arms Control Association, said it was unclear to him <U+2014> and most likely to Middle Eastern leaders <U+2014> whether Mr. Trump <U+201C>would deliberately or inadvertently take actions that unravel that agreement.<U+201D> Because Middle Eastern countries would so struggle to predict or plan around Mr. Trump<U+2019>s Iran policies, and because he seems thus far unlikely to win over European leaders whom he has insulted from the campaign trail, Mr. Kimball said, <U+201C>the future of the Iran deal is now in greater jeopardy.<U+201D> While Mr. Kimball doubted that renewed Iranian nuclear development would inspire other Middle Eastern states to seek their own nuclear programs, the region<U+2019>s turmoil seems likely to worsen if American-brokered restrictions fall away. Some states, rather than reconciling with the threats from which the United States currently protects them, could consider extreme steps to protect themselves without American help. Mr. Kimball worried that South Korea, for example, could inch closer to developing its own nuclear weapons program. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s threats to withdraw American troops from the country, and North Korea<U+2019>s growing nuclear and missile programs, <U+201C>could be a tipping point,<U+201D> Mr. Kimball said. Smaller states will face even harder choices. <U+201C>If you<U+2019>re in the Baltics, you now have no idea whether you can count on the U.S. if Putin makes a move,<U+201D> Mr. Goldgeier said, referring to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s suggestions that he might not fulfill American treaty obligations to defend a NATO ally such as Estonia from Russian aggression. Similar dynamics could play out in Asia, where countries like the Philippines and Malaysia are already straining to balance the United States and a rising China. If American support looks less assured, then China becomes more attractive. Such defections would fracture the region<U+2019>s relatively pro-American unity, allowing Beijing to assert a greater role, for example in the heavily disputed South China Sea. China is still too weak to dominate the region outright, though, risking years of competition that would not necessarily be peaceful. Mr. Goldgeier said it was impossible to predict what precisely would happen, because Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plans are broadly unknown and because it is difficult to guess how the world would meet drastic changes in the American role. Mostly, we know what he opposes: <U+201C>There<U+2019>s no indication that Donald Trump wants to continue the kind of foreign policy that the U.S. has followed since World War II,<U+201D> he said. Whatever path he takes, Mr. Goldgeier added, <U+201C>it<U+2019>s going to be very different.<U+201D> Follow Max Fisher on Twitter @Max_Fisher .

While winning the popular vote would not in itself guarantee a Trump victory, if IBD / TIPP is once again accurate and Trump has a 2% or greater margin in the popular vote, it would far more likely than not he would also catapult above the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the Presidency. \nIBD<U+2019>s polling partner TechnoMetrica uses <U+201C>traditional<U+201D> telephone methodology using live interviewers for data collection for its public opinion surveys. Roughly 65% of interviews come from a cell phone sample and 35% from a Random Digit Dial (RDD) land line sample. \nIBD<U+2019>s result is a outlier if you compare it to polls conducted by network as CBS News, ABC, NBC and Fox News have Clinton up between 1 and 4% in their final pre-Election polls. \nHowever, today<U+2019>s LA Times / USC poll has Trump with an even larger 5% margin of victory. \nWe won<U+2019>t have to wait long to see which national poll ends up being right. Trump supporters certainly hope the reigning king for accuracy will prevail once again. \nFor once in our lifetime, we the people have an opportunity to elect a President who was NOT chosen by Multinational Corporations, Big Banks, DC Elites, and the Globalist Lapdog Mainstream Media. \nPlease like and share if you are a TRUMP VOTER!",

The Trump show on the cable channels has pulled away viewers. Big-name NFL stars have retired or been sidelined by injuries or disciplinary actions. Colin Kaepernick <U+2019>s antics have turned off many fans, especially because his national anthem protests primarily play to a constituency that already believes football should be banned. A few quarterbacks or other players who can recapture the public<U+2019>s imagination could probably resuscitate the NFL<U+2019>s ratings all by themselves. The league could also end its sad Thursday night experiment. The deeper problem isn<U+2019>t professional football so much as the broadcast TV business model that supplies its revenues. Netflix is killing America<U+2019>s tolerance for commercials. On-demand services like Netflix, Amazon and HBO also compete with the NFL in a way that live TV never did: Their shows can be paused and the game watched only when it<U+2019>s interesting. The eternal trade-off question<U+2014> <U+201C>what do I want to do with my time?<U+201D><U+2014>is being beneficently transformed for the fan who regrets spending three-plus hours and enduring 100 commercials to watch 11 minutes of game action. Technology means liberation. A smartphone screen, it turns out, is a perfectly serviceable way to consume 90 seconds of game highlights and you don<U+2019>t go away feeling a sport you love has abused your time. Helping to fast-forward this trend is the fantasy football boom. Millions of fans care less about a particular team than about how a particular selection of players across the league are faring on a Sunday afternoon. According to the Samford University Sports Business Report, 70% of smartphone owners use the gadgets for sports consumption. No, the NFL need not panic. There will still be an audience for the full game, commercials and all. When audiences are fragmenting, programming that can pull in large audiences (even if those audiences are shrinking) can still command a rising value. If you<U+2019>re a company with a message that<U+2019>s best-suited to a 30-second commercial seen by lots of young men, the NFL is still hard to beat. For the league and its business partners, the challenge is how to exploit the new revenue opportunities technology is creating. The NFL annoyed kibitzers when it recently banned individual teams from posting video to Twitter or Facebook while a game is going on. But the league works for the team owners, not the other way around<U+2014>and team owners evidently supported a move aimed at beginning to develop a centralized (i.e., non cannibalistic) strategy for monetizing short clips. The NFL is a giant content machine, most of whose revenues are not captured by the NFL. It provides a constant flow of sports-fan soap opera that sustains dozens of businesses, including web commentators who spend their days trashing league management. One way or another, the league was destined to seek more licensing money for the video clips that keep this soap-opera world turning. A confounding variable, unfortunately, is the special problem of ESPN, owner of a $15 billion Monday Night Football contract that runs through 2021. ESPN, by a factor of five, is the most expensive part of the standard cable TV package that cord cutters increasingly find they can live without. Its golden age, don<U+2019>t say it too loudly, was financed by millions of non-fans who were forced to pay for sports programming they never watched in order to get a basic cable package. ESPN<U+2019>s current subscription leakage is running at four million households a year. Its <U+201C>SportsCenter<U+201D> franchise is being disemboweled by the timelier availability and searchability of game highlights on the web. Its parent, Disney , recently looked at buying Twitter; in August, it bought a stake in Major League Baseball<U+2019>s streaming affiliate, which also provides streaming technology for the National Hockey League and HBO. In some ways, the company is trying to make the cart pull the horse. Disney is in the early stages of flailing after a way not to be dragged down by the large sports-rights contracts that ESPN signed in the heyday of cable<U+2019>s market power. Of course, there<U+2019>s always a chance the cavalry will ride over the hill. On Friday came word that wireless giant AT&T is seriously eyeing Time Warne r, owner of HBO, CNN and TBS as well as NBA and baseball rights. If wireless operators decide they now must offer sports content in their own fierce rivalry for subscribers, a spurt of fresh billions could yet be flowing toward the NFL and its current rights owners.",

Trump may call himself a genius for his tax avoidance strategies, but in comparison, corporate America is being run by absolute virtuosos, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes . In fact, if working families could carry over deductions or spread out their taxable incomes over years like businesses, and Mr. Trump, virtually every taxpayer would be better off , according to Lily Batchelder, a law and public policy professor at New York University. Instead, Mr. Trump and the trillions of dollars that Fortune 500 companies have managed to shelter overseas serve only to highlight the need to fix the tax system. Whichever leader manages that would be considered a true genius, Mr. Sorkin argues. As for Mr. Trump, his campaign says he has a <U+201C>fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required.<U+201D> That defense remains questionable, Gretchen Morgenson writes . <U+201C>There is no such thing as a fiduciary duty as a businessman to oneself,<U+201D> says Richard W.

Bass Pro Shops is expected to receive royalties for bringing in more credit card customers as well as use of the brand.

Scrutiny Chills Small Lenders A postcrisis push for loan growth has prompted regulatory warnings about lax lending standards and made smaller banks shy away from the market. Brokers say there are fewer lenders for commercial property deals, particularly ones that involve construction or redevelopment because they are considered riskier. This means that bankers are sticking to business closer to home and finding their growth by buying up other banks instead. There were 6,122 banks in the United States in the second quarter, and at the current pace of consolidation , that figure should dip below 6,000 this quarter.

The president-elect made the announcement Wednesday morning on Twitter, telling his followers, <U+201C>I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<U+201D> Story Continued Below After cryptically posting and then deleting tweets directed at Trump earlier in the day, the OGE sent a flurry of posts praising the president-elect for his <U+201C>divestiture<U+201D> from his business holdings. But Trump did not say anything about divesting in his Tuesday morning announcement, and previously pledged only to give control of his companies to his three eldest children, not to remove his financial interests in them. <U+201C>. @ realDonaldTrump We can't repeat enough how good this total divestiture will be,<U+201D> the OGE posted to its verified Twitter account, launching the string of tweets. <U+201C>. @ realDonaldTrump Brilliant! Divestiture is good for you, very good for America!<U+201D> In some posts, the OGE seemed to mimic Trump<U+2019>s staccato style on Twitter, writing <U+201C>. @ realDonaldTrump OGE is delighted that you've decided to divest your businesses. Right decision!<U+201D> and <U+201C>. @ realDonaldTrump Bravo! Only way to resolve these conflicts of interest is to divest . Good call!<U+201D> By Louis Nelson and Darren Samuelsohn Other posts published by OGE say that the office has had contact with Trump<U+2019>s lawyers and that it had informed them that <U+201C>divestiture is the way to resolve these conflicts.<U+201D> In another post, the OGE wrote: <U+201C>[W]e told your counsel we'd sing your praises if you divested, we meant it.<U+201D> Trump<U+2019>s legal team did not immediately respond to questions about any communication it has had with the OGE. Historically, presidential candidates have pledged to put their assets into a blind trust if they were to win the White House, a threshold Trump would not meet by simply handing over control of his businesses to his children. Since his surprise victory on Election Day, the Trump children who would take control of his companies have taken on leadership roles on his transition team and have sat in on phone calls and meetings with world leaders. In a statement released after the posts went public on the OGE<U+2019>s Twitter account, a spokesman clarified that the office in fact remains unaware of the details of Trump<U+2019>s plans but nonetheless <U+201C>applauds<U+201D> his intentions. It urged him to divest from his business empire, differentiating from the Twitter posts, which suggested Trump has already made such a decision. <U+201C>Like everyone else, we were excited this morning to read the President-elect<U+2019>s twitter feed indicating that he wants to be free of conflicts of interest,<U+201D> OGE spokesman Seth Jaffe said. <U+201C>OGE applauds that goal, which is consistent with an opinion OGE issued in 1983. Divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not. We don<U+2019>t know the details of their plan, but we are willing and eager to help them with it.<U+201D> Jaffe later clarified that OGE's tweets were responding only to Trump's public comments, \"not based on any information about the President-elect<U+2019>s plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed.\" He added: \"OGE is non-partisan and does not endorse any individual.\" By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Joe Martino \n source: thesleuthjournal.com \n text: in: General Health Constipation can be incredibly painful; however, it can also take a big toll on the body. Fortunately, there is a 100% natural solution to constipation. Big pharmaceutical companies don<U+2019>t want you to know that some of the artificial medication for constipation significantly reduce the effectiveness of the intestines. As a result, some people report that without taking certain medication, they can<U+2019>t visit the toilet. The good news is, you can solve constipation quite easily. But let<U+2019>s delve deeply into what constipation can do to the body first. Bad Breath Firstly, constipation can cause bad breath (halitosis). Unfortunately, people who suffer from bad breath don<U+2019>t always realize that they have a problem. People are unlikely to point out to a person that their breath stinks; therefore, they might miss out on social events and job opportunities due to bad breath. Constipation can cause bad breath because there is a build up of toxic waste and the gasses rise up through the body. Rectal Issues & Infection As stools spend more time in the bowels, water is reabsorbed. As a result, stools get hard and dry. Some constipation suffers report that passing bowels becomes very painful and can take many hours. As a result, the rectum is stretched beyond its limits. This can lead to rectal prolapse, which is a rectum which fails to close. Rectal prolapse sufferers usually wear diapers because stool leaks out of them. Moreover, they are more prone to infection. Increase Toxins The skin is the largest organ in the body and is a reflection of a person<U+2019>s general health. Constipation typically increases the buildup of toxins in the body. As a result, the skin has to work harder to eliminate toxins. This can cause acne, skin discoloration etc. Therefore, if your skin is bad, don<U+2019>t buy an expensive beauty product. Take a look at your diet, and whether you suffer from constipation. The skin is a reflection of inner health. Colon Cancer Constipation can also cause colon cancer. The colon is designed to hold a few pounds of stools. Think of it like a plastic bag. Overload with heavy items and it rips. It<U+2019>s primary function is to transport stool. However, when an individual is constipated, it has to store stool. This puts a strain on the inner membrane and can cause ruptures and internal infections. Invasive surgery may be required in such instances. Loss Of Healthy Bacteria The intestines contain flora (healthy bacteria) which help with immunity and vitamin production. Constipation reduces the concentration of flora, thereby leaving sufferers more susceptible to infection and illness. Moreover, they help to keep stools soft. Therefore, constipation sufferers can go through a downward spiral whereby their condition worsens over time. As people age, they are more likely to get constipated. Moreover, it is more likely to have a serious effect on their health. This is because the body isn<U+2019>t as resilient. Notably, constipation can have a big effect on quality of life; especially if it comes with one of the serious conditions above. Fortunately, there is a natural cure. Sufferers no longer have to be on a path to deteriorating health. What You Can Do A majority of constipation medication are filled with chemicals which can harm the body, and make constipation worse. Even a product like Metamucil contains ingredients no person should consume, like aspartame. Change your diet! This is one of the best ways to end constipation. Eat plenty of healthy fruits and vegetables and cut out processed foods as much as you can. Eating rancid fats (cooked meat) also doesn<U+2019>t help with constipation and your digestive system so limiting that as much as possible is important. There are also some great products on the market that can assist you in ending constipation while you spend time changing your diet over time. Wholey Shit is a great example as it contains only a few natural, high quality ingredients -and it works great! You can get a free sample of Wholey Shit here. These types of remedies are a great way to get started and relief naturally and quickly while you further discover how to adjust your diet and lifestyle to reflect better digestion, eating habits and so forth.",

Peter Thiel, one of the only prominent Silicon Valley executives to back Mr. Trump, congratulated the president-elect. <U+201C>He has an awesomely difficult task, since it is long past time for us to face up to our country<U+2019>s problems,<U+201D> Mr. Thiel said in a statement. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re going to need all hands on deck.<U+201D> Several venture investors who opposed Mr. Trump moved quickly to digest lessons learned about America<U+2019>s divided electorate. <U+201C>Trump<U+2019>s victory shows that we<U+2019>ve failed much of our country on the promise of the American dream,<U+201D> said Ben Parr, a partner at DominateFund who also serves as chief marketing officer of chat-bot specialist Octane AI. <U+201C>We didn<U+2019>t understand their pain, and now the entire country will suffer because of it.<U+201D> Matt Murphy, managing director at Menlo Ventures in Menlo Park, Calif., expressed shock and viewed the results as a <U+201C>wake-up call<U+201D> for the nation about the political establishment<U+2019>s standing. But he and others talked about Mr. Trump being pro-business. Mr. Murphy also voiced a ringing vote of confidence in the power of American commerce, particularly venture-backed enterprise, to overcome social and political shocks. <U+201C>The main pillars driving innovation<U+2014>great entrepreneurs, mobile, cloud, AI<U+2014>are in place and transcend political parties,<U+201D> Mr. Murphy said. <U+201C>We are lucky to be part of a strong and resilient country with an unparalleled ability to innovate.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Gavin McInnes \n source: lewrockwell.com \n text: Taki's Magazine October 28, 2016 \nThis election is going to have unprecedented political infidelity. A good 20 percent of husbands for Trump predict their wife won<U+2019>t vote with them. This is wrong for a number of reasons but the biggie is, a family is supposed to be a cohesive unit. He can<U+2019>t have his better half canceling out his vote. Even if a husband wants to vote badly<U+2014>say, for Hillary<U+2014>his wife should stand by her man and make the same mistake. Nobody<U+2019>s saying there can<U+2019>t be discussions and women shouldn<U+2019>t have their own political beliefs, but the final decision comes down to the guy paying the bills and she should abide by that. This is counterintuitive because we live in a feminist fantasyland, but it<U+2019>s really the same as deciding where your family is going to live. A married couple agree where they<U+2019>re going to go based on what<U+2019>s best for the kids. If he gets an amazing job offer in Cleveland but she<U+2019>s a city gal from Manhattan, she needs to accept that Ohio is best for the future of their family. Voting is the same. You<U+2019>re deciding where the country is going to go based on what<U+2019>s best for future generations. \nUnfortunately, this is not happening. A map of America <U+201C>if just men voted<U+201D> is almost completely red, whereas a map of America <U+201C>if just women voted<U+201D> is almost completely blue. The maps don<U+2019>t differentiate between married and single, but judging by this massive split in what gender likes what candidate, we can assume the married map would be similar. Single people are a lost cause anyway. The women vote almost exclusively out of spite. They are voting for Hillary because she has a pussy, they hate Trump because he grabbed one, and they elected Obama because he makes theirs wet (they elected Trudeau because he is one). As for single men, I<U+2019>m not convinced they even vote . There are also stay-at-home dads and situations where the woman is the breadwinner. This is awkward, but if you<U+2019>ve made her the patriarch then her husband (a.k.a. wife) needs to vote with her. For the most part, however, we<U+2019>re talking about a home where the father makes the lion<U+2019>s share of the money and the woman<U+2019>s contribution is using her magic powers to make babies. They have a symbiotic relationship where they<U+2019>re both utilizing their greatest strengths. Patriarchs are best at driving, so he<U+2019>s the helmsman. He doesn<U+2019>t want to fight about it because he doesn<U+2019>t want to rock the boat, but for her to turn starboard while he<U+2019>s going port is to split everything in half and now the whole family is drowning. Voting against your husband is a tiny divorce.

Lee \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/leading-contender-for-donald-trump-s-chief-of-staff-is-rnc-chairman-reince-priebus-1479069597 \n text: President-elect Donald Trump named Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff, a selection that suggests the Republican is interested in a more conventional approach to governing after his insurgent campaign. Mr. Trump on Sunday also named Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist and senior counsel. Mr. Bannon, who was chief executive of the Trump campaign, was in consideration with Mr. Priebus for the White House<U+2019>s top personnel position. <U+201C>Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said in a statement. <U+201C>Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.<U+201D> Capital Journal is WSJ.com<U+2019>s home for Trump Transition news. The selection of Mr. Priebus as staff chief is an important marker in Mr. Trump<U+2019>s high-pressure race against the clock to build the next administration . That effort begins in earnest on Monday, as his broader transition team holds its first formal meetings since a shake-up on Friday that installed Vice President-elect Mike Pence atop the organization. Still, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s transition is slightly behind the pace set by previous incoming presidents and the timetable established by his own team. President Barack Obama, for example, named his chief of staff two days after winning the 2008 campaign. Inside the Trump transition team, a broader group of officials known as the <U+201C>landing team<U+201D> was supposed to have been announced on Friday and start inspecting agencies for potential changes this coming week. That was delayed after Mr. Trump shuffled the transition team<U+2019>s leadership. Another contributing factor: Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory surprised even his own top advisers, who, before Tuesday, were unable to focus the New York businessman on the 73 days between the election and inauguration, a senior aide said. They said Mr. Trump didn<U+2019>t want to jinx himself by planning the transition before he had actually won. During their private White House meeting on Thursday, Mr. Obama walked his successor through the duties of running the country , and Mr. Trump seemed surprised by the scope, said people familiar with the meeting. Trump aides were described by those people as unaware that the entire presidential staff working in the West Wing had to be replaced at the end of Mr. Obama<U+2019>s term. After meeting with Mr. Trump, the only person to be elected president without having held a government or military position, Mr. Obama realized the Republican needs more guidance. He plans to spend more time with his successor than presidents typically do, people familiar with the matter said. Jason Miller, communications director for the Trump transition, declined to comment on those characterizations of the White House visit. He said in a statement that, <U+201C>The difference between President-elect Trump and a politician is that Trump puts a premium on making the right decision, not the politically expedient one. President-elect Trump<U+2019>s excellent judgment and temperament has served him well in business and in life, and he<U+2019>s not going to be swayed by a bunch of political insiders responsible for filling up the swamp in the first place.<U+201D> There are signs that Mr. Trump has tempered several of his top campaign promises . He vowed during the campaign to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but he said in a <U+201C>60 Minutes<U+201D> interview broadcast Sunday that a fence could be sufficient in some parts. He also told CBS that he is rethinking his call to have a prosecutor investigate Hillary Clinton , saying of the Clintons that <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t want to hurt them<U+201D> and <U+201C>they<U+2019>re good people.<U+201D> Still, he said in the interview that he would aim to jail or deport between two million and three million illegal immigrants whom he described as criminals, gang members and drug dealers. He didn<U+2019>t specify how he would do this. The Obama administration already has made deporting illegal immigrants with criminal records a priority. The selection of Mr. Priebus will, by definition, help organize the transition. This decision allows Mr. Trump and his team to focus on identifying 15 cabinet positions and more than 1,000 top posts that must be confirmed by the Senate. Born: Education: Political career: Personal background: Trump ties: A trained attorney, Mr. Priebus first interacted with the Trump inner circle in September 2015 when he persuaded the political neophyte to sign a pledge to support the GOP nominee, even if he lost the primary. He was among a small group inside a glass-encased Trump Tower conference room with Mr. Trump when they were informed the Washington Post was preparing to publish an 11-year-old video in which the nominee made lewd comments about forcing himself on women . As the rest of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s team strategized the response, Mr. Priebus was largely sidelined by an avalanche of calls and emails from top Republicans urging him to pull the party<U+2019>s funding from the Trump campaign. While Mr. Priebus<U+2019>s elevation is a nod to the Washington establishment, Mr. Bannon brings a more disruptive political force into the White House. The former Goldman Sachs banker became chairman of the Trump campaign in late summer, leaving his position atop Breitbart News. That website has taken aim at establishment GOP figures and is identified with the <U+201C>alt right,<U+201D> a movement that promotes nativism and views immigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity. After he joined the campaign, Mr. Bannon pushed Mr. Trump to focus on white working-class voters and was instrumental in assembling a surprise news conference just hours before a presidential debate that featured Mr. Trump and several women who had accused his rival<U+2019>s husband , former President Bill Clinton, of sexual misconduct. At the news conference, Mr. Bannon, wearing glasses and pushing his hands into his jacket pockets, flashed a mischievous smile as stunned reporters<U+2014>who had been told they would be witnessing debate preparations<U+2014>surveyed the room. <U+201C>Bannon is going to be keeper of the image of Trump as a fighter against the status quo, and Reince is going to utilize his personal connections with the speaker and others, to make the trains run on time,<U+201D> said Ken Blackwell, a former Ohio state official and a member of the transition team. While other former campaign officials met in New York on Sunday, the broader transition staff based in Washington gathers on Monday. They will discuss the so-called landing teams tasked with entering federal agencies and reporting back on potential changes. Friday<U+2019>s reorganization of the transition team increased the influence of Mr. Pence and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.), who now has several allies holding top staff positions. The role for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had been in charge of the transition, has been diluted. The slower decision-making process is also amplified by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s lack of public appearances since the election, even as protests erupt around the country following his election. While Mr. Obama and his predecessor, Republican George W. Bush in 2000, used constant news conferences after their victories to speak to Americans, Mr. Trump has held none, only doing a Wall Street Journal interview and the <U+201C>60 Minutes<U+201D> appearance. On Sunday, Mr. Trump noted that he had received congratulatory calls from Republicans who were opposed to his candidacy. Mr. Trump said primary rival Jeb Bush and his father and brother, the two most recent Republican presidents, all called <U+201C>to express their best wishes.<U+201D> Mitt Romney, the party<U+2019>s 2012 nominee, also called to offer his congratulations. <U+2014>Damian Paletta contributed to this article.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Collective Evolution \n source: collective-evolution.com \n text: \nThis is one out of several cases raising concerns about the health consequences of using regular talcum powder use. Approximately 1,000 more cases have been filed in Missouri state court, and another 200 in New Jersey, but this may well be the tip of the iceberg. \nAs Global News reports: <U+201C>The jury ruling ended the trial that began Sept. 26 in the case brought by Deborah Giannecchini of Modesto, California. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012. The suit accused Johnson & Johnson of <U+201C>negligent conduct<U+201D> in making and marketing its baby powder.<U+201D> \nUnfortunately, a statement from Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman with Johnson & Johnson, said in the statement to Global: <U+201C>We deeply sympathize with the woman and families impacted by ovarian cancer<U+2026>We will appeal today<U+2019>s verdict because we are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson<U+2019>s Baby Powder.<U+201D>   Obviously, if these are the decisions being made by a court of law, there is ample amounts of science and evidence suggesting the baby powder was indeed the cause. Earlier in the year, a decision was made last by a Missouri state jury that awarded the family of Jacqueline Fox $10-million of actual damages and $62 million of punitive damages. In this case, we saw the exact same response from the company as the case noted above. These cases show how people are using something they thought was perfectly safe, but clearly wasn<U+2019>t. One of the most painful revelations, as Bloomberg notes, is that: In the 1990s, even as the company acknowledged concerns in the health community, it considered increasing its marketing efforts to black and Hispanic women, who were already buying the product in high numbers. Fox was black. The jury foreman, Krista Smith, says internal documents provided the most incriminating evidence: <U+2018>It was really clear they were hiding something.<U+2019> She wanted to award the Fox family even more. Imerys Talc America, the biggest talc supplier in the country and the sole source of the powder for J&J, was also named as a defendant. The company wasn<U+2019>t found liable. The <U+2018>scientific evidence<U+2019> to which she refers clearly have not withstood the scrutiny of either this trial or concerned members of the public; it also fails to account for who funded the research. Her remark also makes plain a disturbing trend amongst big corporations, which is the blind trust of their employees. Many clearly believe what they are told about the products they represent, without questioning or doing their own independent research. Scientific fraud induced by major corporations in this field is no secret, and various medical experts around the world have been speaking out against it for decades. Dr. Richard Horton, current Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet , one of the largest medical journals in the world, has publicly and unequivocally called out the scientific community for this negligence and outright fraud: The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. ( source ) The sheer volume of statements from very credible people, along with the documents and evidence, attesting to this disturbing trend, is simply overwhelming. (You can find more information and view more examples/statements in an article we recently published about anti-depressant drugs here .) Yet the unfortunate reality is that employees of these big corporations stand behind their products, working under the assurances of corporately-funded science which, obviously, has profit in mind rather than safety. This is a widespread and alarming problem, and it<U+2019>s great to see more people raise their voice against these shady practices. Dr. Marcia Angell, a physician and longtime Editor-in-Chief of the New England Medical Journal (NEMJ), is another such professional to do so: It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine. ( source ) It<U+2019>s no secret that many household products are toxic to our health. Science has been confirming their dangers for years now (not that many of us needed this confirmation); these products are literally littered with a number of hazardous harmful chemicals. Researchers in the UK, for example, found that domestic products such as anti-insect sprays, deodorants, cleaning products, cosmetics, and more contain a number of cancer causing chemicals. The researchers, from the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, who concluded that these types of everyday household products maybe be contributing to 100,000 deaths every single year in Europe, warn that the public remains unaware of these risks. Another example of an insider speaking out against the industry is Foster Gamble, the direct descendant of one of the founders of Procter & Gamble (a company similar to Johnson & Johnson). He himself explains that he was groomed for the establishment, but his ethical concerns prompted him to change direction. To the left you will see a picture of him with Gerald Ford. Foster decided to leave the business and instead raise awareness about many issues, including the hazards associated with everyday household products that the corporations like his father<U+2019>s manufacture. He<U+2019>s had an interesting life to say the least, and you can watch a documentary he released a few years ago here . \nThe Sacred Science follows eight people from around the world, with varying physical and psychological illnesses, as they embark on a one-month healing journey into the heart of the Amazon jungle. \nYou can watch this documentary film FREE for 10 days by clicking here. \n\"If <U+201C>Survivor<U+201D> was actually real and had stakes worth caring about, it would be what happens here, and <U+201C>The Sacred Science<U+201D> hopefully is merely one in a long line of exciting endeavors from this group.\" - Billy Okeefe, McClatchy Tribune",

Sixty-seven percent of Hispanic likely voters who responded to the nationwide poll said they support Clinton, while just 19 percent favor Trump. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, polled at 4 percent, while the Green Party<U+2019>s Jill Stein came in at 2 percent. Story Continued Below Trump has struggled to connect with Latino voters from Day One of his presidential campaign, labeling undocumented Mexican immigrants as rapists, drug dealers and criminals at his Trump Tower launch event. The Republican nominee has pledged to build a wall along America<U+2019>s southern border with Mexico and to deport all undocumented immigrants. Neither proposal has endeared him to the Hispanic community. Just 20 percent of respondents said they held either a very favorable or somewhat favorable view of Trump, compared with 69 percent who said the same of Clinton, the Democratic nominee. Twenty-eight percent said they view Clinton very or somewhat unfavorably, while 76 percent hold those views of Trump. Seventy-three percent of respondents said they believe Trump is racist. The Manhattan billionaire has, at times throughout his campaign, sought to mend fences with the Hispanic community by toning down his immigration rhetoric and traveling to Mexico City to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto. But those instances of toning-down have rarely lasted, with Trump generally quick to return to the hard-line immigration stance that played a large part in his success in the Republican primary. Among the respondents to the Washington Post/Univision poll, 15 percent identified immigration as the most important issue they will consider in deciding their vote. Only <U+201C>jobs and the economy<U+201D> was listed as more important, with 28 percent selecting it as the issue that will most help them decide who to vote for. The Washington Post/Univision poll was conducted from Oct. 26-30, interviewing 1,008 Hispanic likely voters on landlines and cellphones in English and in Spanish.

Trump and giving the Republican Party its first victory in a presidential race here since 1988. In Macomb County, just north of Detroit, where the term <U+201C>Reagan Democrats<U+201D> was coined after white autoworkers abandoned the party for Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, Mr. Trump captured 53.6 percent of the vote, compared with 47.6 percent statewide, according to preliminary results. Many of his supporters here were blue-collar Obama voters who saw modern-day Republicans as out of touch with their interests until Mr. Trump, with his brash outsider message, came along. Chris Vitale, a longtime Chrysler employee and United Auto Workers member, supported Barack Obama twice, as did his union and his county. But on Tuesday, Mr. Vitale rejected the U.A.W.<U+2019>s choice, Hillary Clinton, and voted with gusto for Mr. Trump. <U+201C>The Republicans that generally get run are anti-manufacturing, anti-Midwest,<U+201D> said Mr. Vitale, 44, of St. Clair Shores, explaining why he rejected Mitt Romney in 2012 and Senator John McCain in 2008. <U+201C>Mr. Trump understood our problems right off the bat, without being told by anyone.<U+201D> Macomb County<U+2019>s autoworkers were hardly alone in gravitating toward Mr. Trump. Patricia Meadows, a retired waitress, voted for Mr. Obama in 2012 because she liked him, she said, and was hopeful about his health care law . But this time around, Ms. Meadows had no use for Mrs. Clinton or any candidate who had spent time in the nation<U+2019>s capital. Mr. Trump was the lesser of two evils because he was <U+201C>not so political,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>I think everybody in Washington needs a kick in the rear,<U+201D> Ms. Meadows, 68, said on Thursday as she ate fried fish at a diner in Warren, a weathered city at the county<U+2019>s southern end. <U+201C>And I think Washington needs to be done with the Clintons.<U+201D> She added, however, that she hoped Mr. Trump would not <U+201C>do away with the health care<U+201D> <U+2014> Mr. Obama<U+2019>s Affordable Care Act <U+2014> as he had promised on the campaign trail. Her daughter had obtained subsidized insurance coverage through the law for $50 a month. <U+201C>I think he was bluffing,<U+201D> Ms. Meadows said with a frown. Mayor James R. Fouts of Warren said Trump supporters here were especially motivated by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s promise to overturn or overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement, which they blame for the loss of American manufacturing jobs to Mexico. All year, Mr. Trump has attacked Ford Motor Company in particular for planning to move all of its small car production to Mexico. Noting that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont also criticized free trade agreements when he ran against Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primary race, Mr. Fouts said that some who normally vote Democrat in Macomb County had initially supported Mr. Sanders and migrated to Mr. Trump only after Mrs. Clinton became the Democratic nominee. <U+201C>There were a significant number of Sanders people who made the transition to Trump,<U+201D> said Mr. Fouts, whose office is nonpartisan. <U+201C>Bernie might have won here; Joe Biden might have won. But Hillary was never going to be the candidate to convince people around here that she was going to make a difference in their lives.<U+201D> Mr. Fouts voted for Mr. Obama twice. But this time he rejected both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump for a third-party candidate <U+2014> which one, he would not say. The last time the county backed a Republican presidential candidate was in 2004. Mr. Trump may also have energized a segment of Macomb County voters who had not bothered to participate in the 2012 election. Voter turnout in the county was 4 percent higher this year, according to preliminary results, with 67 percent of registered voters casting ballots. On the other hand, some of the state<U+2019>s most heavily Democratic counties, including Wayne, home to Detroit, and Genesee, home to Flint, saw less turnout than four years ago. Amanda Rogers, a bartender in Warren, sat out the 2012 election but hustled to the polls to vote for Mr. Trump. Her boyfriend and her brother voted for the first time in their lives, she said. Ms. Rogers, 34, was motivated in part by what she saw as Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s lenient stance on immigration. <U+201C>We are drowning right now,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>Our vets are homeless. There<U+2019>s one out of every five American children starving right now. And Clinton wants to open the floodgates and let everybody else in.<U+201D> Ms. Rogers, who said she had <U+201C>loved Bill Clinton as a president<U+201D> and found Mr. Obama <U+201C>all right,<U+201D> added: <U+201C>There<U+2019>s people who<U+2019>ve been here 12 years who don<U+2019>t even care to learn the language but want to reap all the benefits of this country: food stamps, free health care, Section 8 housing, welfare checks. People are sick of that, especially in Macomb County.<U+201D> Muslims from places like Yemen and Bangladesh are the most visible immigrants here. Just south of Macomb County is Hamtramck, which in one generation went from overwhelmingly Polish Catholic to majority Muslim. In Macomb, the City of Sterling Heights, home to a large Ford plant, is facing a federal lawsuit after rejecting a proposed mosque last year. Mr. Trump held a rally last Sunday in Sterling Heights, where he elicited boos against Mrs. Clinton when he said she wanted <U+201C>virtually unlimited immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world,<U+201D> and would <U+201C>import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and your communities.<U+201D> Macomb County, though still largely white, is becoming more diverse: 82.3 percent of its 865,000 residents were white in 2015, according to the Census Bureau, down from 85.4 percent in 2010. The black population grew to 11.4 percent, from 8.6 percent. About 10 percent of the population is foreign born. Many here also complain that poverty and crime are growing. As Macomb helped assure Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory on Election Day, it also played a major role in the defeat of a local ballot initiative that would have taxed its residents, and those of four neighboring counties, to build a public transportation system connecting Detroit and its suburbs. Jason Powrozek, 18, a high school senior from New Baltimore, on the more affluent north side of the county, said he had voted against the transportation measure because <U+201C>I just felt it would speed up the transport of drugs up here from the inner city.<U+201D> A first-time voter, he had volunteered for at the county Republican headquarters and went to New York for the Trump campaign<U+2019>s election night party. <U+201C>He tells it like it is,<U+201D> Jason said of Mr. Trump. <U+201C>He speaks what people don<U+2019>t want to say because it<U+2019>s politically incorrect.<U+201D> Mr. Trump also spoke on Halloween at Macomb Community College. Frank Pitcher, 49, who lives in Sterling Heights and has worked at its Ford plant for 23 years, went to the Trump rally there and said he was surprised at how many of his co-workers he saw. <U+201C>I took some pictures with people there and posted on my Facebook because I wasn<U+2019>t going to hide how I was voting,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m not ashamed of where I stand.<U+201D> Brittany Greeson contributed reporting.

In August, a federal judge ordered John Bentel <U+2014> former director of the Information Resources Management staff in Secretary of State Clinton's office <U+2014> to submit to a sworn deposition in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch. Story Continued Below When ordering the questioning of Bentel, U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan noted that Bentel told the House Benghazi Committee last year that he had no recollection of being told about Clinton's private server, but emails that have become public in the past year or so showed he was informed about issues related to the server. \"The Court is persuaded that Mr. Bentel should be deposed because the record in this case appears to contradict his sworn testimony before the Benghazi Committee,\" Sullivan wrote. The judge said the IT official might have information about the purpose for setting up the server and whether it was intended to flout FOIA requests. However, the deposition proved to shed little light on the issue since Bentel repeatedly invoked his rights against self-incrimination when he was questioned Monday. <U+201C>The fact that yet another State Department official took the Fifth highlights the disturbing implication that criminal acts took place related to the Clinton email and our Freedom of Information Act requests,<U+201D> Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement. Lawyers for Bentel, Kyle Clark and Jamie Lynn, did not respond to an email seeking comment on the deposition. In addition to testifying before the House Benghazi panel last year, Bentel spoke with the FBI in June, repeating his claim that he was unaware of the Clinton server, while acknowledging he knew she had a personal email account. According to congressional sources, he spoke after receiving a grant of immunity from prosecutors. \"BENTEL did not learn that HILLARY CLINTON was using a private email server while she was at DOS until it came out in the press last year,\" the FBI wrote in a report summarizing the interview. The report, released recently by the FBI, says Bentel was shown emails mentioning Clinton's server and he said he did not remember them. Two of Bentel's subordinates told the State Department inspector general that they went to him with concerns about Clinton's use of a private email system and were told by Bentel to drop the matter since State lawyers had signed off on the arrangement. He told the FBI he recalled no such discussions. By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

According to Fish<U+2019>s email, these Fastwalkers came from unknown locations in distant space :\nOne of these times, a member of that group was really excited <U+2013> said they<U+2019>d just picked up Fastwalker (I assumed that same day). He described how it entered our atmosphere from <U+201C>deep space<U+201D> (origin actually unknown, of course, but from the backside of the satellite) and zipped by the DSP satellite pretty closely on its way to earth.\nFish<U+2019>s email is pure hearsay, no doubt, but Fish seems to recognize that such anecdotal evidence, blurred photographs, and crop circles will never win over the minds of the general public. In another email dated March 5, 2015, Fish wrote Podesta again, this time to stress the need for hard scientific proof of extraterrestrial intelligence :\nWhat needs to be collected and publicly disseminated is hard scientific data collected from instruments that are known to be accurate and reliable. Within the US, this information has existed for many years and is still available today, if one knows <U+201C>where to look<U+201D> and <U+201C>what to look for.\nSome of these emails were forwarded to Leslie Kean, an investigative journalist and noted UFO researcher who co-founded the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFi), an <U+201C>independent alliance advocating for greater government openness on information about UFOs.<U+201D> Kean has been known to accuse the government of UFO coverups in the past, so her presence in these email chains adds some credibility to the theories that the Obama administration might be close to announcing the government<U+2019>s knowledge of UFOs .

Dyer reports a so-called Christian humanist said one of the most ignorant and dangerous things that has probably ever been said regarding radical Islam and Christianity <U+2014> that fundamentalist Christianity is more dangerous than radical Islam. \nThe Chicago Maroon reported : \nA leading humanist scholar stressed symbolic Bible reading and warned of the radical right at a talk on Tuesday at the Seminary Co-Op. \nFor Catherine M. Wallace, faculty member at Northwestern<U+2019>s Feinberg School of Medicine and author of the recently concluded book series Christian Humanism and the Moral Imagination , the Christian fundamentalist movement in the United States is more dangerous than Islamic terrorism. Wallace, a Christian herself, believes fundamentalist access to United States armaments is the number one threat to state security. \nWallace said, <U+201C>If [anything Islamic] wanted to attack an American city, they had to hijack an airliner. If they want to blow up a concert, they need to put bombs on their own children and send young men in to kill themselves<U+2026> that kind of radicalism [Christian fundamentalism] in control of nuclear codes was a much, much greater threat.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>The religious right in its most contemporary form has an origin in Southern opposition to desegregation and to the Civil Rights Movement<U+2026> a transparently racist appeal,<U+201D> her ignorant interpretation of the <U+201C>religious right<U+201D> continued. \nWallace claimed that the literal interpretation of the Bible is problematic and that <U+201C>nobody in the ancient world would have read the Bible literally.<U+201D> She added that, <U+201C>Christian fundamentalism is a malignant form of Christianity.<U+201D> \nThis is what passes for a scholar in America.

Radical Islam is coming to America and is already here. There are radicalized mosques in this country that we can<U+2019>t properly monitor because of political correctness. \nHey, maybe Wallace should have her next conversation at one of the radicalized mosques in this country and see how that goes over.

Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s running mate, is hosting a pair of receptions in California this week with top fundraisers to the Democratic nominee<U+2019>s campaign to thank them for their contributions. <U+201C>Hillary and Tim are grateful for your support of their campaign and he looks forward to thanking you in person on December 2nd,<U+201D> reads the invitation to Friday<U+2019>s San Francisco event, which will be held at the home of former Ambassador Eleni Kounalakis. Story Continued Below Kaine will also headline a Los Angeles event during his California swing. It's not unusual for a campaign to thank its top donors, but the events represent the first organized in-person outreach to donors from a member of the Clinton-Kaine ticket since they lost the White House to Donald Trump and Mike Pence earlier this month. Clinton did join a conference call with top fundraisers just days after the election, pinning much of the blame f or her loss on FBI Director Jim Comey<U+2019>s letters. But it's Kaine who still has a political future. The invitations come from a former member of Clinton<U+2019>s finance staff, though donors are asked to RSVP to a member of Kaine<U+2019>s political team. The senator was a top fundraising draw for Clinton<U+2019>s campaign in the closing months of her presidential bid, and many Democrats have long assumed he would eventually run for the White House himself.

It has been six weeks since the Democratic ticket last stumped side-by-side and since then the likelihood that they will occupy the White House next January has only grown, and those around them have quietly begun contemplating Kaine<U+2019>s portfolio and role in 2017. Story Continued Below <U+201C>You<U+2019>re up in the polls you<U+2019>re starting to feel like, <U+2018>We might be working together for four years.<U+2019> And you don<U+2019>t want to think it. But it<U+2019>s in the back of the mind,<U+201D> said Mark Begich, who served with Kaine in the Senate for two years and has since stayed in touch. <U+201C>He has to figure out where he can complement her and add value to what<U+2019>s she<U+2019>s working on.<U+201D> Saturday will mark only the third time that Clinton and Kaine have campaigned together since the Democratic convention, and they don<U+2019>t have a years-long friendship predating 2016 to lean on. In 2008, he was one of the earliest prominent endorsers of then-Sen. Barack Obama. He led the Democratic Party while she was secretary of state and avoiding partisan fights. And he didn<U+2019>t join the Senate until 2013, just as she was departing her post. So, from the start, Clinton<U+2019>s headquarters worked to integrate Kaine and his team into their existing infrastructure rather than running parallel campaigns. Kaine<U+2019>s top aide, Mike Henry, still travels with the senator, but he is joined by Matt Paul, a top Clinton confidant who served as her Iowa state director, and Karen Finney, who had previously worked on Clinton<U+2019>s communications team out of New York. Kaine<U+2019>s other top adviser to join the campaign, Amy Dudley, a former staffer for Joe Biden, is based out of Brooklyn, giving Kaine a line inside headquarters. 2016 By Andrew Restuccia , Sarah Wheaton and Nancy Cook Kaine has already endeared himself to Brooklyn for his willingness to be a team player. As a former lieutenant governor in Virginia, Kaine has the uncommon experience of having already serving as the No. 2 in an executive branch (though the governor and lieutenant governor are elected independently in Virginia.) <U+201C>She<U+2019>s the boss,<U+201D> as Kaine told People magazine in joint interview with Clinton this summer. At the vice-presidential debate, Kaine won praise from Clinton<U+2019>s team for his relentless push to keep the focus on Trump, even to the point where his constant, badgering interruptions got him mocked on Saturday Night Live . <U+201C>I needed to make sure that he did not open up any new line of attack on Hillary,<U+201D> Kaine said on The View last week about his debate. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m defending my running mate. And the nice thing was the next day there was no stories about Hillary or anything about Hillary.<U+201D> But there have been scant outward signs of any genuine closeness between Clinton and Kaine. After she came down with pneumonia, Kaine said he hadn<U+2019>t heard of the diagnosis before she fell faint on camera and that he hadn<U+2019>t spoken to her in the week since their joint appearance on Labor Day. On the day of Kaine<U+2019>s only debate, Clinton said she hadn<U+2019>t spoken to him <U+2014> <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t want to interrupt his rhythm by calling<U+201D> <U+2014> and even afterward she at first only emailed , not calling until the next day . By Helena Bottemiller Evich , Catherine Boudreau , Ian Kullgren and Jenny Hopkinson Kaine himself has said he has consulted with Biden about the role of vice president, and that he envisions himself as a counselor for Clinton at the most crucial moments. <U+201C>The best job you do as VP is just try to be with the president when every hard decision is made,<U+201D> Kaine said on The View . More specifically, he cited his interest, as a former mayor, in working with local governments and using his Spanish-speaking skills to act as a link with the Latino community. It<U+2019>s the latter that has some on Clinton<U+2019>s team particularly excited. Kaine recently made history by delivering an entire campaign speech in Spanish. <U+201C>I have a real passion for Latin America,<U+201D> Kaine said on The View , as campaign insiders have speculated that Kaine could take the lead on South and Central American matters in a potential Clinton administration. In the Senate, Kaine has served on both the Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees and as a young man he served as a missionary in Honduras. 2016 By Katie Glueck and Kyle Cheney As Clinton crafts her legislative agenda, she is also expected to lean on Kaine<U+2019>s relationships across in the Senate, both from his committee work as well as from co-chairing a weekly bipartisan Senate prayer breakfast. Prior to his selection, Clinton and Kaine sat for two lengthy meetings, the second of which was a lunch in Chappaqua with their families, including Kaine<U+2019>s wife, Anne Holton, who was serving as Virginia<U+2019>s secretary of education until Kaine joined the ticket.

McCaskill Seung Min Kim Burgess Everett Michael Grunwald \n source: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/cruz-supreme-court-blockade-230363 \n text: Ted Cruz said on Wednesday that there is precedent to limiting the Supreme Court to just eight justices. | AP Photo By Burgess Everett 10/26/16 08:15 PM EDT Updated 10/26/16 08:49 PM EDT In a vintage return to his confrontational style, Sen. Ted Cruz indicated that Republicans could seek to block a Democratic president from filling the vacant Supreme Court seat indefinitely. After staking his endorsement of Donald Trump on a list of potential conservative Supreme Court nominees, Cruz said on Wednesday that there is precedent to limiting the Supreme Court to just eight justices. Last week, Cruz's colleague, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), suggested the GOP should confirm President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, to avoid having to swallow a more liberal nominee under Hillary Clinton. Story Continued Below As is his nature, Cruz took a harder line when asked how Republicans would handle a potential Clinton nominee while campaigning in Colorado for Darryl Glenn, a longshot candidate for the Senate. By Nolan D. McCaskill <U+201C>There will be plenty of time for debate on that issue ... There is certainly long historical precedent for a Supreme Court with fewer justices. I would note, just recently, that Justice [Stephen] Breyer observed that the vacancy is not impacting the ability of the court to do its job. That<U+2019>s a debate that we are going to have,\" Cruz said, in remarks first reported by The Washington Post. Cruz was unlikely to vote for any Democratic nominee given his conservative ideology, but his remarks could indicate a broader shift within the GOP to halt Democrats from shifting the court's balance to the left. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said earlier this month the GOP would be \"united\" in blocking a Clinton appointment, remarks he later softened. An indefinite GOP blockade of a Supreme Court nominee would almost certainly lead to an erosion in the Senate's supermajority requirement. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has already suggested lowering the bar for Supreme Court nominee from 60 votes to a simple majority. Under Reid, Democrats changed the Senate rules to allow all nominees but Supreme Court appointments to be approved by a majority vote. By Seung Min Kim and Burgess Everett \"We need to treat it like the constitutional crisis it will be if Democrats don't take back the Senate majority,\" Reid said on Wednesday night in an email to members of the liberal Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \"The Supreme Court could dwindle to 7, then maybe 6, Justices. It would turn our Justice system and our democracy on its head. The Founding Fathers would roll over in their graves.\" Republicans have blocked from even holding hearings on the Garland nomination for more than seven months, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said the Senate will not confirm Garland in the post-election lame duck. In his last availablity on Capitol Hill before the election, McConnell refused to entertain the possibility that the Senate may be forced to entertain a more liberal judge next year, though there may be enough centrist Republicans and those deferential to presidential prerogative to confirm a justice like Garland. Later Wednesday, Justice Clarence Thomas lamented that the broken confirmation process was a sign of larger problems. Speaking to The Heritage Foundation to mark 25 years on the Supreme Court, Thomas did not cite the Garland blockade but noted a decline in civil behavior. \"We have decided,\" he said according to The Associated Press, \"that rather than confront disagreements, we'll just simply annihilate the person who disagrees with me. I don't think that's going to work in a republic, in a civil society.\" By Michael Grunwald By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz",

The complaint is the result of correspondence unearthed as part of hacked and leaked emails from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta. Pritchard had emailed Podesta about an op-ed from Clinton in July 2015 , specifically saying <U+201C>It would be good to get it in on Tuesday, when she is in New Hampshire. That would give her big presence on Tuesday with the piece and on Wednesday with the news story.<U+201D> Story Continued Below In his letter to the FEC, Aylward says Pritchard<U+2019>s emails are <U+201C>proof of the illegal scheme that resulted in substantial in-kind corporate contributions made by the Boston Globe on behalf of the Clinton campaign.<U+201D> <U+201C>Clearly, Ms. Pritchard, in her communications with Mr. Podesta, was not acting as a journalist operating within the protected boundaries of the FEC<U+2019>s well established press exemption,\" Aylward wrote. \"Instead, Ms. Pritchard was using the Globe, a corporate entity, illegally to serve as a covert advocate and a behind-the-scenes helper for Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s presidential campaign.\" As a result of this apparent <U+201C>collusion,<U+201D> Aylward wrote, <U+201C>The Boston Globe deserves to be severely sanctioned for its violations of our campaign finance laws.<U+201D> Aylward is an anti-tax activist and businessman based in Watertown and an unsuccessful candidate for the state Senate in 2012. He is currently challenging the Massachusetts Republican Party chair Kirsten Hughes. Ellen Clegg , the Globe's editorial page editor, said that both campaigns had been asked to write op-ed pieces for the paper. \"Steve Aylward<U+2019>s claim simply has no basis in fact,<U+201D> Clegg said in a statement to POLITICO Massachusetts. \"Newspapers do not violate campaign finance laws by asking candidates to write opinion pieces. The Globe asked both the Trump and the Clinton campaigns if their candidates would write op ed pieces to be published in the Globe. That is not against the law, and unless the First Amendment is repealed, it never will be.\" After the Wikileaks release of the emails in October, Pritchard defended the correspondence on Twitter: <U+201C>Re: @wikileaks: Opinion is separate from newsroom. My goal: to persuade writers that Globe is best forum for their ideas. It's what we do.<U+201D> Aylward cited guidance from the FEC in 2013 regarding an email to subscribers to a Sean Hannity email list from Clear Channel radio host Mark Levin specifically advocating for congressional candidate John Gomez, encouraging readers to donate to Gomez<U+2019>s campaign, and including a link to the campaign<U+2019>s website. The FEC ruled the correspondence was outside <U+201C>legitimate press function<U+201D> and therefore counted as an <U+201C>email solicitation<U+201D> for the Gomez campaign. A spokesperson for the FEC could not confirm receipt of the complaint, which was filed on Friday, according to Aylward. According to FEC protocol , should the complaint meet basic requirements, it will be referred to the Office of Complaints Examination and Legal Administration, where findings of the investigation will remain confidential until resolved. Alt-right news outlets including Breitbart have jumped on the correspondence, calling it an example of <U+201C>media canoodling<U+201D> with Clinton.

Trump fills out his administration. At the same time, Washington insiders attempt to capture Trump and influence his positions, policies and decisions. The presidency is an institution, not a man, not a president. The presidency is a network of enormous power with Trump now at its center. Washington insiders who live and breathe politics are now in a race for positions of power and influence. They hanker and vie for appointments. Trump must make appointments. He cannot operate alone. He must delegate power to make decisions. He cannot monitor all information pertinent to every issue in which the government has a hand. The presidency is not 100 percent centralized. Decision-making power is allocated to levels below the president himself and to levels surrounding him. It also lies outside the presidency in Congress. Trump has his ideas and desires for actions, but their realization depends on the people he appoints. He loses control and locks himself in with every appointment that he makes. People around him want his power and want to influence him. They have a heavy influence on what he hears, whom he sees, the options presented to him, and the evaluations of competing personnel. Trump will likely form a very small team of offshoots of himself, people whom he trusts implicitly, in order to extend his capacity to choose people who will adhere to and execute his agenda.Power in Washington is not simply the apparatus of administering the presidency that will take up headlines for the next few months. After the U.S. Treasury robs the tax-paying Americans, new robbers (the Lobby) appear to rob the Treasury using every device they can get away with. There is a second contingent, the power-seekers. Those who covet the exercise of power unceasingly work toward their own narrow aims. As long as Washington remains the place that concentrates unbelievably large amounts of money and powers, it will remain the swamp that Trump has promised to drain but won<U+2019>t. He cannot drain it, not without destroying Washington<U+2019>s power and he cannot accomplish that, nor does he even hint that he wants to accomplish that. His stated aims are the redirection of money and powers, not their elimination for the sake of a greater justice, a greater right, and a truly greater people and country.The presidency is an establishment and Washington is another. By being elected, Trump struck a blow at the members of the establishment who will be packing their bags while weeping over their losses (see here and here .) But elections do not strike the roots of the presidency, the establishment or Washington. Neither will demonstrations against Trump. The Obama establishment is dead. The Democratic establishment is dead, at least for 4 years. There was a time, a very brief time under the Articles of Confederation, when Americans recognized the evils of the establishment and avoided instituting one. This gave way almost immediately (in 1787) to the constitutional seed that planted the enormous tree that now cuts out the sun of justice from American lives. A domestic war failed to uproot that tree. Long live the establishment, the Union, the American state, and may they be possessed of immense powers over our lives <U+2014> these became the social and political reality. Trump isn<U+2019>t going to change it. He<U+2019>s a president administering a presidency. He<U+2019>s at the top of the heap. His credo is still <U+201C>Long Live the Establishment!<U+201D> Reprinted with permission from LewRockwell.com . Related",

        "input": "time: null \n author: WILLIAM S. COHEN GARY HART \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/opinion/dont-retreat-into-fortress-america.html?_r=0 \n text: Former Secretary of State Dean Acheson<U+2019>s memoir, <U+201C>Present at the Creation,<U+201D> is a classic account of how a durable and productive Atlantic alliance, based on common values and a cleareyed judgment of America<U+2019>s strategic interests, rebuilt Europe after World War II and produced international institutions responsible for the security and expanding economic opportunities that have been of such benefit to the United States. Today we are faced with this question: Will two remarkable events within the past several months, the Brexit vote in Britain and the election of Donald J. Trump as president, threaten to undo what Harry S. Truman, George C. Marshall, Acheson, Dwight D. Eisenhower and their farsighted counterparts in Europe and Asia created 70 years ago? Acheson<U+2019>s book recounts the struggles, the intense negotiations and the occasionally brilliant statecraft that established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . The foundations of NATO became the European Union and other international institutions. They also led to the Bretton Woods agreement stabilizing currencies; the Marshall Plan, which saved much of Europe from tyranny; efforts to devise an international understanding on nuclear weapons; and development of the Truman Doctrine, which halted Communist expansion in Europe. These eventually led to border arrangements that produced freer flows of people and goods, a common currency in much of Europe and, most of all, a stable and secure trans-Atlantic region. These institutions, while not perfect and always ripe for reform and evolution to meet contemporary challenges, have brought prosperity to millions and created a remarkably peaceful period in a European history filled with costly wars. All this and more represented the foundation of an international order not just in Europe but also Asia that would last, with several detours, until 2016. As the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election showed, too many of our fellow citizens feel left out of this history. But, if he is to be taken at his word, Mr. Trump now proposes that these international arrangements be called into question, so far without much of a plan beyond retreating to <U+201C>Fortress America.<U+201D> On some issues, he has a point: Those NATO allies that have not met their promises to contribute more should help pay for the common defense. But calling into question the solemn guarantee to defend a NATO ally that is attacked can lead only to a test of wills with Russia. Mr. Trump also proposes to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, enacted in 1994 with bipartisan congressional support. Explicitly or implicitly, he offers encouragement to right-wing leaders and parties in several European nations, virtually all of whom share nationalistic and xenophobic beliefs and who wish to erect barriers to immigration similar to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s wall for the border with Mexico. Or take Mr. Trump<U+2019>s vow to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, produced after many months of intense multilateral negotiations, and to cancel the Climate Action Plan created by the Obama administration. Virtually the entire world has signed the Paris accord. Unilateral abrogation would be a huge blow to the United States<U+2019> international credibility, and make it impossible for the world to meet the carbon emissions goals necessary to stall global warming . Addressing climate change is not just about <U+201C>soft power.<U+201D> Senior military commanders believe that global warming threatens to become a major security problem, with mass migrations from coastal cities and major disruptions in agricultural production. The United States is engaged in a global debate about who will set standards for the future on crucial questions like international governance, human rights, the protection of free market principles and the resolution of problems without resort to force. This matters to Americans, and particularly to the Americans who voted for Mr. Trump and will still have to compete in the global marketplace for jobs, despite the wish that the country go it alone. Truman, Marshall, Acheson and Eisenhower, through their belief in having the strongest military in the world to back a focused and creative diplomacy, put America in a position to lead the world for 70 years. Will Mr. Trump cede that responsibility to Moscow, Beijing or Tehran? The anchor of American military presence in Europe and Asia, including bases and fleets, contributes mightily to stability in both regions. There is no benefit to America in a world where individual nations develop their own security arrangements, including, quite probably, nuclear arsenals. North Korea should be example enough. The surprise, if not shock, of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory lingers. Predictably, much of the focus is on the domestic changes his election may bring. But serious foreign policy experts and institutions must process the implications of his victory and the Brexit vote and place them within the lessons of the post-World War II world. Wise leaders such as Truman, Eisenhower, Marshall and Acheson constructed a temple in which freedom could thrive and economies could prosper. The interior of the temple may be in need of renovation, but Mr. Trump should not pull apart its central pillars and bring it crashing down. William S.

The biggest winners in the post-election advance: Wall Street<U+2019>s largest banks. Stocks in some of the biggest financial firms in the world, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase are rocketing higher after Trump<U+2019>s shocking win on hopes for a lighter regulatory hand and the big role that experienced Wall Street veterans could play in the new administration. Story Continued Below <U+201C>The pre-election narrative was wrong,<U+201D> said Christopher Whalen, head of research at Kroll Bond Rating Agency. <U+201C>We all assumed we were entering an era of left-wing democracy. But now we have a pro-growth GOP president and a pro-growth GOP Congress and we have to completely reset the narrative.<U+201D> Shares in Goldman were up about 9 percent as of midday Thursday following the election. Morgan Stanley was up 10 percent and JPMorgan Chase nearly 9 percent, helping drive the broader market higher. <U+201C>Banks are rising because of the likely relaxation of Dodd-Frank and other banking legislation which has been expensive and burdensome,<U+201D> said Douglas Kass, founder of Seabreeze Partners, who has written a book on the sector and covered it for decades. <U+201C>And bank stocks right now are cheap and undervalued.<U+201D> The gains came as markets rallied back from a huge overnight selloff as Trump<U+2019>s victory appeared increasingly assured Tuesday night. The Dow is now up about 2 percent since Trump<U+2019>s win, defying warnings from academics and traders that his victory over Hillary Clinton would spark a market meltdown. Big banks are performing better than the broader market for several clear reasons, experts say. Investors are no longer worried that an ascendant liberal wing of the Democratic Party, led by Elizabeth Warren, will impose tough new regulations including higher capital standards. And Trump<U+2019>s inner-circle of advisers is peppered with Wall Street executives not likely to push for a big crackdown on the financial industry. They include investor Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman executive rumored for Treasury Secretary under Trump as well as billionaire investor Wilbur Ross and economist David Malpass, who worked at Bear Stearns for 15 years. By Nolan D. McCaskill CNBC reported Thursday that some Trump advisers would like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon for Treasury secretary. Dimon has repeatedly said he does not want the job and nothing about that has changed, according to those who know him. Still, the universe of names in play has investors in bank stocks giddy. And there remains some hope that direct appeals from Trump to serve the country could eventually sway those like Dimon who profess no interest in top jobs. During the George W. Bush administration, then-Goldman Sachs CEO Hank Paulson turned down the job of Treasury secretary. But when the financial crisis emerged he relented and agreed to serve. But overall, the relief on Wall Street suggests many believe the era of bankers as national villains is coming to an end. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s not just that there is now a Republican president, it<U+2019>s that Republicans held the Senate and that<U+2019>s quite important,<U+201D> said Michael Mayo, a veteran banking industry analyst now at CLSA. <U+201C>As of Nov. 8th, the financial crisis is over. As of that day we go from bashing banks to using banks to help facilitate economic growth.<U+201D> The gains on Wall Street are not limited to banks. The broader market is rallying on hopes that a Trump administration will push for big fiscal stimulus for the economy including large infrastructure spending. By Madeline Conway The Dow was up more than 200 points in afternoon trading on Thursday, a second day of gains led by financial, pharmaceutical and defense companies all expected to fare well under Trump, who has proposed to shred thousands of existing regulations and cut taxes for businesses and individuals. That<U+2019>s caused an entire rethinking of the political paradigm on Wall Street. For now, fear over Trump<U+2019>s erratic campaign persona has been eclipsed by hope for what he might achieve. For bank lobbyists in Washington, the hope is less that Trump will immediately shred the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law <U+2014> though some hope he will <U+2014> but that all of the new scrutiny and tougher regulations they feared from a Clinton presidency and a Democratic senate is now gone. <U+201C>People are realistic about getting rid of existing regulations,<U+201D> one top bank lobbyist said on Thursday. <U+201C>But at least the piling-on and fresh attacks seem like they will go away.<U+201D> The advance in bank stocks also reflects that the biggest firms built up heavy capital cushions and restructured their balance sheets following the crisis and are in much stronger shape than they were eight years ago. <U+201C>Banks have record capital and liquidity now and they can shift from being on defense to going on offense,<U+201D> Mayo said. <U+201C>For the last several years they played defense by adding capital and liquidity and dealing with regulators. Now they can move back to offense and deploy some of that extra capital.<U+201D> By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

According to an SVT report, The Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) will not allow municipalities to erect Christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages, meaning that many towns will have no festival lights at all on major streets. According to Speisa , <U+201C>The change is a victory for those who want to tone down the reminder of the country<U+2019>s Christian traditions, but according to the Swedish Transport Administration, the decision for the drastic change is <U+201C>security<U+201D>. <U+201C>Poles are not designed for the weight of Christmas lights, and we have to remove anything that should not be there,<U+201D> said Eilin Isaksson, national coordinator at the Swedish Transport Administration. The argument that the lights are too heavy and pose a safety risk sounds like complete baloney. Swedes are being asked to believe that lights normally held up by tree branches are now too weighty to be supported by metal poles. Despite there being no safety issue with the street lights for decades, this new rule has been instituted right after record numbers of Muslim migrants flooded into the country <U+2013> just a coincidence I<U+2019>m sure. In reality, the Christmas lights ban is almost certainly an effort to avoid offending Muslim migrants who are causing chaos in cities like Malmo , where the firebombing of cars and businesses in or near Muslim ghetto <U+2018>no-go areas<U+2019> is becoming a routine occurrence. As we previously reported , a top Swedish Bishop advocated removing crosses from a Christian church and replacing them with Islamic symbols in order to please Muslims. Last Christmas, it was also announced that a Christmas Eve special broadcast on public television would be hosted by a Muslim woman. Some areas of Sweden are even capitulating to returning ISIS terrorists by offering jihadists free driving licenses and housing benefits to help them <U+201C>reintegrate into the job market<U+201D>.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/metal-prices-climb-as-china-backs-free-trade-zone-1479720290 \n text: Metal prices rallied Monday, despite a strengthening dollar, as a pledge by China<U+2019>s president to support a free-trade area in the Asia-Pacific boosted optimism about Chinese demand. Typically, a strong dollar weighs on metal prices because it makes sales to China and other emerging markets more expensive. But positive sentiment around China along with hopes that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will boost infrastructure spending pushed prices higher. Three-month copper futures on the London Metal Exchange rose 2.5% to $5,560 a ton, zinc gained 2.1% to $2,596.5 a ton and nickel was up 3.2% to $11,165 a ton. <U+201C>Normally a higher dollar value is not good for commodity prices, but this time around it is different because dollar strength is on account of hopes of U.S. economy getting better,<U+201D> says Helen Lau, analyst with Argonaut Research. <U+201C>Now that is good for commodities consumption.<U+201D> Hopes of freer trade flows and the prospect of more imports by China, the world<U+2019>s largest consumer of metals, buoyed investor sentiment, Ms. Lau said. In a speech to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru, on Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said his government would support a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific and was pushing forward with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a trade pact that includes 16 countries. China, the world<U+2019>s second-biggest economy after the U.S., could take on a greater role in global trade if Mr. Trump<U+2019>s administration pulls out of U.S.-led accords, analysts say. In the next five years, China will import $8 trillion of goods and invest $750 billion abroad, Mr. Xi said. In the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election, Mr. Trump vowed to review trade pacts and impose across-the-board tariffs on imports from China, a large exporter of metals to the U.S. <U+201C>Of course, I think there is a certain element of uncertainty going forward, especially as we are not sure about the policies of the U.S. president-elect,<U+201D> said Ms. Lau. Metal prices have zigzagged over the past two to three weeks. Most base metal prices, including copper, zinc, aluminum, nickel and lead, tumbled when it became clear that Mr. Trump was headed to a surprise victory because traders were unclear about his policy positions. Those price moves later reversed course. Analysts expect metal prices to be volatile in the near term. If the U.S. Federal Reserve raises rates next month, the rally in metals prices would likely be capped by dollar strength. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election coincides with a global metals glut. In recent months, Chinese metal producers have added to the oversupply by stepping up output, which has partly been supported by a pickup in China<U+2019>s housing market and infrastructure spending. Chinese cities have recently taken measures to curb speculation in the property market. <U+201C>The Chinese construction sector is likely to experience headwinds because of restrictions that are now being imposed, though overall the investment climate [in the nation] appears to be far more stable,<U+201D> said Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank.

Chris Christie could secure a position in President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s administration drew attention Wednesday to Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, who would fill the state<U+2019>s highest office should Mr. Christie resign for a job in Washington. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump and aides to Mr. Christie didn<U+2019>t respond to requests for comment. Mr. Christie, a Republican, was selected by Mr. Trump in May to lead the transition to the White House. If Mr. Christie steps down, New Jersey<U+2019>s Constitution stipulates that the lieutenant governor would become governor and serve out the remainder of the current term, state officials said. <U+201C>I am prepared to serve as governor should Governor Christie become part of the new administration,<U+201D> Mrs. Guadagno said in a statement. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s what lieutenant governors do.<U+201D> Mr. Christie is prevented by term limits from running for a third term and is scheduled to leave office in January 2018. The general election for his successor is next November. Former Goldman Sachs executive Phil Murphy is the front-runner for Democratic nomination in the race. Mrs. Guadagno, 57, a Monmouth Beach resident and former federal prosecutor, was elected on Mr. Christie<U+2019>s ticket in 2009. The governor had her oversee the New Jersey Department of State and run economic development initiatives. Mrs. Guadagno has largely operated in the background during her time in Trenton, said Brigid Harrison, who teaches political science and law at Montclair State University. <U+201C>Chris Christie is such a large presence that there wasn<U+2019>t a whole lot of room for the lieutenant governor, given his strong personality,<U+201D> Ms. Harrison said. <U+201C>In my view, her talents were probably underutilized for most of her tenure.<U+201D> Mrs. Guadagno is well-known and respected in the state<U+2019>s business community, said Tom Bracken, president and chief executive of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce. The lieutenant governor chaired the state<U+2019>s Red Tape Review Commission, which Mr. Bracken credited with eliminating <U+201C>a lot of the regulations that have impeded business growth.<U+201D> <U+201C>She<U+2019>s been great,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>She<U+2019>s been very attentive to the business community.<U+201D> The lieutenant governor, who told The Wall Street Journal last year that she was <U+201C>thinking about<U+201D> running to succeed Mr. Christie, has low name recognition statewide. But serving as governor would give her greater exposure and greatly improve her chances of winning the Republican nomination and the general election, Ms. Harrison said. <U+201C>If the governor steps down<U+2026>she will be able to forge her own legacy,<U+201D> she said. Mrs. Guadagno is the first person to serve as lieutenant governor in New Jersey. The position was created through a 2005 ballot referendum held after two governors<U+2014>in a span of less than five years<U+2014>left their posts before the end of their terms. Richard Codey was unexpectedly thrust into the state<U+2019>s top office in 2004, when Democratic Gov. Jim McGreevey admitted to an affair and resigned his post. At the time, New Jersey<U+2019>s succession plan called for the state Senate President to assume the governorship. Mr. Codey, then the Senate president, served as both New Jersey<U+2019>s governor and as the state Senate president for 14 months. <U+201C>I was scared, I didn<U+2019>t know what to expect,<U+201D> said Mr. Codey, a Democrat who is now a state senator. <U+201C>I had been [in the Legislature] a long time, but being in the No. 1 seat is totally different.<U+201D> Mr. Codey said Mrs. Guadagno<U+2019>s biggest challenge, should she become governor, will be to forge relationships with state lawmakers to advance her agenda. Mrs. Guadagno, who became the first female sheriff in Monmouth County in 2007, has never served in the state Legislature. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s going to be a learning experience and, at the same time, she<U+2019>s going to have to decide whether or not she<U+2019>s going to run,<U+201D> Mr. Codey said, noting that the filing deadline for the 2017 gubernatorial race is in April.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Pete Dolack \n source: counterpunch.org \n text: Email \nClass warfare is poised to reach a new milestone as this year<U+2019>s combined total of dividends and stock buybacks by 500 of the world<U+2019>s largest corporations will exceed US$1 trillion. \nSo large is that figure that, for the second year in a row, the companies comprising the S&P 500 Index (a list of many of the world<U+2019>s biggest corporations) will pay out more money in dividends and stock buybacks than the total of their profits. Yes, times are indeed good for speculators. Not so good for employees <U+2014> you know, the people who do the actual work <U+2014> whose pay is stagnant or declining so that those at the top can scoop up still more. \nAlthough dividends, a quarterly payment to holders of stock, are steadily increasing, the increase in stock buybacks has been steeper. The total of these has tripled since 2009 as financiers and industrialists feverishly extract as much wealth as they can. This is part of why the <U+201C>recovery<U+201D> since the 2008 economic collapse has been a recovery only for those at the top. \nIn short, a buyback is when a corporation buys its own stock from its shareholders at a premium to the current price. Speculators love buybacks because it means extra profits for them. Corporate executives love them because, with fewer shares outstanding following a buyback program, their company<U+2019>s <U+201C>earnings per share<U+201D> figure will rise for the same net income, making them look good in the eyes of Wall Street. Remaining shareholders love buybacks because the profits will now be shared among fewer shareholders. \nWall Street and corporate executives both win! Hurrah! Who could by hurt by this? Oh, yes, the employees. They<U+2019>ll have to suffer through pay freezes, work speedups and layoffs because the money shoveled into executive pay and financial industry profits has to come from somewhere. This sort of activity helps buoy stock prices. So does the trillions of dollars the world<U+2019>s central banks have printed to sustain their <U+201C>quantitative easing<U+201D> programs. \nWe<U+2019>re not talking loose change here. The U.S. Federal Reserve pumped $4.1 trillion into its three rounds of quantitative easing; the Bank of England spent <U+00A3>375 billion; the European Central Bank has spent about <U+20AC>1.34 trillion; and the Bank of Japan has spent <U+00A5>220 trillion so far. That<U+2019>s a total of US$8 trillion or <U+20AC>7.4 trillion. And the last two programs are ongoing. \nEncouraging investment or inflating bubbles? \nThe supposed purpose of quantitative-easing programs is to stimulate the economy by encouraging investment. Under this theory, a reduction in long-term interest rates would encourage working people to buy or refinance homes; encourage businesses to invest because they could borrow cheaply; and push down the value of the currency, thereby boosting exports by making locally made products more competitive. \nIn actuality, quantitative-easing programs cause the interest rates on bonds to fall because a central bank buying bonds in bulk significantly increases demand for them, enabling bond sellers to offer lower interest rates. Seeking assets with a better potential payoff, speculators buy stock instead, driving up stock prices and inflating a stock-market bubble. Money not used in speculation ends up parked in bank coffers, boosting bank profits, or is borrowed by businesses to buy back more of their stock, another method of driving up stock prices without making any investments. \nThe practical effects of all this is to re-distribute income upward . That is the raison d<U+2019><U+00EA>tre of the financial industry. \nWhat else could be done with the vast sums of money thrown at the financial industry? In the U.S. alone, home to a steadily crumbling infrastructure, the money needed to eliminate all student debt, fix all schools, rebuild aging water and sewer systems, clean up contaminated industrial sites and repair dams is estimated to be $3.4 trillion <U+2014> in other words, $700 billion less than the Federal Reserve spent on its quantitative-easing program. \nThe British think tank Policy Exchange estimates Britain<U+2019>s needs for investment in transportation, communication and water infrastructure to be a minimum of <U+00A3>170 billion, or less than half of what the Bank of England spent on its QE scheme. \nBorrowing to give more to speculators \nTo return to the $1 trillion in dividends and buybacks, a research report by Barclays estimates that those payouts by S&P 500 corporations will total about $115 billion more than their combined net income. As a Zero Hedge analysis puts it: \n<U+201C>[C]ompanies will promptly send every single dollar in cash they create back to their shareholders, and then use up an additional $115 billion from cash on the balance sheet, sell equity or issue new debt, to fund the difference.<U+201D> \nNear-zero interest rates, another central bank policy that favors the financial industry, have enabled this accumulation of debt. Debt not for investment, but simply to shovel more money into the pockets of financiers and executives. But debt can<U+2019>t increase forever, and someday, perhaps in the not too distant future, central banks will raise interest rates, making debt much less attractive. The Barclays report calculates that 2015 also saw buybacks and dividends total more than net income; the last time there was consecutive years in which this happened were 2007 and 2008. \nIt would of course be too simplistic to interpret this metric as a signal that an economic collapse on the scale of 2008 is imminent, but is perhaps a sign that the latest stock market bubble may be close to bursting. \nAnother signal that trouble may be looming is that money is now being shoveled into bonds, a sign that confidence in the stock market is waning. A New York Times report suggests that European and Asian investors (the Times of course is much too genteel to use the word <U+201C>speculator<U+201D>) are pouring so much capital into U.S. bond markets that a bubble is being inflated there as well. These speculators are seeking higher returns from bonds floated by U.S. corporations than they can get at home. The Times reports : \n<U+201C>The surge in flows echoes a wave of investment in the years right before the financial crisis, when mostly European investors snapped up billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities before the American housing market imploded. \nThe current numbers are also arresting. According to [former Treasury Department official Brad W.] Setser<U+2019>s figures, about $750 billion of private money has poured into the United States in the last two years alone.<U+201D> \nStarved for investment \nSetting aside the touch of xenophobia in it, the Times report does at least broach the subject of under-investment. And wealthy investors possessing far more money than can possibly be invested is hardly an unknown phenomenon. As an example, let us examine Wal-Mart, which racked up more than $16 billion in net income for 2015 and seems poised to better that this year. \nThe Walton family, heirs to founder Sam Walton, owns about half of Wal-Mart<U+2019>s stock and receive a corresponding share of the billions of dollars in dividends the company pays yearly. It also spends billions more buying back stock annually, an indirect help to the Waltons. This is a company notorious for dodging taxes while paying its employees so little they require government assistance, and is the recipient of vast amounts of government handouts . \nThe Waltons make tens of thousands times what their ill-paid employees earn. They certainly don<U+2019>t work tens of thousands harder <U+2014> or even work at all, as the billions roll in just for being born into the right family. Wan-Mart is far from alone, but does provide an exemplary example of class warfare. An estimated $1 trillion a year goes to corporate profits that once went to wages, according to a PBS Newshour report. \nThe harder you work, the more the boss, and financiers, make.

Mr. Philzone met Mr. Trump a couple of times at Elaine<U+2019>s and said he even witnessed him behaving in a <U+201C>crass<U+201D> manner. <U+201C>But if you work in construction, you<U+2019>ve got to have that in your repertoire,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s part of your game.<U+201D> A suave older gent, Lee Peck, was sitting by himself at the end of the bar and looking amused. Mr. Peck, a retired banker, has been going to Neary<U+2019>s since the early 1970s. <U+201C>We used to come up here Friday nights after work and sit at the bar,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>A lot of Friday nights. It<U+2019>s a great watering hole, a lot of good people.<U+201D> Mr. Peck, though a longtime conservative, voted for Hillary Clinton . <U+201C>Trump just turned me off, but he<U+2019>s president, so I have to root for him. So hopefully he<U+2019>s going to be O.K.,<U+201D> he said, and then gestured toward the owner of the bar, Jimmy Neary. <U+201C>Jimmy loves him.

John Glenn. And I said to myself, <U+2018>If I wasn<U+2019>t in business another week, I still had the first man to orbit the earth in my restaurant.<U+2019><U+201D> (Well, the first American, anyway.) Gov. Hugh Carey was one of the first politicians to become a regular, back when he had just started his seven-term Congressional run. The Kennedys came, and the Clintons, and Mayor Bloomberg, who took Mr. Neary to Ireland on his private jet to visit the village where the proprietor was born. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has been there, too. Gay Talese went for dinner recently. Mary Higgins Clark is a regular, and Mr. Neary has shown up as a character in 21 of her novels and even solves a murder in one. With his wife of 40 years, Eileen (<U+201C>now in heaven<U+201D>), he raised four children. His daughter Una Neary is at the restaurant on the weekends, usually in a hostess role but always available to fill in as a waitress, if needed. She is also a partner at Goldman Sachs, the head of bank holding company compliance. On Veterans Day at the bar, Ms. Neary recognized the country<U+2019>s servicemen and women, then added: <U+201C>Today is also another extra special day because on 11/11/1954, is when my father came to America.<U+201D> The place erupted with cheering and clapping. Then Ms. Neary asked everyone to sing <U+201C>God Bless America,<U+201D> which they did with gusto.

In the bombardment, 30 Afghan civilians were martyred and 25 others were wounded,<U+201D> media outlets quoted provincial spokesman, Mahmood Danish, as saying. \nAirstrike sparks anti-US protest rally \nFollowing the deadly airstrike, dozens of the relatives of those killed in the US-led raid staged a demonstration outside the governor<U+2019>s office in Kunduz to condemn the attack as they were carrying the bodies of the victims. \n<U+201C>I am heartbroken.

Were they Taliban?<U+201D> said Taza Gul, a 55-year-old laborer, adding, <U+201C>No, they were innocent children.<U+201D> \nAfghan government forces are engaged in fierce fighting against the militants in and around Kunduz. Relatives and members of civilians sit next the dead body of a man who was killed during clashes between Afghan security forces and the Taliban in Kunduz, Afghanistan November 3, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) \nTaliban militants briefly overran the city of Kunduz, the provincial capital with the same name, in early October. They had briefly seized control of the city a year earlier but they were pushed out of Kunduz weeks later. They now seek to gain full control over the city. \nTaliban militants were removed from power following the 2001 US-led invasion of Afghanistan, but they have stepped up their activities in recent months, attempting to overrun several provinces. \nAfghan forces have been engaged in fierce clashes with Taliban to contain the ongoing insurgency across various parts of the violence-wrecked country. \nThe rising violence in Afghanistan comes despite the presence of thousands of foreign troops in the country.",

This declares that refugees are entitled to claim asylum regardless of their method of reaching a country, if they say they have been persecuted in their country of origin. The government<U+2019>s plan would prevent migrants from visiting Australia many years later, while on business or as tourists, even if they have successfully settled in a third country and gained citizenship there. \n<U+201C>It<U+2019>s the most draconian legislation the world has ever seen, it<U+2019>s unprecedented in global terms, and it means that Australia puts itself, yet again, in the basket of pariah states when it comes to those sorts of issues ,<U+201D> Barns said. \nTurnbull<U+2019>s Liberal Party will require the support of opposition parties to pass the legislation. While Bill Shorten, leader of Australia<U+2019>s opposition Labor Party, said the proposal <U+201C>seems ridiculous,<U+201D> his party stopped short of rejecting it and instead promised to examine the plan closely. \n<U+201C>Unfortunately the opposition Labor Party in Australia has been very weak on these issues in recent years, and both the major political parties, the conservatives (Australia<U+2019>s Liberal Party) and the Labor Party, have been able to force these sorts of changes on Australian policy,<U+201D> Barns told Sputnik. \n<U+201C>There have been suggestions today that the Labor Party might finally get some backbone and oppose this legislation, because if the Labor Party, which is the major opposition party, supports this legislation, then it will become a reality.<U+201D> \nThe government<U+2019>s claim that their proposal is compliant with international law is <U+201C>laughable,<U+201D> and <U+201C>shows yet again that Australia snubs its nose at international law when it suits it,<U+201D> Barns said. \nBarns said that Australia<U+2019>s immigration policy has become harsher as a result of public fears of migration, and the actions of successive government which have played on these fears. \n<U+201C>Some Australians have a xenophobic, racist view about the rest of the world, they have this ridiculous fear about hordes coming to this island continent and invading it, that<U+2019>s been historic.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>If you don<U+2019>t have strong political leadership which says that we can do better, this will become politically popular,<U+201D> said Barns, who contrasted the current policy with that of Malcom Fraser<U+2019>s 1970<U+2019>s Liberal government, which accepted large numbers of refugees who came on boats from Vietnam. \nSince the government of John Howard from 1996 to 2007, <U+201C>successive governments in Australia have pandered to the xenophobic, racist side of the country, and that<U+2019>s precisely what Malcolm Turnbull is doing with this legislation.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>Australia is a nation built on migration, and in fact some of the leading figures in Australian society came here by boat. Those very same people now would be banned under this law.<U+201D> \nTurnbull<U+2019>s proposal has won the praise of Australia<U+2019>s right-wing populist One Nation party, led by Pauline Hanson, who won re-election to Australia<U+2019>s House of Representatives this year. Good to see that it looks like the Government is now taking its cues from One Nation. Just like last time. #auspol #PHON #Nauru #Manus https://t.co/c0GQew7vR8 \n<U+2014> Pauline Hanson (@PaulineHansonOz) 30 October 2016 \nBarns said that Turnbull<U+2019>s proposal is an effort to attract votes from Hanson<U+2019>s One Nation to the conservative Liberal Party. \n<U+201C>Malcolm Turnbull<U+2019>s party wants to try and take over some of its vote, and it seems to be that this is the way to do it. To pass outrageous, draconian laws that trash Australia<U+2019>s reputation even further in world eyes when it comes to refugees, simply for short-term political gain.<U+201D>",

Vogel Kyle Cheney Nahal Toosi Jack Shafer \n source: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/david-brock-donald-trump-donor-network-231588 \n text: Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s attack dog David Brock is launching his own Koch-brothers-like donor network to finance attacks on President-elect Donald Trump and to rebuild the political left after Trump<U+2019>s stunning victory over Clinton last week. Brock on Thursday night emailed more than 200 of the biggest donors on the left <U+2014> including finance titans George Soros, Tom Steyer and Donald Sussman <U+2014> inviting them to a retreat in Palm Beach over inauguration weekend to assess what Democrats did wrong in 2016, figure out how to correct it and raise cash for those initiatives. Story Continued Below <U+201C>This will be THE gathering for Democratic donors from across the country to hear from a broad and diverse group of leaders about the next steps for progressives under a Trump Administration,<U+201D> Brock wrote to the donors in an email obtained by POLITICO. The retreat, planned as the first in a series of regular gatherings, will feature appearances by an array of Democratic elected officials, operatives and liberal thinkers and group officials, Brock explained in an interview. Though he said he had yet to extend invitations beyond those sent to donors Thursday night, he predicted there would be significant interest, noting that the keynote address at his last major donor conference, back in 2013, was delivered by former President Bill Clinton. <U+201C>What better way to spend inaugural weekend than talking about how to kick Donald Trump<U+2019>s ass?<U+201D> Brock said. Congress By Kyle Cheney Brock <U+2014> a self-described right-wing hitman-turned-Clinton enforcer <U+2014> has used his relationships with some of the left<U+2019>s deepest pockets to build an armada of aggressive political outfits that have become pillars of the institutional left and that raised a combined $65 million during the 2016 cycle. Brock<U+2019>s groups include the conservative media monitoring nonprofit Media Matters, the opposition research super PAC American Bridge and the legal watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Other groups in his network include the liberal media-funding vehicle American Independent Institute, the media-training nonprofit Franklin Forum and the for-profit social media operation ShareBlue, which The New York Times described as <U+201C> Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s Outrage Machine .<U+201D> A seventh group, a super PAC called Correct the Record that was created to coordinate directly with Clinton<U+2019>s campaign , is winding down, though Brock said that a number of its functions and personnel likely will be absorbed by his other groups. While the entire political left is grappling with how to move on after Clinton<U+2019>s devastating loss, it could be a particular challenge for Brock and his groups, since he was so closely associated with Clinton. Brock acknowledged in the interview: \"There is no question that we poured our heart and soul into this election for Hillary, but these institutions were built before her campaign and were intended to outlast it.<U+201D> And in his email to donors, he pointed out that he created Media Matters more than a decade ago to help the left push back during George W. Bush<U+2019>s presidency. <U+201C>In 2005, we were part of a successful progressive effort to regroup, retool and recover,<U+201D> he wrote. <U+201C>While today<U+2019>s situation is more dire, media matters more than ever.<U+201D> One of the areas where the left has been at a disadvantage is using the legal and regulatory system to call out Republican politicians and groups, Brock said. He cited the success of the conservative group Judicial Watch in using the Freedom of Information Act and legal system to pry free emails from Clinton<U+2019>s State Department. Presidential Transition By Nahal Toosi <U+201C>Judicial Watch has a $30 million budget, and they had a significant impact on the election,<U+201D> he said, comparing it to CREW<U+2019>s $2-million budget. <U+201C>And if we<U+2019>re heading into an administration that looks like it could well be as corrupt as the gilded age, we need to significantly reinforce the capacities for an aggressive ethics watchdog.<U+201D> The Palm Beach retreat in some ways seems to be a challenge to the 12-year-old Democracy Alliance, a club of liberal financiers that was started by Soros and a handful of other major donors to fund the institutional left . In fact, the club, which held its annual winter meeting this week in Washington, helped launch Media Matters, and many of Brock<U+2019>s donors are included among its ranks. Brock said he<U+2019>s inviting the president of the DA, as the club is known, to his Palm Beach retreat. But, while the Democracy Alliance at its winter meeting discussed ways to push back on the Trump administration, many of the group<U+2019>s members have tried to train its focus on pressuring Democrats from the left on issues like fighting climate change, money in politics and drug laws. Brock<U+2019>s network, on the other hand, is more overtly and aggressively political, and has been largely agnostic on the philosophical divisions with which Democrats are grappling. <U+201C>We don<U+2019>t think of this as representing a faction of the Democratic Party, but a cross-section of it, so we<U+2019>re not going to precook things ideologically,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>It is very politically minded, and there is an urgency to it.<U+201D> By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

Always quick to condemn the sexual behavior of others in the past, evangelical leaders have chosen to look the other way regarding the outrageous sexual behavior of their candidate. In the apparent hope that a Trump Supreme Court will finally make all abortions illegal in this country, they have willingly signed on with a candidate who sexually degrades and humiliates women. No matter which way you slice it, women cannot win with this bunch. DARLEE CROCKETT La Jolla, Calif. To the Editor: Ross Douthat writes about politics as if the religious right is and has been the only home for Christians. New York<U+2019>s great liberal senator, Robert Wagner, was born an ordinary German, married Irish and was buried Catholic. Some of us still see his work <U+2014> Social Security, labor and racial justice <U+2014> as the secular expression of the great papal encyclical, <U+201C>Rerum Novarum.<U+201D> Perhaps the Democrats of today no longer have a place for us, but as I hear from my relatives and college friends, it is fair to say that we are still closer to Wagner<U+2019>s vision for America than we are to Mr. Douthat<U+2019>s, and that Donald Trump is anathema. JAMES F. McMANUS III Phoenix To the Editor: Ross Douthat thinks that religious conservatives are needed. But the rigid religious longing for and insistence on a return of bygone days and ways, coupled with a maddeningly plastic embrace of an irreligious candidate who fails any reasonable test of responsible ethical and moral standards, shows how much harm they can do, not how needed they are. Indeed, as fanatics of every stripe seem intent on proving, when a deity is perceived to be on their side, horrific actions are made defensible. If one historical figure religious conservatives recognize were around today, he might say it<U+2019>s time to drive the religious from the temple of democracy. JOHN CLARK Warren, N.J. To the Editor: I can<U+2019>t think of two more contemporary defenders of Christianity<U+2019>s bedrock beliefs than Ben Carson and Jerry Falwell Jr., mentioned by Ross Douthat in his column. In contrast, the column underscores the dilution of every Judeo-Christian belief by a political community called America. We are no longer a country of religious believers as extolled by de Tocqueville in his masterpiece, <U+201C>Democracy in America.<U+201D> We<U+2019>ve succumbed to an apostate electorate, what Plato<U+2019>s <U+201C>Republic<U+201D> called democracy<U+2019>s next step, a tyranny of the masses. TERENCE O<U+2019>FLANAGAN Rockville Centre, N.Y. To the Editor: As we left a funeral the other day, I asked my uncle, a Catholic priest, what the bishops were doing about this election. I asked because I used to argue with my father about his votes for president. <U+201C>The bishops tell me my soul is in danger if I vote for a Democrat who supports abortion,<U+201D> my father would say. <U+201C>So it<U+2019>s O.K. to vote for someone who believes in the death penalty but not abortion?<U+201D> was my retort. The last Democrat he got to vote against was Bill Clinton. And my dad was a Democrat. My uncle the priest told me that the bishops still believe that abortion is the gravest sin (he disagrees), but that this year they were telling their flocks to listen to their consciences. Either these old men have finally seen a Republican too vile and repugnant to endorse, or the Nuns on the Bus have really won the hearts and minds of American Catholics.

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexicos-options-in-a-trump-trade-war-1479680567 \n text: If the sharp selloff of the Mexican peso after the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump were set to music it might sound like a funeral dirge, the dearly departed being the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The peso has fallen to an all-time low of more than 20 to the dollar, and on Thursday the Bank of Mexico raised its benchmark interest rate to stem the bleeding. Mexico investors are worried that Mr. Trump might actually believe<U+2014>as he argued in his campaign<U+2014>that U.S. productivity growth and job creation depend on renegotiating Nafta to discourage U.S. investments south of the border. But Mexico won<U+2019>t easily yield to a new deal that limits its access to U.S. markets in order to make it less attractive as a destination for capital. If Mr. Trump counters with tariff hikes in violation of Nafta, Mexico is likely to respond with its own duty increases. It did this with $2.4 billion in retaliatory tariffs on important U.S. export products in 2009 when the U.S. failed to live up to its Nafta obligation in trucking. There is even the possibility that Mr. Trump will carry out his threat to tear up the agreement. There are no winners in any of these narratives. In the 23 years since Nafta was launched, Mexico has cultivated a middle-class, a more-vibrant democracy and a diversified economy far less dependent than it once was on oil. The country now sends 80% of its exports to the U.S. A trade war would be an economic disaster and open the door to political instability. Thus it won<U+2019>t be so easy for Mr. Trump to bully the neighbors. National pride will play a role in stiffening the Mexican spine, and President Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto <U+2019>s government is signaling that it intends to face any crisis by deepening structural reforms, getting its fiscal house in order and looking more aggressively for new trading partners. The unspoken message to Mr. Trump is that if he plays the protectionist game, Mexico is ready to raise the stakes. Nafta<U+2019>s demise would be bad for the U.S. too, although the U.S. stock market rally suggests that the fear of a trade war is overblown. Protectionist steel and textile tycoon Wilbur Ross is rumored to be in line for a job in the new administration. But Vice President-elect Mike Pence is a free trader from Indiana, which in 2015 exported $4.8 billion in goods to Mexico, its second-largest export market. From time to time Mr. Trump has had flashes of sanity on trade. In a joint press conference with Mr. Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto in Mexico in August, then-candidate Trump spoke of the need to <U+201C>keep manufacturing wealth in our hemisphere.<U+201D> Some expect the Trump administration to find a way to largely leave Nafta alone while it works on legitimate trade issues like China<U+2019>s practice of intellectual-property theft. Mexico seems to want to help in this face-saving endeavor and has wisely decided not to escalate the rhetoric. It doesn<U+2019>t need to: Americans have plenty to lose if Nafta is destroyed. Many U.S. corporations are now heavily invested in supply chains that crisscross the continent to create globally competitive products. These support millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs. Saying goodbye to duty-free access to Mexico under Nafta also would hit U.S. agricultural exports hard. Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told Reuters on Nov. 10 that his government is <U+201C>ready to talk so we can explain the strategic importance of Nafta for the region. Here we<U+2019>re not talking about . . . renegotiating it, we<U+2019>re simply talking about dialogue.<U+201D> He also said Mexico will look for new markets, adding to more than 40 existing free-trade agreements. It had hoped for expanded opportunities via the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation accord that includes the U.S. and much of Asia. But President Obama wasn<U+2019>t able to get TPP through Congress and Mr. Trump has promised to kill it. Mr. Guajardo said that Mexico will pursue the possibility of completing a smaller TPP with the countries that are expected to have ratified it by the end of 2016. He named Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. Australia would probably be eager to replace the U.S. as Mexico<U+2019>s chief food supplier. None of this would make up for the loss of U.S. market access under Nafta, which means that increasing Mexican competitiveness is urgent. Mr. Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto got historic constitutional reforms in energy and telecommunications through his Congress in 2013. Opening these markets to competition will attract capital and improve the infrastructure for producers but implementation takes time. Unfortunately the government<U+2019>s debt burden has increased sharply in recent years and taxes have gone up, adding to disappointing economic performance. These are mistakes that Mexican policy makers cannot afford if Mr. Trump plays chicken with Nafta. Write to O<U+2019>Grady@wsj.com.",

Andrew Cuomo. | AP Photo/Seth Wenig By Jimmy Vielkind 11/10/16 06:39 AM EST ALBANY <U+2014> His longtime friend Hillary Clinton was handed a stunning upset in her bid for the presidency. Republicans continue to control a majority in both houses of Congress. His efforts to help Democrats win the state Senate are sputtering toward failure. Yet Tuesday's results may have been just what Gov. Andrew Cuomo's career needed. Story Continued Below Clinton<U+2019>s unexpected defeat will hit the reset button within the national Democratic Party in a way that puts Cuomo, a self-styled centrist and populist Democrat, in the mix for 2020. And continued Republican control of the state Senate <U+2014> likely to be buttressed, again, by the chamber<U+2019>s Independent Democratic Conference <U+2014> keeps a system in place that has worked perfectly well for Cuomo during the last six years. <U+201C>He never had it so good,<U+201D> said Hank Sheinkopf, a political consultant who advised the governor<U+2019>s 2014 re-election bid. The governor himself was quiet between a 10:30 p.m. appearance outside Clinton<U+2019>s election night party on Tuesday night at the Javits Center and a 4:30 p.m. phone interview on Wednesday with the NY1 cable network. In a 10-minute exchange, Cuomo said his \"friend\" Clinton<U+2019>s loss made for an <U+201C>emotional day,<U+201D> but that he had already conducted a pleasant conversation with President-elect Donald Trump about his own plans to upgrade the state<U+2019>s transportation infrastructure. Lewis Dodley, the anchor, asked Cuomo about his role in the national Democratic firmament as it undergoes self-diagnostics and repairs. Cuomo<U+2019>s answer outlined the <U+201C>New York philosophy,<U+201D> which is that <U+201C>we believe in individual rights, but we believe in the collective.<U+201D> He then talked about his accomplishments over six years in office, including the legalization of same-sex marriage and increasing the minimum wage to $15 in many parts of the state. Asked if he would play a role in national party affairs, Cuomo replied: <U+201C>I see a role for myself as governor of the state of New York.<U+201D> Erie County Democratic chairman Jeremy Zellner had a more succinct answer when reached by phone on Wednesday: <U+201C>Absolutely.<U+201D> After years of gridlock and divided government in Washington, Zellner explained, Cuomo could offer a counternarrative. His basic political story involves reaching across the political aisle and getting big things done. <U+201C>People want government to work, and that<U+2019>s definitely a huge positive for our governor,<U+201D> Zellner said. <U+201C>I hope we can continue moving this state forward.<U+201D> While the final votes are still being tallied, the local result of the 2016 elections appear to be a state Senate that is still controlled by Republicans , probably in concert with the moderate IDC. Cuomo has worked well with the Republicans, and will have a much easier time threading a coming debate over state income tax policy if they are around to neutralize liberal, union-backed Democrats who dominate the state Assembly. Ostensibly, Cuomo<U+2019>s decision this cycle to raise money for Senate Democratic challengers and endorse select candidates was ideological. The governor said he had worked well with Republicans, but needed a Democratic Legislature to implement public campaign financing, extend tuition assistance programs to undocumented immigrants, raise the age of criminal responsibility and limit lawmakers<U+2019> outside income. Progressives have long dreamed of these policies, but considered Cuomo a fair weather ally at best. Leaders of the state<U+2019>s institutional left wing issued statements mourning the setbacks to these priorities. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s impossible to put a positive spin on last night<U+2019>s results,<U+201D> Citizen Action executive director Karen Scharff wrote in an email. <U+201C>I couldn<U+2019>t sleep last night, and woke up this morning heartbroken.<U+201D> But on Wednesday Cuomo said nothing. He is unlikely to have shed any tears when Zephyr Teachout, who challenged him from the left in 2014, lost her bid for a seat in Congress. Republicans, many of whom suspected this year was more about the governor<U+2019>s left flank than about a genuine ideological split, said they were ready to move along without any hard feelings. <U+201C>My thoughts are simply this: my relationship with Andrew Cuomo is not going to change one iota. I deal with him when I deal with him and his position knowing full well that the only consideration that he has on any issue is which way that issue is going to be assisting him politically at that moment,<U+201D> Senate deputy majority leader John DeFrancisco, a Republican from Syracuse, said. <U+201C>If you know that, you should be able to deal with that situation accordingly.<U+201D> Will Cuomo keep pushing his agenda? With an eye toward possible re-election in 2018 or a presidential campaign in 2020, Sheinkopf said it almost doesn<U+2019>t matter. Cuomo already has racked up bipartisan achievements, he explained, so issues that rally the Democratic base (but aren<U+2019>t enacted into law) are arguably more useful than additional achievements. <U+201C>Reaching across the aisle as a principle is a great thing, but blaming the opposition party for not working with you is also a great thing,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>He can have it both ways.<U+201D> There<U+2019>s also sufficient space between Cuomo and Clinton that he won<U+2019>t be damaged by her loss. The governor endorsed the former senator from New York and secretary of state immediately upon her entry into the race <U+2014> a move fueled by a desire to jump ahead of the governor<U+2019>s foe, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio <U+2014> and was a dutiful surrogate in the run-up to Clinton<U+2019>s April 19 primary win over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Cuomo, though, also flirted conspicuously with Vice President Joe Biden when he was considering a late-entry into the race. His efforts for Clinton, perhaps by bilateral agreement, were confined to the borders of the Empire State <U+2014> where her victory was assured. In August and early September, before revelations of Trump<U+2019>s misogyny that many thought would finish him, Cuomo held back from attacking him. Finally, in a trio of rallies on the final weekend of the campaign, Cuomo described Trump as <U+201C>un-New York<U+201D> for his stances on immigrants and women. All of this will no doubt be scrutinized by the party base in coming months and years. As will arguments over his role, or lack thereof, in the Bridgegate scandal and the federal and state corruption charges against members of his inner circle. But while a Clinton victory would have given Cuomo a place along the bar rail of Democratic politicians, her loss gives him a chance to do more than gaze at the top shelf. <U+201C>It gives different people new opportunities,<U+201D> said state Sen. Simcha Felder, a Democrat who caucuses with Republicans. <U+201C>No one would admit that, but I think they<U+2019>re very happy.<U+201D> A free synopsis of our Pro morning email about New York education policy and politics A free synopsis of our Pro morning email about New York energy policy and politics A free synopsis of our Pro morning email about New York health care policy and politics A free synopsis of our Pro morning email about New York real estate policy and politics Our morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on state news and politics A morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on city news and politics.

Moira Smith, 41 years old, said the justice touched her buttocks several times when they were seated together at his request at a dinner for Truman Foundation scholars in Falls Church, Va. Ms. Smith<U+2019>s allegations were first reported Thursday by the National Law Journal. A Supreme Court spokeswoman said Justice Thomas, 68, had no comment beyond a statement made to the publication. <U+201C>This claim is preposterous and it never happened,<U+201D> the justice said in that statement. The incident would have taken place eight years after he joined the Supreme Court and recalls a controversy that dogged the justice<U+2019>s Supreme Court 1991 confirmation, when a female aide, Anita Hill, testified that he had made inappropriate sexual remarks and propositions to her. Justice Thomas vigorously denied the allegations and was confirmed by a 52-48 vote. Ms. Smith posted an account of the incident on Facebook on Oct. 7, after hearing a 2005 <U+201C>Access Hollywood<U+201D> recording in which Donald Trump, now the Republican presidential nominee, lewdly spoke of grabbing and kissing women. Several women have subsequently made claims of inappropriate sexual behavior by Mr. Trump, which he has denied. The National Law Journal said it learned of the incident through the social media posting. The publication interviewed friends and former roommates of Ms. Smith, who told the publication that she complained of the incident after it occurred 17 years ago. In a statement Thursday, Ms. Smith said she was motivated to disclose the incident after seeing other women speak up about alleged assaults or inappropriate behavior by influential men. <U+201C>As the mother of a young daughter and son, I am coming forward to show that it is important to stand up for yourself and tell the truth,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>When Justice Thomas touched me inappropriately and without my consent, I was 23 years old<U+2014>and felt there was nothing I could do. Seventeen years later, it is clear that sexual harassment, misconduct and assault continue to be pervasive, having an impact on all women.<U+201D> Ms. Smith is general counsel of a public utility in Anchorage, the Enstar Natural Gas unit of AltaGas Ltd. , Calgary, Alberta, and is married to Jake Metcalfe, a former chairman of the Alaska Democratic Party. A 1997 Georgetown University graduate, she was awarded a Truman Scholarship through a foundation Congress established to benefit young people who demonstrate <U+201C>outstanding potential for and who plan to pursue a career in public service.<U+201D> She later received a law degree from the University of California, Berkeley. Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the conservative Judicial Crisis Network and a former Thomas law clerk, sought to defend Justice Thomas in a piece published online in the National Review on Thursday . <U+201C>The alleged conduct bears no resemblance to the man I worked closely with, whom I still count a friend after nearly 10 years,<U+201D> Ms. Severino wrote, adding she gave the allegations <U+201C>no credit whatsoever.<U+201D> Justice Thomas, the second African-American and among the most conservative jurists to serve on the Supreme Court since the 1930s, rose through Republican ranks as an aide to a GOP senator, an official in the Ronald Reagan administration and an appointee first to a federal appeals court and then the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush. Ms. Hill, a University of Oklahoma law professor who had been an aide to Justice Thomas when he was an Education Department official and then chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, testified 25 years ago at his Senate confirmation hearings. Four additional women made similar allegations but weren<U+2019>t called to testify, according to the book <U+201C>Strange Justice,<U+201D> an account of the confirmation battle by then Wall Street Journal reporters Jill Abramson and Jane Mayer.

Copper for December delivery closed down 0.6% at $2.5050 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices for the metal are up more than 19% from their October lows, driven by expectations of increased U.S. infrastructure spending under a new administration and a steadier economic outlook for China. China and the U.S. are the world<U+2019>s largest copper consumers, respectively. <U+201D>Prices ran ahead of themselves,<U+201D> said William Adams, head of Research at Fast Markets Ltd. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ll probably consolidate this week after the froth of last week.<U+201D> Looking ahead, he said news of appointments to President-elect Donald Trump<U+2019>s team could move the market as investors seek a clearer understanding of the likely direction of U.S. government policy. Meanwhile, Chinese foreign direct investment data due later Tuesday may shift views of the strength of demand from the world<U+2019>s key consumer of industrial metals.

According to NYPD sources, files found on Weiner<U+2019>s newly found laptop which he shared with his wife Huma Abedin, show evidence of a political pedophile ring operating within Washington, involving members of Congress as well as numerous top Clinton aides and insiders. According to reports , a folder on Weiner<U+2019>s laptop named <U+201C> life insurance <U+201D> contains explicit evidence that both Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin helped run and cover-up a Washington pedophile sex ring. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to: Money laundering Sex crimes with minors (children) Perjury Pay to play through Clinton Foundation Obstruction of justice Other felony crimes NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department<U+2019>s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices. <U+201C>What<U+2019>s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,<U+201D> the NYPD Chief said. <U+201C>There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.<U+201D> The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton. <U+201C>People are going to prison,<U+201D> he said. Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said. <U+201C>If they don<U+2019>t cooperate they are going to see long sentences,<U+201D> a federal law enforcement source said. NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop. The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high-ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too, sources said. Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiner<U+2019>s cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge. The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein<U+2019>s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries. Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein<U+2019>s guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island. source:",

Watch protester relives Trump fans<U+2019> attack at Nevada rally: \n<U+201C>I just went with sign that said <U+2018>Republicans Against Trump,'<U+201D> Crites told the Reno Gazette-Journa l . <U+201C>It<U+2019>s a sign that you can find online. I held up the sign and initially people around me were just booing me telling me to get out of there. Then a couple of these guys tried grabbing the sign out of my hands.<U+201D> He said he had no intentions other than to let his opinion be known. He expected to be booed and perhaps led away, but not pummeled nearly to death. \n<U+201C>Multiple people just tackled me down, kicking me choking me and just beating me up,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s when things even got crazier. I was on the ground and people were holding my arms, legs and I kept saying I can barely breathe. I was turning my neck just to get a little bit of air to keep from passing out.<U+201D> The police, he said, intervened just in time. \nAccording to the Guardian : The 33-year-old <U+2013> who says he has been a registered Republican for about six years <U+2013> said he was kicked, punched and choked, and feared for his life when the crowd turned on him at the gathering in Reno, Nevada . Crites cited Trump<U+2019>s treatment of Mexicans, Muslims and women as the reason he decided to protest again Trump, who he described as <U+201C>a textbook version of a dictator and a fascist<U+201D>. There were panicked scenes at the Trump rally, apparently prompted by shouts from at least one person in the crowd that the protester had a gun. Hundreds of people fled to the the back of the auditorium in panic as Trump was hurriedly rushed from the stage by his security detail. \nAs the following clip of the unfolding incident shows, Trump acknowledges someone in the crowd during his remarks, saying, <U+201C>Oh we have one of those guys from the Hillary Clinton campaign. How much are you being paid, $1,500?<U+201D> As the crowd begins to agitate and boo, Trump then says, <U+201C>Okay. Take him out.<U+201D> Just seconds later, as the scuffle appears to intensify, is when agents quickly approach Trump and take him off stage. Watch Donald Trump Rushed Off Stage by Secret Service: After Crites was removed from the event by security and police, Trump returned to the stage and told his supporters. <U+201C>No one said it would be easy.<U+201D> \nThough Republicans and Trump supporters on social media overnight were calling him a <U+201C>thug<U+201D><U+201C>infiltrator<U+201D> and <U+201C>Clinton shill,<U+201D> Crites posted a Facebook message (subsequently deleted) which said he has nothing official to do with the Clinton campaign, though he is supporting the Democratic candidate this year over Trump and has donated to her campaign. \n<U+201C>Take what happened to me tonight,<U+201D> Crites wrote to his fellow Republicans in the post, <U+201C>as a classic example of dictator incitement of violence <U+2014> against your own Republican brother with a stupid sign.<U+201D> This work by Common Dreams is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 International License.

Unlike other vote swapping schemes which pair a voter in a swing state with a voter in a <U+2018>safe<U+2019> state, a vote pact pairs voters across party lines who each promise to cast their ballots for a third-party candidate instead.   Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein, foreground, meets her supporters during a campaign stop at Humanist Hall in Oakland, Calif. on Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016. \nAUSTIN, Texas <U+2014> Third-party candidates are often accused of acting as <U+201C>spoilers<U+201D> by siphoning votes from the two major parties<U+2019> nominees and potentially tipping the balance in an election. \nPerhaps the most notable example of this is Ralph Nader. The former Green Party candidate is frequently accused of helping George W. Bush win the 2000 presidential election by diverting votes which otherwise would have gone to Democratic nominee Al Gore, although this theory has been disproven many times . \n<U+201C>A lot of people have basically grown to depend on the confines of the two-party system and have a hard time getting their brain around a constructive, strategic path out of it,<U+201D> Sam Husseini, a political activist, told MintPress News. \nHusseini proposed an alternative strategy in which voters form <U+201C>voting pacts<U+201D> across party lines. For example, a Democrat and a Republican might each agree to vote for a third-party candidate of their choice, rather than the two major parties<U+2019> candidates. The strategy reduces the potential for <U+201C>spoiling<U+201D> votes, as long as voting pacts don<U+2019>t cross state lines, because each of the major candidates loses voters equally. \nHusseini operates the website VotePact.org to encourage this method of vote sharing or vote pairing. Letter in Wash Post: <U+201C>VotePact Offers Voters a Sensible Alternative<U+201D> <U+2014> how #NeverTrump & #NeverHillary can pair up: https://t.co/HB3CtnGGdi \n<U+2014> votepact (@votepact) August 30, 2016 \n<U+201C>It has the potential for being a catalyst for genuine realignment and perhaps even for a victory for a so-called third party or independent candidate creative enough to use such a strategy,<U+201D> Husseini said. \nThird-party candidates frequently urge voters to follow their conscience rather opt for one of the <U+201C>lesser of two evils<U+201D> selected by the two-party system. As Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein frequently says , <U+201C>We need to stand up and fight for the greater good like our lives depend on it.<U+201D> \nHusseini said he<U+2019>d like to see third-party candidates embrace vote pacts instead of dismissing spoiler claims. He suggested they should also urge their supporters to form vote pacts as a way to safely support third-party movement building. Here<U+2019>s how Husseini imagines the idea being pitched by a candidate: <U+201C>There<U+2019>s a way out of this. You feel like you gotta vote for Clinton because you hate Trump. I get that. Lots of people are like that and lots of people are on the other side. Well, they should pair up and both vote for me.<U+201D> \nHe continued: <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve never seen any third-party candidate do that, which is why I think they<U+2019>re going to remain in single digits<U+201D> in the popular vote. \nOther forms of <U+201C>vote swapping<U+201D> have been proposed during this and previous elections, usually seeking to pair a voter from a swing state with a voter from a state <U+201C>red<U+201D> or <U+201C>blue<U+201D> state. The voter in the so-called <U+201C>safe state<U+201D> agrees to vote for a third-party candidate in return for securing a vote for their preferred candidate in a state where the election is in play. \nThis <U+201C>safe state<U+201D> strategy was especially popular in 2000, when voters sought to trade Nader and Gore votes. That election prompted a court case in which the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that that vote swapping is <U+201C>clearly protected by the First Amendment.<U+201D> \nLast month, Husseini told Bustle<U+2019>s Am<U+00E9>e Latour that the <U+201C>safe state<U+201D> strategy just <U+201C>kicks the can down the road.<U+201D> Third parties often hope to secure 5 percent of the popular vote in presidential races, which would unlock millions in additional federal funding for future elections, but Husseini thinks by embracing vote pacts they could potentially win elections outright. \n<U+201C>The other so-called <U+2018>strategies<U+2019> are basically a way of minimizing the so-called <U+2018>damage<U+2019> of third-party runs,<U+201D> he told MintPress. \nWhile Husseini said he hopes alternative candidates will someday make vote pacts a key part of their campaign strategy, he also stressed that it isn<U+2019>t too late for voters to embrace the idea in the 2016 election. Vote pacts require mutual trust between political opponents, so he recommends forming them with family members, close friends, and coworkers across party lines. \nHe also said voting pacts could spur political change by encouraging people to engage in challenging political conversations across party lines rather than simply shutting out opposing views. \n<U+201C>Instead unfriending that guy who said he might vote for Trump because he hates Clinton, reach out to them.<U+201D> Be Sociable, Share!",

And right now the Internet is buzzing with reports of voting machine problems in some of the most important swing states. In some areas officials were forced to make emergency switches to paper ballots due to voting machine issues, and in other cases voters that intended to vote for Donald Trump were having their votes registered for Hillary Clinton instead. The mainstream media is insisting that these are <U+201C>isolated instances<U+201D>, and hopefully that turns out to be true because the integrity of our elections is of the utmost importance. \nVoting machines are supposed to make voting easier and more efficient, but instead they are once again causing major headaches all over the country. The following summary of technical issues that we have seen so far comes from the New York Daily News <U+2026> \nIn Utah, voting machine problems in the southern part of the state forced poll workers to use paper ballots, with some residents sent to alternate voting locations. \nVoters in Colorado received provisional ballots after officials reported computer problems state-wide, though at least one county said that the state electoral system was back up Tuesday afternoon. \nMachine issues were reported in Wilson County, Tenn. <U+2014> and at one point all of the county<U+2019>s machines went down, according to local reports . Voting later resumed manually. \nIn Texas, a computer used by election clerks malfunctioned at a polling place, so officials briefly diverted voters to another polling place more than two miles away. \nIn Louisiana, some early voters were forced to wait as correct machines were installed. \nIn Durham County, N.C., paper poll books were being used Tuesday due to <U+201C>tech problems at a few sites.<U+201D> \nBut much more troubling is what has been happening in Pennsylvania. Numerous voters have been reporting that their votes were switched by the voting machines from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The following is an excerpt from one local news report <U+2026> \n<U+201C>Every time I would push a candidate for the Republican party, it would come up for the Democratic candidate,<U+201D> said voter David Drane. \nElection judges in Clinton Township, Butler County confirmed there were issues with two of their eight automated voting machines. Most of the issues came when people tried to vote straight party ticket. \nHowever, others said they specifically wanted to vote for Republican Donald Trump only to see their vote switched before their eyes to Democrat Hillary Clinton. \n<U+201C>I went back, pressed Trump again. Three times I did this, so then I called one of the women that were working the polls over. And she said you must be doing it wrong. She did it three times and it defaulted to Hillary every time,<U+201D> Bobbie Lee Hawranko said. \nAnd USA Today is reporting that vote switching is also being reported in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania<U+2026> \nAnd in one of the few glitches with political overtones, a problem with the calibration of electronic voting machines in Lebanon County, Pa., caused about a half dozen machines to display what voters thought were straight Republican tickets as straight Democratic tickets. Poll workers alerted the county elections bureau, and voters were able to change their ballots, said Michael Anderson, director of the Lebanon County Bureau of Elections. \nIf you recall, this exact same kind of thing happened in the all-important swing state of Ohio in 2012 . \nSo if Pennsylvania ends up being the difference in a Hillary Clinton victory, this will need to be looked at very, very closely. \nReports of vote switching in Pennsylvania are already getting so much attention that they are even making television news <U+2026> \nIn other parts of the state, a different type of problem has emerged. One African-American voter that tried to vote for Trump was extremely frustrated when the voting machine that he was using remained completely stuck on a selection for Hillary Clinton. This particular voter captured this on video and uploaded the video footage to Twitter <U+2026> this is what I was talking about, they fixed it but it was on some nut shit at first. pic.twitter.com/GO5Y9FCnYN \n<U+2014> <U+00E6>donis | hotep (@lordaedonis) November 8, 2016 \nVoter turnout is very heavy all over the nation, and it looks like we may shatter voter participation records all over the nation. \nSo that is a good thing. \nAnd we can get an idea of what voters are thinking by what they are searching for on the Internet <U+2026> \nWhen looking at searches of <U+201C>Who is ____ voting for,<U+201D> these names are the most popular: \nTaylor Swift",

The latest firing began on Friday and has continued to grow ever since. \nBoth sides are accusing the other, as usual, of starting the situation, and civilians living along the LoC are being evacuated in growing numbers. Since Friday at least 24 people have been killed in the firing , with the majority of them civilian bystanders. \nThis is the latest dust-up along the LoC since September, when militants attacked Indian forces within Kashmir and India responded with raids across the LoC, getting into fights with the Pakistani military on the other side. \nBoth sides say the latest firing from the other side was <U+201C>unprovoked,<U+201D> though in reality tensions have been boiling under the surface ever since the September incidents.

No endorsement of products and services advertised is either expressed or implied. \nThe Death Of John Kennedy By Michael Rivero\nThere have been two official investigations. One concluded Oswald acted alone, the other that there was a conspiracy. After half a century, many of the key documents which could tell the whole story remain classified. John F. Kennedy's brain is still missing from the National Archives. Why, if it is an open and shut case? Why the secrecy, if Oswald was just a \"crazed lone gunman\"? \nThe House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that John F. Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy based on the recording of the gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza, captured over a police radio. A total of 7 impulses were caught on the tape, but citing budgetary constraints, the HSCA only had 4 of them analyzed. The analysis concluded that all 4 were gunshots, two of them occurring within 1/2 a second of each other, too close to be fired by one man. Comparisons of the echoes with test shots fired in Dealey Plaza confirmed that at least one of the recorded shots had indeed been fired from the Grassy Knoll. Needless to say, the existence of 5, rather than just 3, gunshots destroyed the Oswald as lone gunman cover-up. Warren supporters quickly tried to dismiss the audio record of the gunshots by claiming that the recording was actually of gunshots in another part of the city, and confused for Dealey Plaza shots because of a timing error. Without explaining just where the other shots had occurred, or why the echo patterns exactly matched the test shots fired in Dealey Plaza, the Warren supporters declared victory. New research has shown that the report that dismissed the audio recording of the gunshots was itself deeply flawed, and ignored evidence that confirmed both the location and time of the recording as being in Dealey Plaza at the time of the JFK assassination. This means that the original House Select Committee on Assassinations conclusion is the correct one. There were at least five gunshots in Dealey Plaza, two of them within 1/2 second of each other, and at least one of the shots came from the Grassy Knoll. UPDATE: The Deathbed Confession of CIA Agent, E. Howard Hunt to his son on the JFK Assassination. UPDATE: Numerous witnesses had reported a large obvious exit wound in the back of Kennedy's head, consistent with the reports of a gunshot from the Grassy Knoll. The Warren Commission dismissed the exit wound and reports of a shooter on the Grassy Knoll and published in their report photographs of the back of Kennedy's head that showed no damage. Now it has been revealed that the Warren Commission did not publish the actual autopsy photos but substituted photos taken after morticians had reconstructed Kennedy's head an anticipation of a possible open casket viewing prior to the funeral , as had been done with Lincoln. \nAlthough described as a mix-up, the simplest explanation is deliberate deception by the Warren Commission. Dan Rather's \"fib\" \nDan Rather, at the time an unknown newscaster from a small market Texas TV station, viewed the Zapruder film, then described it to America on the CBS network. As this recording of that broadcast shows, Rather lied to all of America in claiming that the head shot pushed John F. Kennedy's head forward. \nRather makes the claim that Kennedy's head \"rocketed forward\" at 2:15 in the above video. He also makes a point of saying there were only three shots in total. Rather's meteoric rise to network status and stardom soon followed this broadcast. When the Zapruder film was finally shown publicly, during Jim Garrison's trial of CIA agent Clay Shaw, Rather's lie was revealed for all to see. A Revealing Wink \nMost Americans who lived through the Kennedy assassination are very familiar with the above photo of Vice President Lyndon Johnson being sworn in as President aboard Air Force One. \nBut very few people are aware of another photograph snapped just seconds later! \nIn this photo, Congressman Albert Thomas winks back at the brand-new President!",

The soundtrack was also processed with volume normalization, noise reduction, clipping reduction, and/or equalization (the resulting sound, though not perfect, is far less noisy than the original). \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30th_In<U+2026> ) \nThe 30th Infantry Division was a unit of the Army National Guard in World War I and World War II. It was nicknamed the <U+201C>Old Hickory<U+201D> division, in honor of President Andrew Jackson. The Germans nicknamed this division <U+201C>Roosevelt<U+2019>s SS.<U+201D>. The 30th Infantry Division was regarded by SLA Marshall as the number one infantry division in the European Theater of Operations (ETO), involved in 282 days of intense combat over a period from June 1944 through April 1945<U+2026> \nThe 30th Infantry Division arrived in England, 22 February 1944, and trained until June. It landed at Omaha Beach, Normandy, 11 June 1944, secured the Vire-et-Taute Canal, crossed the Vire River, 7 July, and, beginning on 25 July spearheaded the Saint-L<U+00F4> break-through of Operation Cobra. \nDuring Operation Cobra, on both 24 and 25 July, the 30th encountered a devastating friendly fire incident. As part of the effort to break out of the Normandy hedgerows, U.S. Army Air Force bombers from England were sent to carpet bomb a one by three mile corridor of the German defenses opposite the American line. However, Air Force planners, in complete disregard or lack of understanding of their role in supporting the ground attack, loaded the heavy B-24 Liberator and B-17 Flying Fortress bombers with 500-pound bombs, destroying roads and bridges and complicating movement through the corridor, instead of lighter 100-pound bombs intended as antipersonnel devices against German defenders. Air planners switched the approach of attack by 90 degrees without informing ground commanders, thus a landmark road to guide the bombers to the bombing zone was miscommunicated as the point to begin the bombing run. Start point confusion was further compounded by red smoke signals that suddenly blew in the wrong direction, and bombs began falling on the heads of the U.S. soldiers. There were over 100 friendly fire casualties over the two days, including Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, commander of Army Ground Forces. \nThe 30th relieved the 1st Infantry Division near Mortain on 6 August. The German drive to Avranches began shortly after. The 30th clashed with the elite 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, and fierce fighting in place with all available personnel broke out. The 30th frustrated enemy plans and broke the spearhead of the enemy assault in a violent struggle from 7<U+2013>12 August. After the liberation of Paris, the division drove east through Belgium, crossing the Meuse River at Vis<U+00E9> and Li<U+00E8>ge on 10 September. Elements of the division entered the Netherlands on 12 September, and Maastricht fell the next day. Moving into Germany and taking up positions along the Wurm River, the 30th launched its attack on the heavily defended city of Aachen on 2 October 1944, and succeeded in contacting the 1st Division on 16 October, resulting in the encirclement and takeover of Aachen<U+2026> \nAfter a rest period, the 30th eliminated an enemy salient northeast of Aachen on 16 November, pushed through Alsdorf to the Inde River on 28 November, and then moved to rest areas. On 17 December the division rushed south to the Malmedy-Stavelot area to help block the powerful enemy drive in the Battle of the Bulge<U+2026> Share this:",

To the extent that these issues have been mentioned, it has been on the candidates' terms, not on the networks' initiative.\" \nThese numbers are staggering in terms of the complete retreat they represent from issues-orientated campaign coverage. Just eight years ago, the last time both parties nominated new candidates for the White House, the network newscasts devoted 220 minutes to issues coverage, compared to only 32 minutes so far this year. ( CBS Evening News went from 119 minutes of issues coverage in 2008 to 16 this year.) - Advertisement - \nNote that during the Republican primary season alone, the networks spent 333 minutes focusing on Donald Trump. Yet for all of 2016, they have set aside just one-tenth of that for issue reporting. \nAnd look at this: Combined, the three network newscasts have slotted 100 minutes so far this year for reporting on Hillary Clinton's emails while she served as secretary of state, but just 32 minutes for all issues coverage . (NBC's Nightly News has spent 31 minutes on the emails this year; just eight minutes on issues.) \nIndeed, this approach used to be a hallmark of presidential campaign reporting; outline what candidates stand for, describe what their presidency might look like, and compare and contrast that platform with his or her opponents. i.e., What would the new president's top priorities be on the first day of his or her new administration? \nIt seems clear that the media's abandonment of issues coverage benefits Trump since his campaign has done very little to outline the candidate's core beliefs. Clinton, by contrast, has done the opposite.",

Bernie Sanders on Thursday attributed the Republican win to the failure of the liberal elite to represent working people. \n<U+201C>It is an embarrassment, I think, to the entire of [the] Democratic Party that millions of white working-class people decided to vote for Mr. Trump, which suggests that the Democratic message of standing up for working people no longer holds much sway among workers in this country,<U+201D> the progressive senator and one-time presidential candidate told the Associated Press . \n<U+201C>You cannot be a party which on one hand says we<U+2019>re in favor of working people, we<U+2019>re in favor of the needs of young people but we don<U+2019>t quite have the courage to take on Wall Street and the billionaire class,<U+201D> he continued. <U+201C>People do not believe that.

Now, it appears that unable to concede defeat, the man who aligned his career with Hillary Clinton, is going for blood, and is soliciting the help, but mostly money, of Clinton<U+2019>s top donors. \nAccording to Politico , Brock is launching his own Koch-brothers-like donor network to finance attacks on President-elect Donald Trump and to rebuild the political left after Trump<U+2019>s stunning victory over Clinton last week. In an email sent out on Thursday night, Brock emailed more than 200 of the biggest donors on the left, including finance titans George Soros, Tom Steyer and Donald Sussman all of whom invested millions of dollars in Clinton<U+2019>s campaign with nothing to show for it, inviting them to a private retreat in Palm Beach during inauguration weekend to assess what Democrats did wrong in 2016, figure out how to correct it and raise cash for those initiatives. \n<U+201C> This will be THE gathering for Democratic donors from across the country to hear from a broad and diverse group of leaders about the next steps for progressives under a Trump Administration ,<U+201D> Brock wrote to the donors in an email. <U+201C>What better way to spend inaugural weekend than talking about how to kick Donald Trump<U+2019>s ass?<U+201D> Brock said. The retreat, which is planned as the first in a series of regular gatherings, will feature appearances by an array of Democratic elected officials, operatives and liberal thinkers and group officials, Brock explained in an interview. \nWhile it is unclear how many of the addressed billionaires confirmed their presence at this <U+201C>secret<U+201D> gathering, Brock predicted there would be significant interest, noting that the keynote address at his last major donor conference, back in 2013, was delivered by former President Bill Clinton. It is unclear how much Clinton received for one hours of his time. \nBrock is a self-described <U+201C>right-wing hitman-turned-Clinton enforcer <U+201D> who has used his relationships with some of the left<U+2019>s wealthiet supporters and billionaire donors to build an armada of aggressive political outfits that have become pillars of the institutional left and that raised a combined $65 million during the 2016 cycle. As profiled previously, Brock<U+2019>s groups include the conservative media monitoring non-profit Media Matters, the opposition research super PAC American Bridge and the legal watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \nThat<U+2019>s not all: other groups in his network include the liberal media-funding vehicle American Independent Institute, the media-training non-profit Franklin Forum and the for-profit social media operation ShareBlue, which The New York Times described as <U+201C>Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s Outrage Machine.<U+201D> A seventh group, a super PAC called Correct the Record that was created to coordinate directly with Clinton<U+2019>s campaign , is winding down, though Brock said that a number of its functions and personnel likely will be absorbed by his other groups. \nAnd yet one wonders if Brock<U+2019>s attempt to square things up with Trump isn<U+2019>t too little, too late, especially for a many who like Huma Abedin, has been so closely associated with Hillary and her now defunct political career: Brock acknowledged in the interview: <U+201C>There is no question that we poured our heart and soul into this election for Hillary, but these institutions were built before her campaign and were intended to outlast it.<U+201D> \nTo separate himself from the Clintons whom he serves so well over the years, Brock said in his email to donors that he created Media Matters more than a decade ago to help the left push back during George W. Bush<U+2019>s presidency. \n<U+201C>In 2005, we were part of a successful progressive effort to regroup, retool and recover,<U+201D> he wrote. <U+201C>While today<U+2019>s situation is more dire, media matters more than ever.<U+201D> \nBut the biggest problem for Brock is that he is likely stepping on the very toes of those whose money he is after: as Politico notes, the Palm Beach retreat seems to be a challenge to the 12-year-old Democracy Alliance, a club of liberal financiers that was started by Soros and a handful of other major donors to fund the institutional left . In fact, the club, which held its annual winter meeting this week in Washington, helped launch Media Matters, and many of Brock<U+2019>s donors belong to its ranks. Brock said he<U+2019>s inviting the president of the DA, as the club is known, to his Palm Beach retreat. \nThere is one way Brock<U+2019>s network hopes to differentiate itself: while the Democracy Alliance at its winter meeting discussed ways to push back on the Trump administration, many of the group<U+2019>s members have tried to train its focus on pressuring Democrats from the left on issues like fighting climate change, money in politics and drug laws; Brock however is more overtly and aggressively political, and has been <U+201C>largely agnostic on the philosophical divisions with which Democrats are grappling.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>We don<U+2019>t think of this as representing a faction of the Democratic Party, but a cross-section of it, so we<U+2019>re not going to precook things ideologically,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>It is very politically minded, and there is an urgency to it.<U+201D> \nAt this point two questions emerge: one of the main reasons why Clinton lost is precisely due to behind the scenes scheming such as this, where political <U+201C>attack dog<U+201D> operatives would meet with billionaires and strategize how to shift public perception on any number of items. That has now been proven to be a losing strategy. Have the democrats truly not learned anything from their most shocking failure in history? \nThe next question is just how much more <U+201C>overtly and aggressively political<U+201D> will Brock, whose organizations have been alleged to be behind a number of the anti-Trump riots in recent months, be in his quest to take down, or rather <U+201C>kick the ass<U+201D> of Donald Trump. Because if there is one thing that is so far missing from the most scandalous political election in recent history, it is an attempt to physically eliminate the president. We can only hope that the <U+201C>hitman-turned-Clinton enforcer<U+201D> will not decide to go that far.",

Most of these are centered around the notion of telling people what to do and how to live their lives, with the aim of convincing people that conformity to church guidelines will bring some intangible reward in the afterlife.\n\n\nOne example of many is the Christian belief that the one and only way not to eternally burn in Hell is to accept Jesus Christ as the savior, as if no other deity or religious experience is valid to the human experience.\n\nThe concept of heaven and hell has been so ingrained into the human psyche that many people cannot see beyond this limiting paradigm to any other possibility. Retired Episcopal bishop John Shelby Spong , however, doesn<U+2019>t seem to believe in the myth of Hell, and during a nationally televised interview he shared his opinions on why he thinks convincing the flock to believe in the concept of <U+2018>Hell<U+2019> is absolutely critical to the Church<U+2019>s survival.\n<U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think Hell exists. I happen to believe in life after death, but I don<U+2019>t think it<U+2019>s got a thing to do with reward and punishment. Religion is always in the control business, and that<U+2019>s something people don<U+2019>t really understand. It<U+2019>s in a guilt-producing control business. And if you have Heaven as a place where you<U+2019>re rewarded for your goodness, and Hell is a place where you<U+2019>re punished for your evil, then you sort of have control of the population. And so they create this fiery place which has quite literally scared the Hell out of a lot of people, throughout Christian history. And it<U+2019>s part of a control tactic.<U+201D>  Many people turn to religious teachings for solace and guidance in life in our insane world, but, Bishop Spong seems to think religion helps people be less responsible for their own life and the world we live in, offering a unique perspective from the typical doctrines of Christian belief. <U+201C>The church doesn<U+2019>t like for people to grow up, because you can<U+2019>t control grown-ups. That<U+2019>s why we talk about being born again. When you<U+2019>re born again, you<U+2019>re still a child. People don<U+2019>t need to be born again. They need to grow up. They need to accept their responsibility for themselves and the world.<U+201D> No one can really confirm where human souls are bound after death, so why do religions create stories of places like Heaven and Hell? The answer is simple: to control people and keep the Church alive.\n\nIf even some of the most religious men, such as Bishop John Shelby Spong, are starting to publicly expose the motivations behind these stories, perhaps it is time for the masses to critically evaluate the value of religion over the importance of direct personal spiritual experience .\n<U+201C>Every church I know claims that <U+2018>we are the true church<U+2019> <U+2013> that they have some ultimate authority, <U+2018>We have the infallible Pope,<U+2019> <U+2018>We have the Bible.<U+2019><U+2026> The idea that the truth of God can be bound in any human system, by any human creed, by any human book, is almost beyond imagination for me. \nGod is not a Christian. God is not a Jew or a Muslim or a Hindi or Buddhist. All of those are human systems, which human beings have created to try to help us walk into the mystery of God. I honor my tradition. I walk through my tradition. But I don<U+2019>t think my tradition defines God. It only points me to God.<U+201D> WATCH THE  VIDEO: \n\n\nWaking Times SOURCE",

More than 500 militants and dozens of units of military vehicles were destroyed under fire from Russian and Syrian aircraft and Syrian troops.  \n\n\nAccording to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the bandits<U+2019> losses reach up to 260 killed. \nAs a result of the numerous defeats inflicted upon the Jaish al-Fath coalition in western Aleppo, government troops and their allies are preparing to switch their efforts to the southern districts of the Aleppo. \nLebanese Hezbollah is preparing a major special operation in the district of Khan-Tuman with the aim of ousting terrorists from positions along the Aleppo-Damscus M-5 highway. \nFollowing the retreat of the Jaish al-Fath gang, the Syrian army intends to exploit the fleeing and disorganized Islamists to regain control over a number of villages and commanding heights. \nAs reported earlier , on November 11th the Syrian army and its allies continued to advance in western Aleppo. After breaking through militants<U+2019> line of defense, they took the Minyan and Al-Assad districts<U+2026> \n\n\n\n\nFierce fighting is ongoing between militants and the SAA in the Al-Assad district with the use of heavy artillery and volley-fire rocket systems<U+2026> \nIn addition, the liquidation of the field commander of the 314th militant regiment, Osama Darwish, known as Abu Il Harman, during clashes with SAA units in the Al-Assad and Minyan districts has been reported. \n\n\n\n\nDuring clashes, Syrian troops managed to regain control over the southern triangle of the Al-Assad district and the Hamat Ad-Diyar and Al-Amal schools. \nRussian and Syrian air forces are launching strikes at militant headquarters and roaming gangs in the Rashidin 4, Khan al-Asal, Gabat al-Basil, Al-Mansura, Maskana, and Kashish airport districts. This has resulted in the elimination of dozens of armored vehicles and large numbers of militants. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, it has been repotred that groups involved in the Euphrates Shield operation, supported by Turkey, have announced the capture of the village of Talil north of the city of al-Bab northeast of Aleppo as a result of fighting against ISIS.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \n                                                   \n\n       Follow us on Twitter! \n                               \n\n             Donate! \n",

Devin Nunes asked James Comey <U+201C>how many incidents<U+201D> the FBI discovered where Hillary Clinton <U+201C>mishandled hard copy classified documents while overseas.<U+201D>  | AP Photo By Rachael Bade 10/31/16 05:55 PM EDT Updated 10/31/16 06:56 PM EDT In another new twist to Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s email controversy, a top House committee says it has reason to believe the former secretary of state left classified documents in a hotel room in China, according to a Monday letter. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, in the letter sent to FBI Director James Comey, asked several questions about the previously unreported incident, raising questions about whether the Democratic nominee had a habit of leaving behind sensitive material on her foreign travel. Story Continued Below <U+201C>I ... understand that former Secretary Clinton left classified documents in her hotel room in China and that U.S. Marine Corps security officials filed a report related to the possible compromise of the documents,<U+201D> Nunes writes. Nunes asked Comey <U+201C>how many incidents<U+201D> the FBI had discovered in which Clinton <U+201C>mishandled hard copy classified documents while overseas.<U+201D> He also inquired about the classification level of each incident. A committee spokesperson would not elaborate on where those allegations stem from nor offer proof of the issues raised. By Colin Wilhelm Clinton<U+2019>s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The State Department countered, however, that the document was not left in Clinton's hotel room, but in one of her staffers' during a May 2010 official trip. \"Upon Secretary Clinton<U+2019>s departure, a routine security sweep by Diplomatic Security agents identified classified documents in a staff member<U+2019>s suite. To be clear <U+2013> this was not Secretary Clinton<U+2019>s hotel room and no citation whatsoever was given to Secretary Clinton, nor were any reports written about Secretary Clinton<U+2019>s conduct,\" said State Department spokesperson John Kirby in a statement for this story. Kirby also said that, at the time of the security sweep, \"The suite was still inside of a Diplomatic Security-controlled area, and under the direct control of a Diplomatic Security agent posted outside the room.\" \"The documents were immediately secured and a security violation investigation was initiated by Diplomatic Security,\" he continued. While Diplomatic Security concluded that classified information had been improperly secured, \"the evidence did not support assigning culpability to any individual,\" Kirby said. They investgiation also found that \"the likelihood that the information was compromised was remote.\" The publicly released FBI file on its investigation into Clinton<U+2019>s private email server also depicted a similar incident happening in Russia. According to the documents, the Democratic nominee and her top aides allegedly left a classified briefing book in a hotel room in Russia. While Comey has said Clinton and her staff were <U+201C>extremely careless<U+201D> with classified materials, the FBI did not recommend prosecution against anyone when it wrapped up its investigation this past summer. The Nunes letter also followed Comey<U+2019>s recent announcement that the FBI is reviewing newly discovered evidence in the probe into Clinton's private email arrangement. Comey said the agency appears to have come across relevant emails on a laptop used by ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), who is under investigation for allegedly sending sexually explict messages with an underage girl. Weiner<U+2019>s estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is one of Clinton<U+2019>s closest staffers. The Battleground Project By Kyle Cheney and Katie Glueck Nunes<U+2019> letter asks how many emails the FBI discovered on Weiner<U+2019>s devices; the exact date they learned about the messages; and whether FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe recused himself from the email investigation. (McCabe recused himself from an FBI investigation involving Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton ally, because McAuliffe donated to his wife<U+2019>s campaign for state Senate. It is unclear whether McCabe did the same on other Clinton-related probes.) By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

Edward Herman is an exception, a genuine man of the Left. He says <U+201C>a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia.<U+201D> Clinton Is the Most Dangerous Person Alive <U+2013> An Interview with Edward S. Herman by Ann Garrison \n<U+201C> The election of Hillary Clinton might threaten a democratic order as much as a Trump victory.<U+201D> \nAnn Garrison: Earlier this year, you told me that you differ with Noam Chomsky, your co-author of Manufacturing Consent and other books, in that you plan to vote for the Green Party's presidential and vice presidential candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka in the swing state of Pennsylvania. Are you still planning to do so? \nEdward S. Herman: Yes. \nAG: Can you explain why? \nESH: Because the two duopoly candidates are dangerous to societal and international welfare and even survival. Hillary Clinton is a neo-liberal and pre-eminent war-monger. I think she is the most dangerous person living in the world today, given her highly likely election victory and her likely performance as president. She represents the corporate elite and military-industrial complex more clearly than Trump and she is a follow-on to Bush and Obama. She will pursue similar policies except for her somewhat more aggressive bent. \nTrump is a self-promoting windbag, racist and dangerous, unpredictable phony. We have a ghastly choice in these two. Jill Stein offers a protest opportunity, more so than not voting. On the line that either voting for Stein or not voting would constitute a vote for Trump, one might argue that a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia and a vote for Netanyahu (and hence for escalated violence in Palestine). \nAG: Hillary Clinton and John Podesta's e-mail has revealed that Hillary Clinton is well aware that the Saudi and Qatari rulers - not rogue elements - fund ISIS, and the same Saudi and Qatari rulers fund the Clinton Foundation. Throughout the last George Bush's presidency, there were innumerable headlines that \"Saudi oil sheikhs met with George Bush on his Crawford, Texas ranch.\" What are your thoughts on that? \nESH: Saudi Arabia is a US ally and an instrument of the warfare state. Hillary Clinton has treated its leaders warmly and she will continue to do so as president. The Clinton Foundation's receipt of money from Saudi and Qatari leaders is a first class conflict of interest and outrage, but the media have focused on the many less important abuses of Trump, helping cover over the outrages of their preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, Bill Clinton. \nAG: What do you think of Clinton's statement that she would make removing Bashar Al-Assad her top priority? And Trump's statement that he would not, because that would recklessly risk confrontation with Russia? \nESH: Hillary Clinton has essentially promised to escalate war in Syria and is therefore promising to go to war with Russia as well. Diana Johnstone has made the case that Hillary Clinton plans to try to bring about \"regime change\" in Russia (cite). This is of course incredibly dangerous and would have aroused a really democratic media, but the existing media are part of the war system, hence Hillary Clinton's commitment to wars is essentially suppressed. Trump has made a number of statements along the lines of reducing US interventions and commitments abroad and trying to deal with Russia in a less confrontational manner, but he has sometimes contradicted himself by urging expanded arms, use of nuclear weapons, etc. But Hillary Clinton has said nothing that would offset her war-mongering. This difference from Trump may help explain the intensity of media hostility to Trump. \nAG: Jill Stein has said that \"wars for oil are blowing back at us wth a vengeance\" and that she would cut the military budget by half, close most of the foreign bases, and redirect resources into a Green New Deal that would fully employ Americans building sustainable energy and agricultural infrastructure. I can't imagine you disagree, but do you think it's important for the Greens to articulate such a vision at the national and international level, instead of focusing solely on local races that they might win? \nESH: The Greens don't have the resources to compete in many local elections. So she is wise to focus on the big national and international issues. Furthermore, the real gap in the political system is the lack of opposition to national neoliberal and militaristic policies. It is said that she can't make a bigger mark given the hegemony of the duopoly, but even Ralph Nader couldn't get 5 percent of the vote. The system still works well, for the 1%. \nAG : Michael Moore has made a movie called \"Trumpland\" and warned that Trump's election would be the end of the United States , assuming that would be a bad thing. David Swanson, author of \"War Is a Lie,\" has imagined the same but argued, in \" Secession, Trump, and the Avoidability of Civil War ,\" that the break-up of the United States is not the worst possibility on the horizon. Do you have any thoughts on this? \nESH: Michael Moore is completely oblivious to the fact that the enlarging war that is likely to follow Hillary Clinton's election threatens not only a nuclear exchange but also attacks on civil liberties and the march toward fascism. In its own way, the election of Hillary Clinton might threaten a democratic order as much as a Trump victory. The anti-Trump hysteria has tended to block out consideration of the Hillary Clinton menace. \nAG: Is there anything else you'd like to say about why you're voting for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka? \nESH: I've always believed in the moral rule laid down in the categorical imperative: \"Do that which you would wish generalized.\" Ann Garrison an independent journalist based in Oakland, USA.",

He will die in his bed<U+2014>like Pinochet and Franco<U+2014>and totally escape justice. The American media can be counted on to eulogize him as a great and <U+201C>tough-minded statesman.<U+201D> Bet on it. <U+201C>The ICC move would mark the first time that a formal ICC investigation has scrutinized US actions and sets up a possible collision with Washington. Established by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on July 1, 2002, it<U+2019>s mandated to prosecute individuals for genocide and aggression, as well as crimes of war and against humanity. Instead, it functions solely as an imperial tool, supports powerful interests, targets independent states Washington and other Western nations oppose. It lets America, its NATO partners, Israel and their rogue allies get away with mass murder. .. Bosco cites unnamed sources, indicating chief ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda <U+201C>will seek to initiate an investigation in the coming weeks, likely after the US presidential election but before the end of the year<U+2026> US officials visited The Hague,<U+201D> letting her know who<U+2019>s boss. It<U+2019>s unclear where she intends to go. On October 7, 2001, US-led NATO forces attacked Afghanistan without just cause <U+2013> less than four weeks post-9/11, naked aggression planned months before that fateful day. .. Appalling war crimes followed, continuing daily. All post-WW II US wars were and continue being waged illegally against nonbelligerent countries reflecting over 70 years of unaccountability. No US government or military official ever faced charges for Nuremberg-level high crimes. It<U+2019>s irrelevant what Bensouda does or doesn<U+2019>t do. The 2002 American Service Members<U+2019> Protection Act (ASPA, aka The Hague Invasion Act) <U+201C>protect(s) United States military personnel and other elected and appointed officials of the United States government against criminal prosecution by an international court to which the United States is not party.<U+201D> .. CIA boss and notorious war criminal Richard Helms. This scoundrel died in 2002, so he definitely escaped justice. \nIt authorizes the president to use <U+201C>all means necessary and appropriate to bring about the release of any US or allied personnel being detained or imprisoned by, on behalf of, or at the request of the International Criminal Court.<U+201D> It prohibits the extradition of anyone from America to the ICC. In a November 2000 open letter, Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Zbigniew Brzezinki, former CIA director Richard Helms and other US signatories said Washington must put <U+201C>our nation<U+2019>s military personnel safely beyond the reach of an unaccountable international prosecutor operating under procedures inconsistent with our Constitution.<U+201D> .. Kissinger<U+2019>s high crimes are well-documented. Brzezinski got Jimmy Carter to sign a secret directive, authorizing aid for Mujahadeen fighters combating the pro-Soviet Russia government in Kabul, aiming to induce Moscow<U+2019>s military intervention which followed, what Brzezinski called <U+201C>the Afghan trap.<U+201D> .. Helms at CIA orchestrated Operation Phoenix in Vietnam, an assassination program claiming thousands of lives. Hillary Clinton, as junior New York Senator, supported the Hague Invasion Act. America and Israel, among other countries, failed to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. .. They remain unaccountable for the highest of high crimes. Expect Bensouda<U+2019>s investigation, if initiated, to accomplish nothing. Bosco admitted she<U+2019>ll <U+201C>be launching one of the most difficult investigations the court has undertaken, both practically and politically.<U+201D> No internal or external judicial body ever tried holding America accountable for decades of Nuremberg-level high crimes.

As analysts, traders, and bankers contemplate what the surprising victory by Donald J. Trump means for financial regulation, there appears to be agreement on the general direction: some Dodd-Frank rules on banking could be rolled back. That<U+00A0>helped bank stocks to rally sharply Wednesday<U+00A0>and early<U+00A0>Thursday. The KBW Nasdaq banking index closed at its highest level in more than a year Wednesday, and then rose another 2% this morning, giving it a 7% gain in a day and a half. Smaller regional banks are also rallying, led by names such as Zions Bancorp and Regions Financial . But many online lenders and other financial technology disrupters aren<U+2019>t participating in the rally. After the election results became known early<U+00A0>Wednesday, LendingClub Corp. shares have fallen about 2.3% through<U+00A0>Thursday<U+00A0>morning, while PayPal Holdings Inc. is down 2.8% and Square Inc. shares have dropped 4.4%. To be sure, Mr. Trump hasn<U+2019>t yet laid out specific aims for financial regulation. He has said in the past that he wants to <U+201C> get rid of Dodd-Frank ,<U+201D> specifically with the aim of getting banks to make more loans<U+2014>though he has at times also voiced support for the Volcker rule that bars banks from some forms of proprietary trading.<U+00A0>Plus, banks themselves may not be in favor of a total rollback, as they could see costs rise in the short term if rules change dramatically. But what<U+00A0>might all of this<U+00A0>mean for banks<U+2019> younger<U+00A0>rivals<U+00A0>in financial technology? The dozens of companies that have sprung up to challenge banks in lending, consumer banking, payments and other realms may suddenly find themselves competing with banks that feel unleashed, rather than hamstrung. Playing under a different, and in many ways smaller, set of rules<U+00A0>has been<U+00A0>helpful<U+00A0>for upstarts in recent years. Mobile banking startups have benefited from earning higher debit-card rates under Durbin Amendment rules than<U+00A0>large banks are allowed to. Online lenders using state licenses have been able to skirt community lending<U+00A0>requirements<U+00A0>and escape the<U+00A0>most stringent Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.<U+00A0>supervision. Cross-border payments startups have found ways to reduce the cost of anti-money-laundering checks by using transaction limits. Going into the election,<U+00A0>most fintech firms were hoping to get some kind of extension on the lucrative parts of banking<U+2014>such as the power to transmit money or export interest rates across state lines<U+2014>without<U+00A0>all of the same<U+00A0>regulatory requirements, in the form of some kind of limited banking charter . Others thought tech-first small banks, such as Cross River , would become their enabling partners and help them take on hobbled financial supermarkets. Now, with a Republican sweep, those dynamics could in theory reverse, with big banks also getting the ability to act more like fintech firms. Fintech firms may get additional powers under a new regime, too.<U+00A0>Even as<U+00A0>they work for<U+00A0>Dodd-Frank relief, industry-friendly regulators<U+00A0>and lawmakers also could find time to make it easier<U+00A0>for banks and fintech firms to<U+00A0>try new things under lighter oversight. And banks still aren<U+2019>t necessarily nimble when it comes to new technology. <U+201C>There is a possibility that removing Dodd-Frank would be harmful to non-bank fintech and allow banks to be more forward leaning,<U+201D> said Brian Knight, senior research fellow for the financial markets working group at George Mason University<U+2019>s Mercatus Center. <U+201C>However, banks also tend to be less innovation focused and still have higher legacy costs, absent and apart from regulation,<U+201D> he added. But if attention turns to broader relief for all of banking and financial services, there is certainly a higher risk that fintech could lose the<U+00A0>status<U+00A0>it has enjoyed as the locus of innovation and activity<U+2014>at least when it comes to being disruptive, rather than complementary, to traditional banks.

Story Continued Below The two seemingly impromptu exclamations from their campaign rallies served as an example of how far apart Trump and Clinton appear to be, less than a month from Election Day. Trump, trailing badly in the polls, is going negative by cheering on a massive hack that the Clinton campaign says comes courtesy of a group with ties to Russia; Clinton is attempting to portray herself as the candidate with a positive vision for working Americans while ignoring sensitive internal campaign information hacked from Podesta<U+2019>s email. On Tuesday, both candidates were set to campaign in the battleground state of Florida, a must-win for Trump to cross the 270 electoral vote threshold. But with just 28 days left to make their cases, geography seemed like the only thing the campaigns were jointly targeting <U+2014> Clinton and Trump seemed to be operating almost completely independently of each other. Clinton appeared with former Vice President Al Gore at Miami Dade College, so he could deliver a sobering, personal reminder <U+2014> not of the danger of Trump, but of how damaging third-party candidates can be. By Nolan D. McCaskill and Sarah Wheaton \"Your vote really, really, really counts,<U+201D> Gore said, making his first appearance on the campaign trail with Clinton. <U+201C>You can consider me Exhibit A of that truth.\" Since the 2000 election, Gore has retreated from politics and dedicated his life to fighting climate change. The sight of him standing behind a campaign podium was rare enough to briefly blanket cable news. His message was aimed at Floridians who might be disgusted with Trump but still considering a vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein or Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, who is currently polling at a not-insignificant 9 percent, according to a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Gore made no explicit reference to Ralph Nader, the green party candidate who many Democrats still blame for spoiling the 2000 presidential race for him. But he insisted over and over again, <U+201C>Take it from me: Every single vote counts.<U+201D> <U+201C>It was a very close election,<U+201D> Gore said, giving the very short version of what happened during the Florida recount of 16 years ago to millennial voters too young to remember the experience. But there were older voters in attendance who remembered. <U+201C>You won!<U+201D> the audience cheered. <U+201C>You were robbed!<U+201D> Clinton, for her part, spoke in detail about efforts to fight climate change, highlighting Philadelphia<U+2019>s <U+201C>green roofs, porous pavement, and some curbside gardens to help absorb storm water.<U+201D> But there was a cloud hanging over Clinton<U+2019>s rally <U+2014> the latest document dump from Podesta<U+2019>s hacked email account, which was released Tuesday morning. Those new emails revealed internal deliberations about campaign messaging; campaign staffing plans; references to lists of potential appointees in a Clinton administration offered by progressives like Elizabeth Warren; frustration with public officials like New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio; disagreement with Hillary Clinton about how to deal with her email server issue; grousing about donors and former State Department colleagues; and even the full text of an <U+201C>off the record<U+201D> interview Clinton conducted with The New York Times last July. By Bruce Ritchie Campaign officials realized the 5,200 emails that have come out so far were just the tip of the iceberg. Julian Assange's organization, Wikileaks, has hinted it has a stash of 50,000 emails that it will dribble out through Nov. 8. But at least on Tuesday, Trump appeared to be more interested in waging a war against his own party than focusing on the new information and potential weaknesses of the Democratic nominee. <U+201C>The very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!<U+201D> he tweeted Tuesday morning about the senator<U+2019>s response to a video that caught Trump bragging about his ability to get away with sexual assault. The GOP nominee called House Speaker Paul Ryan a <U+201C>weak and ineffective leader<U+201D> and railed that <U+201C>Disloyal R's are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary. They come at you from all sides. They don<U+2019>t know how to win - I will teach them!<U+201D> He promised that his war against those Republican leaders who have turned their backs on him was part of a new, nothing-to-lose strategy as he heads into the final stretch of the race down by a significant margin in the polls. <U+201C>It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off of me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,<U+201D> he tweeted Tuesday. Clinton was twice interrupted by protesters in Trump T-shirts who yelled that her husband, who is not running for president, was a rapist. But she ignored the outbursts and stayed on message, trying to get to the finish line while staying above the attacks and the hacks. \"I can't wait to have Al Gore advising me,\" she said, inclusively, of her onetime White House rival.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Ron Paul \n source: unz.com \n text: \nLast week<U+2019>s announcement of a record-breaking US aid package for Israel underscores how dangerously foolish and out-of-touch is our interventionist foreign policy. Over the next ten years, the US taxpayer will be forced to give Israel some $38 billion dollars in military aid. It is money we cannot afford going to a country that needs no assistance to maintain its status as the most powerful military in the Middle East. \nAll US foreign aid is immoral and counterproductive. As I have often said, it is money taken from poor people in the US and sent to rich people overseas. That is because US assistance money goes to foreign governments to hand out as they see fit. Often that assistance is stolen outright or it goes to the politically connected in the recipient country. \nJust as bad is the fact that much of what we call <U+201C>foreign aid<U+201D> is actually welfare for the wealthy here at home. The aid package to Israel is a very good example. According to the agreement, this $38 billion will all go to US weapons manufacturers. So the real beneficiaries are not the American people, and not even Israeli citizens. The real beneficiaries are the US military-industrial complex. Perhaps the money won<U+2019>t even leave Washington <U+2013> it may simply go across town, from the Fed to the Beltway bomb-makers. \nWhile even US government aid to desperately poor countries should be opposed on moral and practical grounds, it is even harder to understand US aid to relatively rich countries. At a nominal per capita GDP of over $35,000, Israel is richer than Japan, Italy, and South Korea. Not long ago Business Insider published a report by the Institute for the Study of War showing that the Israel is the most powerful military force in the Middle East. We know they have hundreds of nuclear weapons, a sophisticated air force, drones, and even nuclear weapons-equipped submarines. \nSo why is the US giving a rich and incredibly well-armed country a record amount of military aid? Part of it is that the US government believes it can coerce Israel to do Washington<U+2019>s bidding in the Middle East. History shows that this is a foolish pipe dream. If anything, US aid subsidizes Israeli human rights abuses in Gaza and elsewhere. \nAnother reason is a very powerful lobby in Washington, AIPAC, that pressures Members of Congress to focus on Israel<U+2019>s interests instead of US interests. Members of Congress should look at our economy, with effectively zero interest rates, an anemic non-recovery from the 2008 crash, historically low participation in the work force, and inflation eroding the value of the dollar and conclude that this might not be the best time to start handing out billions of dollars in foreign aid. Unfortunately most Members of Congress find it impossible to say no to special interest groups like AIPAC. \nHere<U+2019>s a better aid package for Israel: free trade, travel, friendly relations, and no entangling alliances. Israel should be free to pursue its national interests and we should be free to pursue ours. If individual Americans feel compelled to provide assistance to Israel or any other country or cause overseas they should be allowed. But the rest of us should not be forced to do so. Trade, not aid.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: zerohedge.com \n text: Oct 26, 2016 4:26 PM 0 SHARES \nThere was a sudden burst of confusion heading into today's Tesla earnings. As Bloomberg reported , a change in the way Tesla Motors Inc. will report quarterly results after today<U+2019>s market close has created a bit of a last-minute headache for analysts, with earnings estimates varying widely. The electric-car maker is phasing out most of the non-GAAP adjustments it<U+2019>s traditionally made, including ones for resale value guarantees or vehicles leased through banking partners. Starting today, when the company discusses third-quarter adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share, it plans to exclude only stock-based compensation. \nThe SEC in recent months has raised concern that public companies may be straying too far too often from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Though Tesla has telegraphed its plan for weeks, many analysts are only now revising forecast models and some are sitting out the guessing game entirely this time. That means it may be challenging to draw firm conclusions about whether Tesla missed or beat Wall Street expectations - giving added importance to what Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk says on a follow-up conference call about cash or production plans. \nSo heading into today's earnings, the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts stands at an adjusted loss of 54 cents a share, based on seven forecasts that have comparable methodologies that the firms say take the new practice into account. While all seven of those projected a loss, there are others who say the company may post a profit. \nWell, those who expected a profit got just that, because momnets ago Tesla not only reported revenue of $2.3 billion, far higher than the $1.9 billion expected, but also reported its first quarterly profit of $74 cents, smashing consensus estimate of a 54 cent loss. \nSince there will be much confusion over how these numbers make any sense, here is what the company said: \nStarting this quarter, our financial releases no longer include the non-GAAP revenue disclosures that we historically provided. To simplify our financial reporting, we add back non-cash stock-based compensation (SBC) to calculate non-GAAP results. Consistent with previous quarters, non-GAAP automotive gross margin will also exclude ZEV credit sales. \n\nTotal Q3 GAAP revenue was $2.30 billion, up 145% from Q3 2015, while total Q3 gross margin was 27.7%, compared to 21.6% in Q2. \n\nTotal automotive revenue was $2.15 billion on a GAAP basis, up 152% from Q3 2015. Our final Q3 delivery count was 24,821, over 300 more than the estimated delivery count we shared on October 2nd. Deliveries increased 114% from the third quarter of 2015, and was comprised of 16,047 Model S and 8,774 Model X vehicles. In addition, 5,065 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter. These vehicles will be delivered in Q4. \n\nOur Q3 GAAP net income was $22 million, or $0.14 per share on 157 million diluted shares, while our non-GAAP net income was $111 million, or $0.71 per share on a diluted basis, after adding back $90 million of SBC. Both figures include an $0.08 per share loss of other expense, net, primarily related to foreign currency transactions and the conversion of most of our 2018 convertible notes. \nConfused? So are we, and sadly charting the results does not help: \n\nAnd here are the company's GAAP revenues: \n\nAlas, even looking at the company's cash flow does not provide much apples to apples color. Here's why: \nWe hope that Elon Musk can provide some clarity on just what is going on here, because Wall Street has no idea. \n* * * \nGoing back to its core business, said that its final Q3 delivery count was 24,821, over 300 more than the estimated delivery count we shared on October 2nd. \" Deliveries increased 114% from the third quarter of 2015, and was comprised of 16,047 Model S and 8,774 Model X vehicles. In addition, 5,065 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter. These vehicles will be delivered in Q4.\" \nIt added the following: \nDuring the quarter, we opened 17 new stores and service centers to increase our customer support network to 250 locations globally. We believe new product variants such as the P100DL, additional Model X seating variants, new product capabilities such as Enhanced Autopilot and hardware for Full Self-Driving Capability, Autopilot 8.0 software, and new store and service center openings should continue to drive strong vehicle order growth. \nThe company also said that it had \"achieved record production levels in Q3, rising to 25,185 vehicles for an increase of 37% from Q2 and an increase of 92% from Q3 last year\" \nTSLA said 4Q deliveries were <U+201C>just over<U+201D> 25k, had 3Q deliveries of 24.5k, forecast 2H deliveries of 50k. The company also said that the Model 3 remains on plan for volume deliveries in second half of 2017. Here is the full outlook: \nWe maintain our guidance of 50,000 new vehicle deliveries for the second half of 2016, with a Q4 plan of just over 25,000 deliveries, despite the challenges of winter weather and the holiday season. We expect about 30% to 35% of these deliveries to be accounted for as leases for revenue recognition purposes. \n\nAs previously provided in our second quarter update, we guided a 2 to 3 percentage points improvement in automotive gross margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis by the end of 2016. Automotive gross margin on a non-GAAP basis excludes ZEV credits and SBC. We are on track to meet this guidance. \n\nWe also guided in our second quarter update that full year 2016 operating expenses, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, would grow approximately 30% from 2015. We are also on track to meet this guidance. \n\nWe now expect our capital expenditures in 2016 will be approximately $1.8 billion as we continue to focus on capital efficiency. Capital expenditures for the past three quarters totaled $759 million. \nWhile an apples-to-apples analysis is clearly missing the report, for now the algos love the headline, and have sent the stock surging after hours.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Russell Gold \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-may-give-trump-energy-goals-a-boost-1480338003 \n text: Donald Trump says he plans to make America energy-independent.<U+00A0>He may receive an unintended boost<U+00A0>this week in the form of an oil production cut by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which could raise crude prices. Mr. Trump has pledged to slash regulations he sees as impediments to U.S. fossil-fuel industries. But, the U.S. has moved closer to energy independence in recent years. Oil imports are down and exports of natural gas and diesel are up. Overall, the net amount of energy brought into the country fell to 11.2% of domestic need in 2015 from 30.1% in 2006, according to Gregor Macdonald, an independent energy analyst. Energy experts say the biggest barrier to additional increased domestic oil production today is the low price of crude, not red tape. While the President-elect has certain extraordinary levers he could try to use to raise oil prices<U+2014>including restricting imports of crude from countries such as Saudi Arabia<U+2014>the actions could prove politically controversial, and likely to drive up prices at the pump, something politicians are historically loath to do. However, OPEC, which declined to curtail its output to put a floor on prices two years ago, is now trying to reach an agreement this week in Vienna to cut production as a way to address a continuing imbalance between supply and demand. That may be a boon for Mr. Trump and U.S. oil and gas producers, who helped create the global glut by using advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to unlock new supplies. Oil companies would be able to clean up damaged balance sheets, and increase the pace of drilling, if an OPEC production cut leads global prices to tick up over $50 a barrel and stabilize. In a YouTube video last week detailing his plans for his first 100 days in office, Mr. Trump promised to roll back regulations on energy. <U+201C>I will cancel job-killing restrictions on the production of American energy, including shale energy and clean coal, creating many millions of high-paying jobs,<U+201D> he said. While industry officials applaud such measures,<U+00A0>many say they need higher prices to kick production into another gear. <U+201C>To get the full blown benefit of all the reserves out there, you need a higher and stable price,<U+201D> says Lee Fuller, executive vice president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. Although total energy independence may be difficult, if not impossible, for the U.S. to achieve, the country is closer to that goal today than it has ever been since the early 1970s. In August 2008, the U.S. produced five million barrels a day of crude oil.<U+00A0>Eight years later, production was at 8.7 million barrels, according to the latest monthly tally from the Energy Information Administration. That is down from a peak of 9.6 million barrels daily in April 2015, as domestic oil production has fallen in recent months and imports have risen because lower global oil prices led U.S. producers to idle drilling rigs and cut production budgets. Still,<U+00A0>the strength of American oil production gives Mr. Trump more room to maneuver, and more ability to adopt a foreign policy that challenges Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC. The U.S. boom <U+201C>offers a grand opportunity to strengthen our ties with<U+00A0>our<U+00A0>allies and friends and gives us commercial leverage,<U+201D> said Kathleen Harnett White, a former environmental regulator in Texas who is now a policy fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Austin. Mr. Trump and his advisers have railed against OPEC. <U+201C>He is operating from this widespread view, formed in the 1970s, that OPEC is manipulating the price of oil to the detriment of the U.S.,<U+201D> says<U+00A0>Robert McNally, president of energy-advisory firm the<U+00A0>Rapidan Group<U+00A0>and a former<U+00A0>National Security Council adviser for energy under President George W. Bush. Many people close to the incoming president view Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, with distrust.<U+00A0>One of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s key energy advisers is Harold Hamm, the chairman and chief executive of Continental Resources Inc. Mr. Trump has praised him as an <U+201C>amazing friend<U+201D> and a valuable guide on energy issues. In an interview earlier in November following Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election, Mr. Hamm suggested a new relationship with America<U+2019>s overseas oil suppliers. <U+201C>Some of the countries, Saudi Arabia in particular, have been treated too kindly, because of the large supply of oil,<U+201D> Mr. Hamm said. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think that may be the case in the future.<U+201D> Nonetheless, a coordinated agreement by OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, to tighten supplies to oversupplied oil markets could provide<U+00A0>a windfall for independent oil and gas producers such as Mr. Hamm, and<U+00A0>generate momentum for Mr. Trump<U+2019>s energy-independence plans. There is no question that the U.S. has the capacity to ramp up production, if prices support it. There is a sea of oil, in particular,<U+00A0>in West Texas<U+2019> Permian Basin. The U.S. Geological Survey recently estimated<U+00A0>that the<U+00A0>area<U+2019>s<U+00A0>Wolfcamp Shale held 20 billion barrels of oil. That is three times the size of the Bakken Shale in North Dakota, and the largest continuous oil accumulation ever assessed in the U.S. At present, operators in the Permian Basin produce about two million barrels a day. Bud Brigham, founder of Brigham Resources LLC, said production could double or triple within a few years. <U+201C>It has legs and it has depth,<U+201D> he said. If that were to happen, the U.S. would tilt even further from being an importer to an exporter nation. In 2008, U.S. oilmen such as Mr. Brigham were just beginning to figure out how to apply hydraulic fracturing technology to the Bakken Shale, the first steps in what has turned into a domestic oil renaissance in the U.S. Now the limitations are more economic than technological.

The Australian tradition of backyard cricket has gotten much more competitive in recent years. PHOTO: Supplied. \n<U+201C>Warnie always said one brings two<U+2026> In this case I went further,<U+201D> he said. \nThe full-time landscaper took the wickets of his three kids (aged 5, 8 & 13) as well as his wife (32) and two kids from down the street (ages unknown). \n<U+201C>I was a pretty talented junior but my best was only three or four for,<U+201D> he said. \nRichards claimed the scalps in just four overs on his 16-meter backyard pitch aided by generous electric wickie rules and the controversial one-hand-one-bounce law. Richards vehemently denies that he tampered with the ball, despite half of it being covered in a mysterious tape for the duration of the match. PHOTO: Supplied. \nHowever, video has emerged of Richards allegedly tampering with the ball with what seems like red electrical tape. \n<U+201C>The tape was already on the ball before we started playing. That<U+2019>s well within the rules,<U+201D> he said. \nNeighbours described his spell as <U+201C>frightening and intense<U+201D> but added numerous dismissals were through the six-and-out by-law. \nIn addition to his economical and wicket-to-wicket line-and-length bowling style, Richards also used an impressive array of sledges and other psychological tactics to get under the skin of the opposition team. \nHis daughter Kayla explains. \n<U+201C>Dad would dip one in short and I<U+2019>d have to dive out-of-the-way,<U+201D> she said. \n<U+201C>Every time I tried to dodge the short balls, he<U+2019>d call me a poofter, which doesn<U+2019>t make any sense to me,<U+201D> \nDespite the criticism levelled against him, Richards has lashed out at his detractors. \n<U+201C>You don<U+2019>t hear Johno (Mitchell Johnson) whinge about how he takes <U+2019>em<U+201D> the one-time 3rd grader said. \n<U+201C>I<U+2019>m already growing the mo<U+2019> so I can steam in with him when The Ashes start.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>I played it smart. Me boy Jacob (aged 8 ) Is a pretty timid kid. I knew after knocking over Darcy (aged 5) with a full toss that he would be pretty nervous at the crease.

According to a late-night report, The White House is taking drastic action in light of the FBI<U+2019>s reopening of Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s email investigation. The Obama Administration has stated that they had not prior knowledge of the new investigation. It is also being reported that The Department of Justice was not notified, either. Some theorize that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is working to regain its reputation as an organization of integrity. By choosing not to inform The White House or The Department of Justice, the FBI could have been trying to prevent intervention from these two powerhouses. Now, the public knows that the investigation has been restarted, and it will be harder for pro-Hillary government organizations to play politics with the issue. The FBI<U+2019>s stunning news has caused The White House to take action, according to a recent report from Redflagnews . Late Friday night, all of Barack Obama<U+2019>s scheduled campaign appearances on behalf of Hillary Clinton were CANCELLED! Reportedly, all of the pre-planned events have been removed from the schedule (see below.) Given that President Obama<U+2019>s approval ratings are at an all-time high, a mass cancellation of this nature is certainly devastating to a Democrat Presidential hopeful like Hillary Clinton. For a popular, two-term President to distance himself from a Campaign, during the final ten days of the Election, is earth-shattering. Take a look at the following graphic: Will the Hillary Clinton Campaign have time to recover from these shocking revelations? Unfortunately, for Hillary, this may not be the last shoe to drop. Julian Assange of WikiLeaks has said that his next release will be the one that will definitely incriminate Hillary. Additionally, group like Anonymous are hinting that they also have blockbuster information to be released soon. Has the <U+201C>October Surprise<U+201D> been replaced by the <U+201C>November Surprise?<U+201D> It appears that Hillary Clinton is about to find out. Related Items",

Consider the floodgates now closed. Story Continued Below The multiple accusations of sexual misconduct leveled against Donald Trump reported during the past 24 hours haven<U+2019>t prompted more elected Republicans to pull the plug <U+2014> and none are expected to do so, according to operatives working on Senate races. After standing by Trump through all this, it<U+2019>s hard to imagine what, at this point, it would take to change their minds. <U+201C>Asked and answered,<U+201D> Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said Thursday when questioned about the new allegations against Trump. Though Blunt has denounced Trump<U+2019>s actions, he<U+2019>s still supporting him. <U+201C>And the answer<U+2019>s still the same.<U+201D> Other Senate Republican candidates were right there with him. \"I<U+2019>m not going to defend Donald Trump or what he said,\" Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said during a North Carolina Senate debate Thursday night. \"But when I look at our choice, it<U+2019>s not close for me. I<U+2019>m going to support my nominee. I<U+2019>m going to support Donald Trump.\" Campaign aides for Todd Young in Indiana and Marco Rubio in Florida had no comment Thursday on whether they would withdraw their support for Trump in light of the new allegations. And no other prominent Republican official yanked his or her support of the nominee in light of the accusations on Thursday <U+2014> a far cry from the stampede days earlier. By Louis Nelson <U+201C>Ron has said Mr. Trump<U+2019>s comments were indefensible <U+2014> and it<U+2019>s up to Mr. Trump to address these allegations himself,<U+201D> said Brian Reisinger, a campaign spokesman for Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who has stood by his support of Trump. The new allegations gave Democratic candidates fresh ammunition to tie their Republican opponents to Trump, who remained defiant in the face of the accusations on Thursday. He threatened to sue The New York Times, which published accounts of two of the women on Wednesday night. <U+201C>Sen. Pat Toomey now has the distinction of [being] the only Senate candidate in the entire United States of America to refuse to come clean about whether or not he supports Donald Trump,<U+201D> Katie McGinty, the Democratic candidate in the Pennsylvania Senate race, told reporters on Thursday. <U+201C>The only person asking to be elected United States senator refusing to answer this very basic question.<U+201D> McGinty added: <U+201C>I guess, is Sen. Toomey saying he doesn<U+2019>t believe these women?<U+201D> A campaign spokesman for Toomey, who has refused to answer whether he supports Trump or not, did not return a request for comment on McGinty<U+2019>s remarks. But in a radio interview Thursday morning, the Republican incumbent continued to straddle his own blurry line when it comes to the presidential race. Sen. Pat Toomey continues to play on coy whether he supports Donald Trump as the Republican nominee.  | AP Photo <U+201C>If Donald Trump becomes president, he can<U+2019>t accomplish anything if Chuck Schumer<U+2019>s in charge of the Senate,<U+201D> Toomey told conservative radio host Chris Stigall. <U+201C>And if Hillary Clinton becomes president, you want to have a check on what could otherwise be a really, really radical administration. Either way, I think it makes an awful lot of sense to have Republicans in control of the Senate.<U+201D> He accused McGinty of being a <U+201C>rubber stamp<U+201D> for Hillary Clinton, while stressing that voters want a Republican Senate no matter who occupies the White House. It<U+2019>s clear why Trump loyalists in the Senate are sticking with him: They no doubt witnessed the fierce blowback from the conservative base against some of their colleagues who rescinded their support last weekend. Nevada Republican candidate Joe Heck was booed at a rally as he announced he would no longer back Trump because of his remarks in the video. At the same time, some early polling data suggests the damage to those who turned against Trump might be minimal. <U+201C>Don<U+2019>t think it has any appreciable effect down-ballot,<U+201D> said one GOP strategist on Senate races Thursday of the Trump controversies. <U+201C>At this point, I<U+2019>m not even sure it impacts Trump all that much.<U+201D> Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who's been trouncing Democrat Ted Strickland in polls for months now, is still riding high after his Trump un-endorsement. Strickland and the Ohio Democrats have been trying to promote anecdotes about tea party voters who say Portman has lost their support. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll conducted after the Trump tape fallout and released Thursday showed Portman leading Strickland by 18 points. The same survey found Burr and Democratic challenger Deborah Ross tied at 46 percent among likely voters, in line with previous polling that show a tight race in the Tar Heel State. In Nevada, a poll commissioned by the GOP super PAC Senate Leadership Fund found Heck leading Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto by 3 points, even as Trump is down by 6 points in a three-way presidential ballot. (On Wednesday, a poll from Public Policy Polling conducted for the Cortez Masto campaign showed a different outlook, with the Democrat at 43 percent and Heck at 39 percent.) 2016 By Ben Schreckinger <U+201C>There is no evidence that Heck announcing he could no longer support Trump is hurting him with Trump<U+2019>s voters,\" Republican pollsters Glen Bolger and Jim Hobart wrote in a memo on the SLF poll. Seven-in-10 respondents said Heck's un-endorsement made no difference to them. <U+201C>I know it<U+2019>s going to make a lot of people uncomfortable, and I<U+2019>ve had a couple of people approach me and tell me they were disappointed in the decision that he made,<U+201D> Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said of Heck<U+2019>s move in an interview Thursday. But <U+201C>I think he did the right thing, and frankly, I think he<U+2019>s going to be fine because of it.<U+201D> Another reason why Republicans may be frozen in place in terms of their endorsement: Those who waffled on their support for Trump <U+2014> calling on him to step aside, and then saying they would vote for him after all <U+2014> were roundly criticized, even by fellow Republicans. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t get it. I have to tell you, I don<U+2019>t get it,<U+201D> Heller said. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s very painful for me to watch these candidates move back and forth, and colleagues move back and forth, on where they are with Trump. I<U+2019>m in the same place I<U+2019>ve always been. I continue to stay here.<U+201D> Maggie Severns contributed to this report from St. Charles, Missouri.

That <U+2018>declaration<U+2019> was the first ever explicit commitment made by Britain, and the West in general, to establish a Jewish homeland atop an existing Palestinian homeland.\nIt is too early to tell whether the Arab League would heed the Palestinian call , or if the PA would even follow through, especially considering that the latter has the habit of making too many proclamations backed by little or no action.\nHowever, it seems that the next year will witness a significant tug of war regarding the Balfour Declaration, the 100th anniversary of which will be commemorated on November 02, 2017 .\nBut who is Balfour, what is the Balfour Declaration and why does all of this matters today?\nBritain's Foreign Secretary from late 1916, Arthur James Balfour, had pledged Palestine to another people. That promise was made on November 02, 1917 on behalf of the British government in the form of a letter sent to the leader of the Jewish community in Britain, Walter Rothschild.\nMORE... Palestine<U+2019>s reality: Al Nakba commemoration and the right of return or the return of the Faisal-Weizmann Agreement? To be a child in Palestine, where Israel has killed more children than the total number of goals scored in all FIFA World Cups Let There Be Water: Israel's policy of stolen water No hope and no heroes for Palestine At the time, Britain was not even in control of Palestine, which was still part of the Ottoman Empire. Either way, Palestine was never Balfour<U+2019>s to so casually transfer to anyone else. His letter read:\n<U+201C>His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.<U+201D>\nHe concluded, <U+201C>I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation.<U+201D>\nBalfour was hardly acting on his own. True, the Declaration bears his name, yet, in reality, he was a loyal agent of an Empire with massive geopolitical designs, not only concerning Palestine alone, but with Palestine as part of a larger Arab landscape.\nOnly a year earlier, another sinister document was introduced, albeit secretly. It was endorsed by another top British diplomat, Mark Sykes and, on behalf of France, by Fran<U+00E7>ois Georges-Picot. The Russians were informed of the agreement, as they too had received a piece of the Ottoman cake.\nThe document indicated that, once the Ottomans were soundly defeated, their territories, including Palestine, would be split among the prospective victorious parties.\nThe Sykes-Picot Agreement , also known as the <U+2018>Asia Minor Agreement<U+2019>, was signed in secret one hundred years ago, two years into World War I. It signified the brutal nature of colonial powers that rarely associated land and resources with people who lived upon or owned them.\nThe centerpiece of the agreement was a map that was marked with straight lines by a China graph pencil. The map largely determined the fate of the Arabs, dividing them in accordance with various haphazard assumptions of tribal and sectarian lines.\nThe improvised map consisted not only of lines but also colors , along with language that attested to the fact that the two countries viewed the Arab region purely on materialistic terms, without paying the slightest attention to the possible repercussions of slicing up entire civilizations with a multifarious history of co-operation and conflict.\nThe Sykes-Picot negotiations were completed in March 1916 and, although official, was secretly signed on May 19, 1916.\nWWI concluded on November 11, 1918, after which the division of the Ottoman Empire began in earnest.\nBritish and French mandates were extended over divided Arab entities, while Palestine was granted to the Zionist movement a year later, when Belfour conveyed the British government<U+2019>s promise, sealing the fate of Palestinians to a life of perpetual war and turmoil.\nRarely was British-Western hypocrisy and complete disregard for the national aspiration of any other nation on full display as in the case of Palestine. Beginning with the first wave of Zionist Jewish migration to Palestine in 1882, European countries helped facilitate the movement of illegal settlers and resources, where the establishment of many colonies, large and small, was afoot.\nSo when Balfour sent his letter to Rothschild, the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine was very much plausible.\nStill, many supercilious promises were being made to the Arabs during the Great War years, as the Arab leadership sided with the British in their war against the Ottoman Empire. Arabs were promised instant independence, including that of the Palestinians.\nWhen the intentions of the British and their rapport with the Zionists became too apparent, Palestinians rebelled , marking a rebellion that has never ceased 99 years later, and highlighting the horrific consequences of British colonialism and the eventual complete Zionist takeover of Palestine which is still felt after all of these years.\nPaltry attempts to pacify Palestinian anger were to no avail, especially after the League of Nations Council in July 1922 approved the terms of the British Mandate over Palestine <U+2013> which was originally granted to Britain in April 1920 <U+2013> without consulting the Palestinians at all. In fact, Palestinians would disappear from the British and international radar, only to reappear as negligible rioters, troublemakers, and obstacles to the joint British-Zionist colonial concoctions.\nDespite occasional assurances to the contrary, the British intention of ensuring the establishment of an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine was becoming clearer with time. The Balfour Declaration was not merely an aberration, but had, indeed, set the stage for the full-scale ethnic cleansing that followed, three decades later.\nIn fact, that history remains in constant replay: the Zionists claimed Palestine and renamed it <U+2018>Israel<U+2019>; the British continue to support them, although never ceasing to pay lip-service to the Arabs; and the Palestinian people remain a nation that is geographically fragmented between refugee camps, in the diaspora, militarily occupied, or treated as second class citizens in a country upon which their ancestors dwelt since time immemorial.\nWhile Balfour cannot be blamed for all the misfortunates that have befallen Palestinians since he communicated his brief, but infamous letter, the notion that his <U+2018>promise<U+2019> embodied - that of complete disregard of the aspirations and rights of the Palestinian Arab people <U+2013> that very letter is handed from one generation of British diplomats to the next, in the same way that Palestinian resistance to colonialism has and continues to spread across generations.\nThat injustice continues, thus the perpetuation of the conflict. What the British, the early Zionists, the Americans and subsequent Israeli governments failed to understand, and continue to ignore at their own peril, is that there can be no peace without justice and equality in Palestine; and that Palestinians will continue to resist, as long as the reasons that inspired their rebellion nearly a century ago, remain in place.",

The supersaturation of these kinds of moments is such that the phrase might well be over and tired by tomorrow at noon. But then again, it might stick around, because of how well it suits, and reframes, the brand that is Hillary Clinton. It was the insult of her dreams: a rallying cry with more heat and emotion than any her campaign has generated in lo these many years. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m With Her<U+201D> always risked sounding as if it was more about Clinton, as female candidate, than the person saying it. The women who are laying claim to being <U+201C>nasty women,<U+201D> by contrast, are not just announcing their support for Clinton. They are also identifying with an anger that she has rarely shown but they can imagine she feels. To describe yourself, with glee, as a nasty woman is a powerful unleashing, a refutation of all that girls are brought up to be: subservient, silent and accommodating, to the point of personal risk. Clinton<U+2019>s own careful control of her emotions has, of course, cost her. The public has sensed the effort that goes into her appearances, the careful titration of her comebacks for fear of appearing witchy or harsh or emasculating. And yet in trying to punish her for her more overt displays of hostility, with one interruption, Trump instantly turned harshness <U+2014> fierceness <U+2014> into a celebrated badge of honor. At the debate, Clinton did seem to let loose a tougher, less insistently congenial version of herself than what she typically allows; even on the subject of late-term abortions, about which she has fallen over herself qualifying her commitment in the past, she did not back off. She spoke, passionately and with authority, about women in China and in Romania who did not have control over their reproductive rights. That moment, in its delivery and conviction, was a remarkable echo of comments Clinton made in 2009 when, as secretary of state, she offered up testimony before the House that went viral . Asked whether she and President Obama were working to overturn anti-abortion laws overseas, and whether reproductive rights included abortion, Clinton responded with unapologetic frankness, testifying about women she saw in Brazil who were <U+201C>fighting for their lives against botched abortions,<U+201D> and girls as young as 12 in Africa bearing children, before concluding that yes, the administration would advocate abortion rights as part of reproductive health wherever it saw fit. She appeared more confident in that testimony than she ever does while campaigning. She seems least self-conscious about her anger when she is marshaling it in the service of something other than an effort to be elected. Clinton has always seemed more comfortable on the job than seeking one. Maybe what she was showing on Wednesday night was that she was already, given the polls, starting to own the authority that she will in all probability be granted on Nov. 8. Maybe Trump even noticed that, which is why, after a relatively disciplined performance, he devolved once more to personal attacks. We went from a male candidate, four years ago, professing to have binders full of women he might appoint to a male candidate actually confronted with one who is thwarting his ambitions. Small wonder he found the rude shock of it nasty <U+2014> and small wonder so many women are enjoying every minute of his discomfort with it. Susan Dominus is a staff writer for the magazine.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: opednews.com \n text: (128 fans) - Advertisement - \nPicture, if you will, video footage of vintage (early 2016) Donald Trump buffoonery with the CEO of CBS Leslie Moonves commenting on major media's choice to give Trump vastly more air time than other candidates: \"It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS.\" \nThat's the introduction to a powerful critique of the U.S. media. A new film screens in New York and Los Angeles this week called All Governments Lie: Truth, Deception, and the Spirit of I.F. Stone . \nThe website AllGovernmentsLie.com has screening dates , a list of lies , and a list of good journalists who expose lies . The lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film, but there's a good deal of overlap -- enough to give you a sense of what this project is about. \nI'd have made various changes and additions to the film. In particular, I'm tired of all the focus on Iraq 2003. This film touches on war lies since then, but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence. \nStill, this is a film that should be shown in cities, homes, and classrooms across the United States. It includes and is driven by Noam Chomsky's analysis of how the media system is \"rigged\" without those doing the rigging believing they've done anything at all. It's a survey of skullduggery by corporate media. It's an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm. And it's an introduction to I.F. Stone. It includes footage of a presentation of the annual Izzy Award which goes to journalists acting in Stone's tradition. \nOne of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the Gulf of Tonkin (non-)Incident. Anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie. And it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense. That is: had the North Vietnamese really shot back at a U.S. ship off their coast, that would not have been any sort of legal, much less moral, justification for escalating a war. I'd love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the Black Sea, the Red Sea, and every other part of the earth today. \nBut the Gulf of Tonkin lies about Vietnamese aggression against the U.S. ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of Vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the U.S. role of Global Policeman. Someone had to make the lies transparent. Someone had to document that in fact the Secretary of So-Called Defense and the President were lying. Sadly, nobody did that in the first 24 hours after the Congressional committee hearings, and that was all it took for Congress to hand the president a war. \nAnd it was decades before White House transcripts came out and before the National Security Agency confessed, and additional years before former Secretary Robert McNamara did. Yet, those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew. And they knew it because of I.F. Stone who just weeks after the (non-)incident published a four-page edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about Tonkin. - Advertisement - \nStone's analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the Red Sea off Yemen. And in fact it is to Yemen that Stone immediately turned on page 1 in 1964. The United Nations, including its U.S. ambassador, had recently condemned British attacks on Yemen that Britain defended as retaliatory. President Dwight Eisenhower had also warned the French against retaliatory attacks on Tunisia. And President Lyndon Johnson, even at the time of Tonkin, Stone notes, was warning Greece and Turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other. \nStone, who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to, pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks: the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter. The latter two are still theoretically in place for the U.S. government. \nThe United States in Vietnam, Stone goes on to show, could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of Vietnamese boats. And indeed the U.S. ships, Stone reports, were in North Vietnamese waters and were there to assist South Vietnamese ships that were shelling two North Vietnamese islands. And in fact those ships had been supplied to South Vietnam by the U.S. military and the good old American tax payers. \nStone did not have access to closed committee hearings, but he hardly needed it. He considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war. And then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees. He found their denials to be non-denials and nonsensical. It made no sense that the U.S. ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the South Vietnamese ships. Stone didn't believe it. \nStone also filled in the background information. The United States had been supporting guerrilla attacks on North Vietnam for years prior to the non-incident. And Stone raised numerous suspicions, including the question of why the U.S. ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the (non-)incident to (not) occur, and the question of why in the world Vietnam would take on the United States military (something nobody could explain, though Eugene McCarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored). - Advertisement - \nMissing from the film and website of All Governments Lie is I.F. Stone's work on lies about the outbreak of the Korean War. We've learned more since he wrote it, but seen little more insightful, relevant, or timely for our understanding of Korea and the world today.

So let<U+2019>s turn to Paul Joseph Watson from InfoWars for a little background on what this <U+201C>spirit cooking<U+201D> is really all about. \nSpirit cooking refers to <U+201C>a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley<U+201D> and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a <U+201C>painting<U+201D>. \nAccording to Marina Abramovic, if the ritual is performed in an art gallery, it is merely art, but if the ritual is performed privately, then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony. \nThe video embedded above depicts the bizarre nature of the ceremony. Abramovic mixes together thickly congealed blood as the <U+201C>recipe<U+201D> for the <U+201C>painting,<U+201D> which is comprised of the words, <U+201C>With a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain.<U+201D> \nThe ceremony is, <U+201C>meant to symbolize the union between the microcosm, Man, and the macrocosm, the Divine, which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in Hermeticism <U+201C>As Above, So Below.<U+201D> \nBelow is a video of Abramovic conducting the satanic ritual: \nHow creepy. Even creepier is the same woman holding a bloody goat<U+2019>s head <U+2013> a representation of the Satanist symbol Baphomet. The Podestas'\"Spirit Cooking\" dinner?It's not what you think.It's blood, sperm and breastmilk. \n<U+2014> WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 4, 2016 \nYeah<U+2026> \nIf you enjoyed this story, be sure to follow Sean Brown on Facebook , and check out his website, politicalcult.com . \nGod Bless.",

Those who throw stones need to address their own transgressions. But Americans and the Clintons should not dignify the situation with counterattacks on Donald Trump<U+2019>s family, to avoid causing pain to his wives and children. The American people put this scandal to rest years ago, and today we understand: No marriage is flawless. Republicans tried to exploit the Clintons<U+2019> marital issues during Bill<U+2019>s presidency, having not learned that Americans can separate the Clintons<U+2019> private matters from all they have accomplished. The right-wing attempts should fail again. Americans will vote for their candidates based on the important issues of today. SHEILA FOX Baltimore To the Editor: Hillary Clinton fought back against the truth, and she either was willfully blind to the truth or considered it a mere inconvenience to be swept away.

To the Editor: After exhaustively chronicling Benghazi and Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s email transgressions, now you run a story on how she grappled with her husband<U+2019>s infidelity. Really? This is not news. If the point of your article is that Mrs. Clinton was mean to the women who accused her husband of having sex with them, so be it. Does this suggest that her regard for women is the same as Donald Trump<U+2019>s? Hardly. She was an irate wife, fighting to save her marriage, and their careers. Politically and professionally, she has spent her career championing the rights of women and minorities. Mr. Trump has focused on enriching himself at the expense of others, while denigrating women for fun.

Vogel Eli Stokols Gabriel Debenedetti Michael Grunwald \n source: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/rnc-trump-tv-ads-230632 \n text: The RNC took heat last month from some Donald Trump supporters, who noted that the committee had spent tens of millions of dollars on ads boosting its prior nominees, but none on Trump. | AP Photo 2016 The party, which eschewed independent pro-Trump ads, is spending $3 million on coordinated ads boosting its nominee. By Kenneth P. Vogel 11/02/16 11:25 AM EDT The Republican National Committee thought TV ads supporting its presidential nominee were a bad use of its money early in the cycle, but, with polls tightening in the final week of the presidential race, the party committee is funding at least $3 million into TV ads on behalf of the Trump campaign. Some of the RNC-funded ads attack Trump<U+2019>s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton over the FBI<U+2019>s announcement last week that it was examining new evidence related to her team<U+2019>s handling of classified information while she was secretary of state. Story Continued Below The RNC-funded ads are part of a $17.7 million Trump advertising surge in the campaign<U+2019>s final week, according to an analysis of advertising buys done for POLITICO by The Tracking Firm. The RNC<U+2019>s share of the buy comes out of a pool of nearly $24 million in cash that the national party can spend in coordination with the Trump campaign. <U+201C>They worked with us to decide what<U+2019>s the best use of that money,<U+201D> said RNC chief strategist Sean Spicer, who stressed that most of the coordinated cash was spent not on television ads, but rather on the type of direct voter contact on which the RNC has focused this cycle. <U+201C>Because we<U+2019>ve been able to expand the map, it was, <U+2018>Let<U+2019>s use this money to continue to expand the map,<U+2019> and the idea was that there was greater utility in doing TV ads to expand the map,<U+201D> he added. Spicer rejected a question about whether the RNC-funded Trump ads represented a change in course for the RNC. After the 2012 election, the party decided it was going to stop spending money on television ads, and instead shift its resources to building a more robust ground game. That decision was based on a calculation that it was <U+201C>not an efficient use of party committee dollars to spend money on television,<U+201D> RNC chief of staff Katie Walsh explained to POLITICO last month. 2016 By Eli Stokols and Gabriel Debenedetti Yet, even as the RNC telegraphed this decision well in advance of the presidential race, it took heat last month from some Trump supporters, who noted that the committee had spent tens of millions of dollars on ads boosting its prior nominees, but none on Trump . But the no-advertising decision applied only to a type of advertising known as independent expenditures, Spicer explained, in which party committees are permitted to spend unlimited amounts of cash, provided they don<U+2019>t coordinate the messaging and placement with the campaigns. That restriction can make it tricky to implement independent expenditures in a way that matches the strategy of the candidate who is the intended beneficiary. Coordinated expenditures, on the other hand, must be done in conjunction with the candidate<U+2019>s campaign, allowing them to shape the decisions about what the ads say and where and when they run. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s their creative,<U+201D> Spicer said of the RNC-funded Trump ads. Indeed, the ads in question end with a message saying <U+201C>Paid for by the Republican National Committee. Authorized by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. Approved by Donald J. Trump.<U+201D> Still, legally, it<U+2019>s the party that controls coordinated expenditures, said campaign finance expert Paul Seamus Ryan, vice president of litigation at the advocacy group Common Cause. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s the national party that<U+2019>s actually making the expenditure, so the decision to cut the check is entirely the decision of the party, not the candidate,<U+201D> he said. But he added that <U+201C>by definition, the party is talking to the candidate when the party<U+2019>s making <U+2018>coordinated<U+2019> expenditures, and presumably the party would defer to the candidate<U+2019>s judgment about whether the party should be making the expenditure, what should be in the ad, etc.<U+201D> By Michael Grunwald By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz",

An erratic, nuclear-armed North still covets prosperous South Korea, which is enduring a presidential impeachment crisis even as the U.S. is in a political transition. This is a moment for some supportive bipartisan U.S. diplomacy. Prosecutors have accused a personal confidant of South Korean President Park Geun-hye of shaking down Korea<U+2019>s giant chaebol conglomerates for $70 million with the help of government officials. The case could lead to much-needed reforms to curb the power of firms that behave more like feudal fiefdoms than modern corporations<U+2014>an act of democratic hygiene. But the scandal means that Ms. Park, who has taken a hard line against the North, will be preoccupied with political survival for the 15 months remaining in her term. Her approval rating is down to 4%, and hundreds of thousands are rallying each weekend in Seoul to demand her resignation. Impeachment votes may come soon, and members of her own party have said they<U+2019>ll support her ouster. The danger is that this could be a moment when the North<U+2019>s regime thinks it can take advantage. Dictator Kim Jong Un is unpredictable at the best of times. But he and his military could misinterpret the noise of democratic debate and accountability in the South as a sign of weakness. Perhaps he might use the next round of U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises scheduled for February as an excuse for an attack or land grab. The isolated North may also mistake the U.S. political transition as an opening. In glib campaign moments this year, Donald Trump suggested that South Korea and Japan ought to be able to defend themselves and U.S. forces might come home. The President-elect has since walked that back, and in a postelection phone call with Ms. Park he confirmed that the U.S. will fulfill its treaty obligations to defend the South. A public statement from the presidential transition, perhaps in league with the Obama Administration, is in order. The U.S. also needs to convey to China that any attempt to exploit the current moment would mean the end of the regime in the North and unification to the Chinese border. Beijing needs to convey that message to its clients in Pyongyang. The point is to reduce the chances of miscalculation and war, which have happened before. After Secretary of State Dean Acheson casually placed South Korea outside the U.S. defense perimeter in 1950, Kim<U+2019>s grandfather sent his tanks across the 38th parallel. Like other totalitarian regimes, the North cultivates a fanatical belief in its martial prowess. The U.S. and South Korean forces would quickly dismantle the North Korean military, but Seoul is in range of its artillery so the carnage from even a few days of fighting would be catastrophic. The world<U+2019>s dictators always test a new American President, and some of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign statements could invite misinterpretation. The President-elect is slowly building credibility on national security as he appoints his senior team, but he and Mr. Obama should leave no doubt for adversaries to exploit amid their transition. They need to make clear that any attack by the North will be met with devastating force.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: MM \n source: sgtreport.com \n text: by Michael Pento, Market Oracle : \nOn election night, as political analysts were coming to terms with the possibility of a Trump presidency, the Dow Jones futures plummeted over 800 points, and Japan<U+2019>s benchmark Nikkei 225 plunged more than 6.1%. Investors across the country went to sleep with nightmares of protectionism (Smoot-Hawley Trade Tariffs 2.0) and the fiscal train wreck that a Trump presidency might bring. \nBut by the start of trading on November 9th, Dow futures had recouped most of their losses, and it didn<U+2019>t take long for the erstwhile despondent equity markets to turn sharply positive. \nAmerica reached a sudden epiphany that it perhaps had elected a pro-growth champion in the White House with an obsequious Republican Congress. Therefore, for those on Wall Street it became once again <U+201C>Morning in America.<U+201D> \nHowever, I would warn that before you pile your life savings into an S&P 500 ETF and fall into a complacent slumber, it<U+2019>s important to explain why the markets have gotten ahead of themselves and where things can go very wrong from here. \nThe earnings rebound for equities had been predicated on a falling USD and an oil price rebound. Most importantly, markets had relied upon the Fed<U+2019>s provision of artificially-low interest rates as far as the eye can see. However, oil prices have fallen from over $51 a barrel a month ago to $45 today. The dollar index has risen from 98.61 before the election to over 101, which is a fourteen-year high, and long-term interest rates are now spiking. \nAccording to Reuter<U+2019>s, interest rates on the 30-year fixed mortgage averaged 3.95%, up from 3.77% the prior week, the highest level since January of this year. Rates on the 15-year Fixed-rate and Five-year adjustable-rate mortgage rose to their highest levels since March. This has already started to take its toll on mortgage refinancing, as the MBA<U+2019>s weekly measure of application activity for refi<U+2019>s fell 10.9% last week. This is soon to be exacerbated when the Fed resumes its rate hiking mode in December. \nBut it<U+2019>s not just interest rates in the U.S. that are rising; rates are spiking all around the globe. For example, the Italian Ten-year yield has jumped an incredible 45% in the past few trading sessions. \nBut the perma-bulls on Wall Street, who first warned that a Trump presidency would be a disaster, now believe that a drastic rise in rates around the world will be ameliorated by a bit more growth here in the United States sometime in the future. But the President<U+2019>s protectionist trade policies and massive deficits will be an offset to much of his growth measures. \nAnd while relief on taxes and regulations is something to celebrate, as of now, not one dollar of taxes has been cut, not one regulation has been reduced, and not one shovel for a <U+201C>shovel ready job<U+201D> has been purchased. The point is that rising rates could send the anemic U.S. economy into a recession before any of Trump<U+2019>s plans come to fruition. \nAnd certainly, U.S. economic growth will not get any help from Emerging Markets (EM). As the significant correction in EM shares immediately following the election is foreboding tough times are ahead for these nations that are strapped with huge amounts of dollar denominated debt. \nBut perhaps the most important point to remember is that during the Regan Revolution, which started back in the early 1980<U+2019>s, morning in America didn<U+2019>t come overnight. It took time for those harmful Keynesian fiscal and monetary policies to work themselves through the system. It took almost two years for that imbalance to rectify, and for dawn to break for both the economy and equities. But today<U+2019>s imbalances are far greater than what was extent in 1980. \nIn November of 1980, the S&P 500 was 140; and it was at the same level in November of 1982. It wasn<U+2019>t until 1983 that the S&P 500 saw significant moves higher. Furthermore, the U.S. economy experienced two major recessions during that timeframe, as then Fed Chair Paul Volker squeezed the harmful monetary policies of the 1970<U+2019>s out of the economy. The first recession occurring between January and July 1980 and the other from July 1981 to November of 1982. \nRonald Regan reduced the top rate income tax bracket from 70% to 50%. According to CNN Money, the amalgamated plan proposed by Trump and the House could lower the top bracket to 33%. However, the top tax rate currently sits at 39.6%. Therefore, tax reductions, although good news, will not have the same effect as it did in the 80<U+2019>s. This is because marginal rates will only fall a few percentage points on those job creators, rather than the 20 percentage points enjoyed under Regan. \nFurthermore, debt levels as a percentage of GDP back during the Regan Revolution pale in comparison to those of today. A rapid increase in interest rates will make the cost to service debt extremely onerous. Add to this the massive amount of infrastructure spending that Trump has proposed and we are likely to see much larger deficits and eventually much weaker GDP growth. \nFinally, as seen in the chart below, stocks began the decade of the 80<U+2019>s with a very modest price to earnings multiples and therefore had a lot of room to run. It<U+2019>s less likely that Trump<U+2019>s <U+201C>Morning in America<U+201D> will be as favorable for stocks give today<U+2019>s lofty PE<U+2019>s. \nThe stock market is a forward-looking indicator. And while it is uplifting to see it anticipate better news for the economy, investors should understand that a massive bubble in the bond market isn<U+2019>t going to unwind with impunity-especially in light of the already overvalued stock market and the huge increase in leverage ratios that exist today. That truth extends to most asset classes and the global economy. Trump may end up turning Mourning in America to Morning<U+2026>but a surging interest rates may bring Midnight first.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: The Saker \n source: unz.com \n text: Evgeny Sribnyjj / Shutterstock.com \nSo it has happened: Hillary did not win! I say that instead of saying that <U+201C>Trump won<U+201D> because I consider the former even more important than the latter. Why? Because I have no idea whatsoever what Trump will do next. I do, however, have an excellent idea of what Hillary would have done: war with Russia. Trump most likely won<U+2019>t do that. In fact, he specifically said in his acceptance speech: \nI want to tell the world community that while we will always put America<U+2019>s interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone <U+2014> all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict . \nAnd Putin<U+2019>s reply was immediate: \nWe heard the statements he made as candidate for president expressing a desire to restore relations between our countries. We realise and understand that this will not be an easy road given the level to which our relations have degraded today, regrettably. But, as I have said before, it is not Russia<U+2019>s fault that our relations with the United States have reached this point. \nRussia is ready to and seeks a return to full-format relations with the United States. Let me say again, we know that this will not be easy, but are ready to take this road, take steps on our side and do all we can to set Russian-US relations back on a stable development track. \nThis would benefit both the Russian and American peoples and would have a positive impact on the general climate in international affairs, given the particular responsibility that Russia and the US share for maintaining global stability and security. \nThis exchange, right there, is enough of a reason for the entire planet to rejoice at the defeat of Hillary and the victory of Trump. \nWill Trump now have the courage, willpower and intelligence to purge the US Executive from the Neocon cabal which has been infiltrating it for decades now? Will he have the strength to confront an extremely hostile Congress and media? Or will he try to meet them halfway and naively hope that they will not use their power, money and influence to sabotage his presidency? \nI don<U+2019>t know. Nobody does. \nOne of the first signs to look for will be the names and backgrounds of the folks he will appoint in his new administration. Especially his Chief of Staff and Secretary of State. \nI have always said that the choice for the lesser evil is morally wrong and pragmatically misguided. I still believe that. In this case, however, the greater evil was thermonuclear war with Russia and the lesser evil just might turn out to be one which will gradually give up the Empire to save the USA rather than sacrifice the USA for the needs of the Empire. In the case of Hillary vs Trump the choice was simple: war or peace. \nTrump can already be credited with am immense achievement: his campaign has forced the US corporate media to show its true face <U+2013> the face of an evil, lying, morally corrupt propaganda machine. The American people by their vote have rewarded their media with a gigantic <U+201C>f*ck you!<U+201D> <U+2013> a vote of no-confidence and total rejection which will forever demolish the credibility of the Empire<U+2019>s propaganda machine. \nI am not so naive as to not realize that billionaire Donald Trump is also one of the 1%ers, a pure product of the US oligarchy. But neither am I so ignorant of history to forget that elites do turn on each other , especially when their regime is threatened. Do I need to remind anybody that Putin also came from the Soviet elites?! \nIdeally, the next step would be for Trump and Putin to meet, with all their key ministers, in a long, Camp David like week of negotiations in which everything, every outstanding dispute, should be put on the table and a compromise sought in each case. Paradoxically, this could be rather easy: the crisis in Europe is entirely artificial, the war in Syria has an absolutely obvious solution, and the international order can easily accommodate a United States which would <U+201C> deal fairly with everyone, with everyone <U+2014> all people and all other nations <U+201D> and <U+201C> seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict <U+201C>. The truth is that the USA and Russia have no objective reasons for conflict <U+2013> only ideological issues resulting directly from the insane ideology of messianic imperialism of those who believe, or pretend to believe, that the USA is an <U+201C>indispensable nation<U+201D>. What the world wants <U+2013> needs <U+2013> is the USA as a *normal* nation. \nThe worst case? Trump could turn out to be a total fraud. I personally very much doubt it, but I admit that this is possible. More likely is that he just won<U+2019>t have the foresight and courage to crush the Neocons and that he will try to placate them. If he does so, they will instead crush him. It is a fact that while administrations have changed every 4 or 8 years, the regime in power has not, and that US internal and foreign policies have been amazingly consistent since the end of WWII. Will Trump finally bring not just a new administration but real <U+201C>regime change<U+201D>? I don<U+2019>t know. \nMake no mistake <U+2013> even if Trump does end up disappointing those who believed in him what happened today has dealt a death blow to the Empire. The <U+201C>Occupy Wall Street<U+201D> did not succeed in achieving anything tangible, but the notion of <U+201C>rule of the 1%<U+201D> did emerge from that movement and it stayed. This is a direct blow to the credibility and legitimacy of the entire socio-political order of the USA: far from being a democracy, it is a plutocracy/oligarchy <U+2013> everybody pretty much accepts that today. Likewise, the election of Trump has already proved that the US media is a prostitute and that the majority of the American people hate their ruling class. Again, this is a direct blow to the credibility and legitimacy of the entire socio-political order. One by one the founding myths of the US Empire are crashing down and what remains is a system which can only rule by force. ORDER IT NOW \nAlexander Solzhenitsyn used to say that regimes can be measured on a spectrum which ranges from regimes whose authority is their power and regimes whose power in in their authority. In the case of the USA we now clearly can see that the regime has no other authority than its power and that makes it both illegitimate and unsustainable. \nFinally, whether the US elites can accept this or not, the US Empire is coming to an end. With Hillary, we would have had a Titanic-like denial up to the last moment which might well have come in the shape of a thermonuclear mushroom over Washington DC. Trump, however, might use the remaining power of the USA to negotiate the US global draw-down thereby getting the best possible conditions for his country. Frankly, I am pretty sure that all the key world leaders realize that it is in their interest to make as many (reasonable) concessions to Trump as possible and work with him, rather than to deal with the people whom he just removed from power. \nIf Trump can stick to his campaign promises he will find solid and reliable partners in Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. Neither Russia nor China have anything at all to gain from a confrontation or, even less so, a conflict with the USA. Will Trump have the wisdom to realize this and use it for the benefit of the USA? Or will he continue with his anti-Chinese and anti-Iranian rhetoric? \nOnly time will tell.",

Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets.\n<U+201C>What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,<U+201D> said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. <U+201C>You<U+2019>re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.\n<U+201C>You<U+2019>re not fighting Syria any more, you<U+2019>re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,<U+201D> he said.\nClinton<U+2019>s campaign dismissed the criticism, noting that both Republican and Democratic national security experts have denounced Trump as unfit to be commander-in-chief.\n<U+201C>Once again, he is parroting Putin<U+2019>s talking points and playing to Americans<U+2019> fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria,<U+201D> Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said in a statement.\nTrump said Assad is much stronger now than he was three years ago and said getting Assad to leave power was less important than defeating Islamic State.\n<U+201C>Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,<U+201D> he said.\nA memo was leaked earlier this year showing Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s State Department said on December 31, 2012 that overthrowing Syria was the <U+201C>best way to help Israel.<U+201D> \n\nThe foreign policy goals in that State Department memo just so happen to align with the goals of this powerful Israeli think tank :\n\nSeeing as how the U.S. just last month conducted an airstrike on a group of Syrian fighters to help ISIS overrun one of their positions , it<U+2019>s not unreasonable to question what the hell is actually going on here.\nUniting with Assad and Russia to destroy ISIS, as Trump has said he would do, is without a doubt the sane plan in Syria if one wants to pursue America<U+2019>s interests. Instead, Clinton and Obama are trying to both overthrow Assad by arming <U+201C>good<U+201D> rebel groups and somehow also kill ISIS on the side <U+2013> though it just so happens the weapons they<U+2019>re giving to the <U+201C>good<U+201D> rebels keep falling into ISIS<U+2019>s hands.\nThe result has been what we<U+2019>re seeing in Syria <U+2013> an endless, drawn out war leading to untold human misery, suffering, death and the migrant crisis.\nSource \n",

A co-worker and I were asked to interview people at polling places, to memorialize their thoughts about an election that might put the first African-American president in the White House. We were too shy to actually stop and talk to people. So, instead, we decided to use this as an escape from the office. We drove through Crown Heights, watching as mothers dragged their children into polling places, men huddled on corners to talk, old people walked in groups. Crown Heights<U+2019> pirate radio station played Arrested Development<U+2019>s <U+201C>Revolution<U+201D> three times in a row, followed by James Brown singing <U+201C>Say It Loud <U+2014> I<U+2019>m Black and I<U+2019>m Proud.<U+201D> Later that night, I persuaded a friend to ditch a gig working the coat check at an election night party on the Upper East Side. <U+201C>Do you really want to say you were checking the coats of rich white people on a night like this?<U+201D> He came with me to a bar in Prospect Heights. It was packed with people, watching results projected on a screen. Right before they were to announce who had won Pennsylvania, the organizers turned off the feed. <U+201C>We want to commemorate this moment with a historic photo,<U+201D> they said. An artist famous for taking group nude shots in meaningful places, Spencer Tunick, was there. He wanted to take one now. <U+201C>If you want to watch the rest of the election here, you have to get naked and be in this photo. He<U+2019>s going to take it right at the moment they declare Pennsylvania.<U+201D> I looked at my friend. He looked at me. We burst out laughing and both began to unbutton our clothes. At the moment Barack Obama<U+2019>s win for the state was declared, we were lying on the sticky barroom floor, trying not to think about germs, holding <U+201C>New York For Obama-Biden<U+201D> signs above our heads, alongside other naked bargoers <U+2014> black, white, brown, old, young, straight and gay. In New York that fall, there was a reggaeton hit about the election <U+2014> just a man chanting <U+201C>Obama<U+201D> over a beat. That song played as we pulled our clothes back on, as we ordered drink after celebratory drink, as we ran into the streets to scream and laugh and dance. That night is one of my favorites of my 20s, maybe of my life. Whenever I think of it, I think of the Talking Heads song <U+201C>Heaven,<U+201D> about a bar called Heaven that always plays your favorite song and where <U+201C>nothing ever happens.<U+201D> Something big did happen that night, but the joy seemed to suspend time, so that future conflict was unimaginable. Here we are, though, eight years later, at the end of a revolution that has not yet happened, in an election season during which seemingly everything has happened. Even if Hillary Clinton is elected, I can<U+2019>t imagine experiencing the kind of drunken euphoria that would encourage a person to lie naked on a barroom floor. I know some people are ecstatic about the prospect of the first woman president. Despite the fact that I<U+2019>ve never been ambivalent about the need for feminism, I am ambivalent about how much the nature of American power will change because it may wear a female face. And I feel a kind of weary resignation, worried that the worst is yet to come. As much as I celebrate President Obama as a statesman and a magnetic persona, when I think about that night in 2008, I think of all the ways our country hasn<U+2019>t changed. The na<U+00EF>vet<U+00E9> has soured. In its place is my disillusionment with a president who continues policies of drone warfare that have killed hundreds of civilians and who has deported huge numbers of Central American children. There is the frustration with a Congress that would rather see the country fail than collaborate with a president they believe to be inferior. There is the real bodily fear for myself and my family in an America that thinks that whether or not black people are human and shouldn<U+2019>t be murdered by the state is a matter that is up for debate. After Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Mo., my brother-in-law, who is white, told my sister, <U+201C>Every time they shoot a black boy like that, they<U+2019>re imagining shooting the president.<U+201D> In 2008, commenters fell all over themselves to declare America post-racial. In 2016, it is clear that America<U+2019>s misogyny, like its racism, is intrinsically tied to how many people define our nation. <U+201C>It won<U+2019>t stop, when it<U+2019>s over,<U+201D> friends say. Anyone who thinks deeply about the amount of vitriol displayed during this election knows that it cannot disappear overnight. The people spewing hate won<U+2019>t suddenly go back to their lives, polite and free of bias. Some friends say, smugly, <U+201C>Don<U+2019>t worry, this is the last dying gasp of hatred in this country.<U+201D> But I don<U+2019>t know that I can be that optimistic. The rise of a presidential candidate who has abandoned reality, who is forgiven for every lie and about-face, simply because he<U+2019>s continually willing to disavow people of color and insult women <U+2014> that suggests that this will not go away quickly. Grappling with our faults has never been this country<U+2019>s strong suit. We prefer, instead, as Mrs. Clinton said in the second debate, to believe <U+201C>we are great because we are good,<U+201D> without necessarily demonstrating that goodness. Out of a sinking sense of duty, I tried to make myself watch all three debates. The first one I watched at the house of a friend. Her young son yelled, exasperated, <U+201C>Speak English!<U+201D> as Mr. Trump left sentences hanging broken in the air. The second one, I couldn<U+2019>t watch at all. Before it started, I<U+2019>d had Sunday dinner with my family <U+2014> my sisters, my brother-in-law, my uncle and mother and boyfriend. <U+201C>Who<U+2019>s voting for him?<U+201D> one of my sisters kept asking, insistent and angry. She has always hated bullies. My other sister said, <U+201C>Some of my friends from my mothers<U+2019> group,<U+201D> and then everyone at the table broke into argument, even though we were all agreeing. <U+201C>Those women won<U+2019>t vote for Clinton,<U+201D> my sister said, <U+201C>because they say they want to punish her for staying with her husband,<U+201D> and that was so depressing that when they all moved to the living room to turn on the debate, I went to another part of the house and sat with my nephew and watched a show about building homes in the trees. He told me a story about Sonic the Hedgehog poisoning the blood of wayward cows <U+2014> he took great pleasure in this grotesque make-believe <U+2014> and I thought that fiction made more sense than what this election has become. The final debate I watched at a friend<U+2019>s house with my fingers in my ears <U+2014> I can<U+2019>t listen to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s voice anymore without my stomach tying up in knots. When it was over, I apologized to my host for watching this way. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m a child,<U+201D> I said. She smiled and said <U+201C>Every person of color I know is doing that metaphorically right now.<U+201D> A few days later, I brushed my hand against my cheek and found, on the tip of my finger, my first gray eyelash. As if it couldn<U+2019>t be clearer that it was not 2008 anymore, here was the proof in the body, white and glaring. I looked at it for a long moment, thinking of what this meant <U+2014> my body is no longer young, this world is so greedy and grasping it<U+2019>s mining the very life of my lashes away. Then I took a photo of it to post to Instagram and blew the lash away, making a wish. In an attempt to avoid turning every lash white, I have searched for a new motto for after this election. It is not the lazy hope of a place full of familiar sounds where nothing ever happens. Instead, it<U+2019>s a wish that whatever comes next, we will still have the will to work to fix it.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Kommersant, Pavel Tarasenko, Mikhail Korostikov \n source: rbth.com \n text: navy , RBTH Daily , spain , syria Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov in international waters off the coast of Northern Norway on Oct. 17, 2016. Source: Reuters \nMadrid has decided not to allow the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov to refuel in the port of Ceuta, a Spanish enclave on the North African coast, reneging on a previous agreement with Moscow. \nOn Oct. 26, the warships of the Northern Fleet's aircraft carrier group led by the cruiser Admiral Kuznetsov , having passed the English Channel, were moving toward Gibraltar. \nTheir route and tasks, according to presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov, are \"in a sealed envelope marked 'Top Secret'.\" \nAs the Spanish Foreign Ministry said earlier, the ships were to arrive on Oct. 28 in the port of Ceuta (a Spanish enclave in Morocco). The permit, as Madrid noted, was issued in September. \nHowever, when the news of the imminent arrival of the ships in Ceuta made the press, Spain came under heavy criticism from its NATO allies. \nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that he would not have had anything against the refueling of Russian ships in other circumstances, but now he was extremely concerned that they could be used to attack Aleppo. Similar statements were made by politicians and military figures from the UK and the U.S. \nIn Spain itself, the Republican Left of Catalonia was most vocal in protesting against the arrival of the Russian ships in Ceuta. Their press service confirmed to Kommersant that members of the Congress of Deputies of Spain from the party had demanded that acting Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo and acting Defense Minister Pedro Morenesa explain why Russian ships involved in the Syrian operation were being serviced in the territory of a NATO country. 9 intriguing facts about the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier \nInitially, the Ceuta authorities were confused about the situation. Since 2011, the enclave's port has been visited, according to the newspaper El Pais, by 60 Russian vessels. \n\"The normal criteria for accepting the visits was 'the safety of the surroundings, population and port',\" The Spain Report said, citing sources in the port's administration. But under the barrage of criticism, the Spanish Foreign Ministry announced yesterday that it was reviewing \"the decision following consultations.\" \nBut by the middle of the day, El Pais quoted diplomatic sources as saying permission would be revoked if it was confirmed that the ships were heading to Syria. Without waiting for the outcome, the Russian authorities themselves abandoned the idea. \"We affirm that the ships will not enter the port of Ceuta, because the route has changed,\" the Russian Embassy in Spain said. Moscow's reaction \nSpeaking to Kommersant, the Embassy's press secretary Vasily Nioradze Embassy urged the media not to dramatize the situation. \"Approval of such stopovers is a routine process,\" he said. \"We send a request in advance, and the decision is made based on international law and the requirements of the host country. Now this decision was made, in other cases it will be different.\" \nDefense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov chose to place a different accent on the incident: According to him, the Russian military department provided for the possibility of \"a technical stopover [in Ceuta <U+2013> Kommersant] of individual ships or a supply vessel from the group of ships, in agreement with the Spanish side.\" \nHowever, according to him, no official request from the Defense Ministry was sent to Madrid. \n\"The representatives of the Spanish leadership said that due to the pressure on them from the U.S. and NATO, the entry of the Russian ships in the port of Ceuta would be inappropriate,\" said Konashenkov. Publicly, however, the Spanish authorities did not make such statements. Russian experts: Cruiser is on training mission \nRuslan Pukhov, director of the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies (TsAST), does not view the change of the Admiral Kuznetsov 's route as a disaster. \n\"We might as well refuel in Algeria or Malta, I<U+2019>m betting on Algeria since Malta is an EU member state and it will face the same problems as Spain,\" he told Kommersant. Russia to establish a permanent naval base in Syria \nAt the same time, according to Pukhov, the arrival of the Admiral Kuznetsov in Syria is unlikely to radically change the balance of forces in the region, but it will allow Russia to increase its international prestige. \n\"The French use an aircraft carrier in that region, because they do not have a base, while we do have one,\" he said. <U+201C>The purpose of the Kuznetsov 's mission is likely to be training. Pilots of deck aircraft need to train, and Syria provides an opportunity to do it in combat conditions.\" \nTsAST expert Andrei Frolov added that the Admiral Kuznetsov 's mission has \"an advertising component.\"\"India is thinking about buying MiG-29K/KUB deck fighters for future aircraft carriers, and a demonstration of their capabilities in Syria will help it decide sooner,<U+201D> he said.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Daniel McAdams \n source: antiwar.com \n text: Share This \nLooking over the global landscape, the areas most touched by US interventionist foreign policy are objectively in the worst, most desperate shape. The mainstream media will report that the current disaster in Syria came about because the people decided to stand up to a cruel dictator in the <U+201C>Arab Spring<U+201D> that swept through the greater Middle East in 2011, and that the dictator cracked down so hard it caused the violence to spin out of control. We know, of course, that is not the whole story. The US had been involved in fomenting unrest in Syria at least five years or more before violence broke out. A WikiLeaks-released cable from 2006 shows how hard the US Embassy in Damascus was working to figure out a way to overthrow the government. Shortly after the partially manufactured protests devolved into violence, the CIA moved in and began arming (and importing) rebels to finish the deed. In five years the country has been destroyed, hundreds of thousands killed, millions left without homes. \nLikewise, even most critics of the 2003 US attack on Iraq will try to salvage the philosophy of interventionism by claiming the only reason democracy hasn<U+2019>t broken out is that the US military didn<U+2019>t occupy the country long enough! As if being occupied by a foreign power is the route to responsible governance and the development of civil society! \nThere are too many other examples to mention, even little-discussed areas like Somalia and Nigeria <U+2013> with the latter falling prey to a radical Islamist gang, Boko Haram, that benefited from a region awash in weapons after the US-led attack on Libya opened the weapons depots. \nThe US was actively involved in breaking up Sudan, which we were told was being run into the ground by <U+201C>Arabs<U+201D> ruling from the north who were abusing black Africans in the south. I was once invited to lunch by the Sudanese ambassador to Washington while I was working on the Hill and he asked me, <U+201C>do I look like an Arab to you?<U+201D> Needless to say, I doubt anyone would have guessed he was not what the US government considered a <U+201C>black African.<U+201D> His point was that the dispute was being created artificially by external sources. In fact the US and its allies were determined to break the country up (hint: it had a lot to do with oil) and would settle for any pretext. The result has not been the peaceful South Sudan ruled locally that was promised. Instead the new country launched with the help of <U+201C>humanitarian interventionists<U+201D> like US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power has proven to be orders of magnitude worse off than when it was under Khartoum<U+2019>s rule. \nThe track record of US interventionism is so universally disastrous that slowly but steadily the rest of the world is pushing back against a US foreign policy that is making their own lives less safe. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban, for example, gave an interview to a German newspaper recently in which he singled out US foreign policy as a force for harm rather than good in the world. \nSaid Orban: \nAmerica believes in the exportation of democracy. This sounds good; however, wherever it has been tried, entire regions often became destabilized, the consequences of which are suffering, death and migration. Additionally, often anti-democratic, extremist forces rose to power as a result of the free elections. \nBelieving in the democracy export is arrogant because it fails to take the cultural structures of the given regions into consideration. But whether you like it or not, it is the culture that determines the political culture. \nThat is pretty pointed criticism coming from a close NATO ally and the representative of a pro-US, center-right government. But this week the Hungarians celebrate the 60th anniversary of their 1956 revolution to extricate themselves from under the Soviet boot, so it is understandable that they have the idea of national sovereignty fresh in their minds. \nIn a recent episode of Ron Paul<U+2019>s Liberty Report, we discussed Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte<U+2019>s announcement last week that he wanted to separate his country from domination by US foreign policy. The US has been determined to use the Philippines as a weapon in its arsenal against a China newly assertive in the South China Sea, but many in the Philippines <U+2013> the president included it seems <U+2013> see little benefit to going on war footing against a neighbor with your ally thousands of miles away. \nWhat can the interventionists offer when the fruits of their philosophy are laid bare? Lies and obfuscation. Manipulation of media messages. Demonization of those who oppose the neoconservatives and <U+201C>humanitarian<U+201D> interventionists who run Washington<U+2019>s foreign policy. But as Dr. Paul has said with increasing frequency lately, their failure is our big opportunity. We must educate ourselves on their failures and we must train ourselves to make the case for a pure noninterventionist foreign policy as the only way to keep us safe. \nDaniel McAdams is director of the The Ron Paul Institute for Peace & Prosperity .

        "input": "time: null \n author: Ben Eisen \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-win-fuels-bets-on-inflation-1478821303 \n text: Donald Trump <U+2019>s victory has unleashed investor bets on rising consumer prices, a trade that has been tried often in recent years with little lasting success. A bond-market gauge on Thursday hit its highest level since the summer of 2015. The 10-year break-even inflation rate indicated expected annual inflation of 1.89% over the next 10 years. That measure, reflecting the gap in yields between Treasurys and their inflation-protected counterparts, known as TIPS, was 1.73% two days ago, according to Tradeweb. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises when bond prices fall, climbed another 0.05 percentage point on Thursday to 2.118%. It has jumped a quarter of a percentage point since before the U.S. election result, the biggest two-day rise since 2011. Nominal bond rates have been rising faster than those protected against inflation, meaning that inflation protection is increasingly viewed as the more attractive investment. The bond selloff is the latest example of the wagers investors have placed that Mr. Trump will succeed in speeding the economy and pushing up prices, by boosting spending on infrastructure, cutting corporate and personal income taxes, and encouraging corporations to repatriate overseas cash. If enacted by a Republican-controlled Congress , the policies could help heat up tepid growth and add to U.S. deficits, potentially bolstering inflation, which has lingered below the Federal Reserve<U+2019>s 2% annual target for more than four years, many investors say. But betting on inflation is a trade some investors have been making on and off for years, with limited success. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s one of three or four favored trades that work in bursts on occasion,<U+201D> said Jim Vogel, an interest-rate strategist at FTN Financial. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s only succeeded in small amounts over short periods.<U+201D> One spark for the latest inflation trade came when Mr. Trump mentioned infrastructure spending prominently Wednesday morning in his victory speech, investors say. Others believe efforts to repeal financial regulations enacted by President Barack Obama <U+2019>s administration could expand bank lending activity, and that restrictions on trade could boost wages in an already strong labor market. Other assets that have gained since the election include financial stocks, which outperformed the broader market, and copper futures, which climbed 3.7% Thursday. At the same time, the force behind the trade over the past two days has led many to grow skeptical, saying that the climb in inflation expectations is based in part on unfulfilled hope. Mr. Trump doesn<U+2019>t take office until January, and his policy priorities aren<U+2019>t fully known, making TIPS and other products linked to inflation susceptible to a reversal at any time if, say, disappointing inflation data arrive meanwhile. Investors have been betting on a rise in inflation since late June, due to climbing prices for services and stabilizing commodities. Since the beginning of November, they have poured a net $1.45 billion into the largest exchange-traded fund tracking TIPS, the iShares TIPS Bond ETF , including $91.9 million on Wednesday, according to Morningstar. Raman Srivastava, managing director of global fixed income at Standish Mellon Asset Management Co., said his firm added to holdings of TIPS and other global inflation-linked securities on Wednesday after the election. <U+201C>We think there<U+2019>s pressure [pushing up] inflation even before you talk about stimulus from the U.S. government,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>This new development in regards to the election increases the odds of that.<U+201D> Market-derived inflation forecasts are controversial since they can bounce around based on short-term factors like the oil price. While the Fed has indicated that it looks at break-evens as one market gauge, it describes them as compensation for the risk of inflation, rather than an outright expectation. A separate survey-based measure of inflation expectations was at its lowest on record last month. The most recent move has been confounding in part because it has little to do with corresponding moves in other markets. Oil is down slightly since before the election results, and gold prices haven<U+2019>t seen a similarly sharp climb. Inflation expectations in other countries have been relatively muted, Mr. Vogel noted. One way to look at that divergence in inflationary assets is to observe correlations, which look at the relationship between two independent variables. A correlation of 1 means they move together in lockstep while a correlation of -1 means they rise and fall in exactly the opposite direction. The 20-day rolling correlation between crude and the 10-year break-even inflation rate fell to minus-0.50 on Thursday from as high as 0.95 in mid-October, according to data from WSJ Market Data Group and Tradeweb. Still, investors appear enthused by rising inflation expectations, partly because Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election and the shifting makeup of Congress, if nothing else, mean a sharp change from a period in which central banks struggled to spur inflation. BlackRock Inc., Pacific Investment Management Co. and other bond powerhouses have recommended TIPS in recent years. Martin Hegarty, head of inflation-linked bond portfolios at BlackRock, said he briefly added to bets on a rise in long-term bond yields following the election results. <U+201C>I do believe that the potential for tax reform and for a different regulatory environment in an already tight labor market has the potential to push up the run rate of inflation,<U+201D> said Mr. Hegarty.

It does not matter which person or political party occupies the White House and Capitol Hill. The debt orgy that followed the Fed<U+2019>s QE program is now showing visible signs of unintended but inevitable consequences and it<U+2019>s beginning smell a lot like 2008. \nPer RealtyTrac , U.S. foreclosure activity increased 27% from September to October. Foreclose starts posted the biggest monthly increase since<U+2026>December 2008. Scheduled foreclosure auctions posted the biggest monthly increase since 2006. The data is even more startling in certain States. Foreclosures in Colorado jumped 64% in October from September and foreclosure starts soared 71%. Colorado tends to be an economic and demographic bellweather State. In the housing bubble 1.0, foreclosure activity in Colorado began to accelerate before it hit all the other major MSAs. \nJust in time for foreclose activity to ramp up, the Obama Government rolled new Fannie and Freddie mortgage programs which removed or reduced required mortgage insurance. Once again the Taxpayers will be left holding the bag and monetizing a mortgage collapse from which the bankers, real estate and mortgage industry collected $100<U+2019>s of millions in fee money. \nPer this analysis posted by Wolf Richter, the Miami condo market is in a freefall: LINK . Mortgage rates have spiked up considerably in the last week. This will extinguish a significant amount of home sales and cash-out refi<U+2019>s <U+2013> note <U+2013> the following is an excerpt from the latest issue of my Short Seller<U+2019>s Journal : \nI continue to see with my own eyeballs, which I trust a lot more than the manipulated b.s. reported by the National Association of Realtors and the Government<U+2019>s Census Bureau, a stunning number of <U+201C>for sale<U+201D> and <U+201C>for rent<U+201D> signs all around central Denver. Note that Colorado has 11,000 people per month moving here, so if inventory in both homes for sale and rentals are visibly increasing here it means they are increasing everywhere. \nI<U+2019>ve heard horror stories about the south Florida market from several sources. A colleague who runs a real estate brokerage firm in Houston published a report last week on a growing glut in luxury apartments in Houston: LINK . \nI bought Toll Brothers (TOL) December $28-strike puts on Thursday for 64 cents. The stock at the time was $29.40. It closed Friday at $28.25. I also bought Pulte Home (PHM) January $18-strike puts for 72 cents. The stock at the time was $18.65. It closed Friday at $18.32. \nI did this after chatting with the friend of mine mentioned earlier who is a mortgage broker. We are working on a refi for my significant other, which is why he called me on Thursday to see if I wanted to rate-lock her loan after informing me that the mortgage market was getting <U+201C>funky<U+201D> and spreads were widening. \nFinally, again just like the mid-2000<U+2019>s housing bubble, NYC is showing definitive signs that its housing market is crumbling very quickly. Landlord rent concessions soared 24% in October, more than double the 10.4% concession rate in October 2015. Typical concessions include one free month or payment of broker fees at lease signing. Days to lease an apartment on average increased 15% over 2015 in October to 46 days. And inventory listings are up 23% year over year. \nDR Horton (DHI) reported earnings on Tuesday. It missed both revenues and earnings. The stock was hit 5.4% that day and closed even lower by Friday. Any stock that sold off on Thursday and Friday while the stock market was going orbital has real problems. DHI reported the slowest order growth rate in three years. More troubling from my perspective is that, with the market obviously slowing down, DHI<U+2019>s inventories continue to balloon, increasing by $537 million to $8.3 billion vs $7.8 billion at the end of September 2015. The Company<U+2019>s cancellation rate jumped to 28% from 23% last year. Again, this smells exactly like 2008<U+2026>perhaps this part of the reason the Dow Jones Home Construction index looks so ugly: \nThe graph above shows the Dow Jones Home Construction index vs the S&P 500 for the past year. Since hitting 601 on July 26, the index is down 14%. It<U+2019>s down 16.5% from its 52 week high of 618 on December 1, 2015. As you can see, the index is below both its 50 and 200 dma<U+2019>s (yellow line and red line, respectively). The 50 dma is about to cross below the 200 dma, another potentially highly bearish techincal indicator. Perhaps first and foremost is the fact that the homebuilders were extremely weak relative to the buying frenzy that gripped the market Wed thru Friday. \nIn my opinion, it<U+2019>s safe to put a fork in the housing market. And this is the primary reason that it smells to me a lot like 2008. \nYou can access the Short Seller<U+2019>s Journal with this LINK or by clicking on the graphic to the right. Almost all of the ideas I have presented since early August have been working, some have been yielding tremendous returns.

Legal cannabis activities generated an output of $2.39 billion in 2015, with almost $1 billion in sales for the year. The sales represent a 42.4 percent increase from the previous year, translating into a staggering 112 metric tons of buds and 132 metric tons of <U+201C>flower-equivalent<U+201D> products (edibles, concentrates, etc.). \nCannabis now ranks number six in terms of product sales, following closely behind cigarette sales. It beats gold mining by a large margin, and even performing arts and sports venues as well as all non-grain crop farming. \nHowever, the real impact is seen when put in terms of <U+201C>output and employment per dollar spent,<U+201D> where spending in the cannabis industry outperforms all private industries in Colorado <U+2013> including coal and other mining, oil and gas, casinos, business services, general manufacturing and retail trade (incl. alcohol). \nEach dollar spent on retail cannabis generates $2.40 in state output, while cannabis manufacturing follows with $2.34 and cannabis cultivation comes in at a close $2.13. Combining the three, cannabis is generating far more than any other entity, including federal government spending. \nMuch of this has to do with the fact that the Colorado cannabis industry operates almost entirely within the state, due to continuing prohibition in other states. \nThere is equally impressive news in the jobs sector, where legal cannabis created more than 18,000 jobs in a year . \n<U+201C>Legalization of marijuana created 18,005 fulltime equivalent (FTE) jobs in 2015. Among those jobs, 12,591 were employees directly involved with the marijuana business <U+2014> either in stores and dispensaries, cultivations, or infused product manufacturing operations. The remaining 5,414 full-time equivalent positions were generated by intermediate input purchases made by the cannabis industry for general business goods and services, and through general spending by marijuana industry employees and proprietors.<U+201D> \nSecurity guards comprise a significant portion of these indirect jobs, due in large part to the fact that the industry is still being forced to operate on a cash basis <U+2014> because of asinine banking prohibitions by the federal government and the Federal Reserve . \nThis isn<U+2019>t stopping entrepreneurs and other productive individuals from taking advantage of the new, wildly popular market. Legal cannabis is having profound effects in many other industries, including commercial real estate, construction, and a raft of business services. \nThe cannabis industry itself is growing at a faster pace than any other sector, at an astonishing 42.4 percent. Colorado<U+2019>s general economic growth is at 3.5 percent and the U.S. average is 1.75 percent. \nThe growth analysis found a very interesting result that supports a primary argument for ending prohibition. 36.2 percent of the economic growth was the result of the disappearance of the black market. \nWhen people are free to indulge in the personal behavior of ingesting a substance <U+2013> as they can with alcohol <U+2013> they will naturally choose to do so through the legal market, even if it means having to pay exorbitant taxes. \nAnd Colorado is gladly raking in this tax revenue. \n<U+201C>In 2015, marijuana taxes were the second largest revenue source among excise products in the state (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, and gaming). \nCombined marijuana excise and sales tax revenues were $63.4 million in 2014, and $121.2 million in 2015. 5 For 2015, they were 14 percent larger than casino/gaming revenues, 6 about 5 percent less than lottery revenues, and almost three times larger than alcohol revenues.<U+201D> \nThe huge increase in tax revenue is primarily caused by the rapid increase in recreational use sales since legalization in 2014, and the fact that recreational products are taxed at a much higher rate than medical cannabis products. \nInterestingly, the report noted that a significant portion of the cannabis industry growth is coming from visitors who go to Colorado on cannabis vacations, rather than some other reason like skiing or hiking. \n<U+201C>This visitor demand segment is poised to grow from 14 metric tons in 2015, to 55.1 metric tons by 2020, based upon these new, sole-purpose visitors choosing Colorado as a marijuana destination.<U+201D> \nIf there is one negative aspect to the report, it is that small cannabusinesses are struggling to stay alive as the industry becomes dominated by larger companies. While some of this is the natural result of competition, it appears that many of them are being regulated out of business by the state. \n<U+201C>Private industry owners purport that consolidation is not being caused purely by price competition, but instead by high compliance costs. For example, the owner of one of Colorado<U+2019>s largest retailers recently stated that many small operations are unable to properly comply with the state<U+2019>s complex regulations, leading them to exit the market.<U+201D> \nThere lies the hidden barb of legalization. There<U+2019>s no question that ending prohibition is the right thing to do, but government tends to place needless, cumbersome burdens on free enterprise which favors larger conglomerates and smothers the little guy. This ultimately leads to less competition and the tendency for monopolies to develop, which makes it easier for government to siphon their taxes. \nAll in all, though, the analysis by the Marijuana Policy Group is heartening, and it shows other states how incredibly beneficial it is when people regain freedom and a new market is born. The report is especially timely, as nine states will be voting in less than a week to expand legal access to cannabis through recreational and medicinal means. Share Google + T.

The path to a solution<U+2014>if one exists at all<U+2014>leads through Beijing, Pyongyang<U+2019>s main sponsor. Is there a Grand Bargain to be made? Soon, we<U+2019>ll have a brash negotiator in the White House in place of the cautious, cerebral Barack Obama. <U+201C>I like making deals, preferably big deals,<U+201D> Donald Trump writes in the opening chapter of <U+201C>Trump: The Art of the Deal.<U+201D> <U+201C>That<U+2019>s how I get my kicks.<U+201D> Should he bring these entrepreneurial instincts to the presidency, it would not only change the way America and China conduct business but potentially remake the East Asian landscape. Within academic and think-tank circles, discussion of a sweeping settlement between the U.S. superpower and its Chinese challenger has picked up as tensions build in the South China Sea. North Korea is a possible catalyst, if not for a comprehensive bargain then at least for a broad discussion about the shape of regional security. Mr. Obama stressed <U+201C>strategic patience<U+201D> as Pyongyang pursued its nuclear ambitions. Mr. Trump will face a moment of decision when North Korea acquires the ability to strike the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Writing before the election, Amitai Etzioni, a professor of international relations at George Washington University, suggested a trade-off in which China agrees to twist Pyongyang<U+2019>s arm over its nuclear program in return for Washington accepting greater Chinese influence in its immediate neighborhood. His university colleague, Charles L. Glaser, proposes that America drop its commitment to defend Taiwan<U+2014>the thorniest issue in U.S.-China relations<U+2014>in exchange for China<U+2019>s agreeing to peacefully resolve island disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea. Even more imaginatively, Hugh White, professor of strategic studies at Australian National University, envisages an arrangement in which U.S. primacy gives way to joint regional management along with China, Japan and India. Others recommend that America march its troops off the Korean Peninsula, or sail its fleets away from Japan. What all these ideas have in common is a belief that without significant American concessions to Beijing<U+2019>s regional aspirations the risks of conflict will escalate. The direction of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s foreign policy is uncertain. He<U+2019>s threatened to launch a trade war with China . And he plans a massive investment in the Navy, including aircraft carriers, the spearhead of U.S. projection of force in East Asia. That looks more like a strategy to contain China. Or are these just the opening moves in a marathon negotiation? The first offer is already on the table. James Woolsey, a former CIA director and a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, has declared that the U.S. is ready to assure Beijing it won<U+2019>t pursue the overthrow of the Chinese political and social systems <U+201C>in exchange for China<U+2019>s commitment not to challenge the status quo in Asia.<U+201D> Beijing likely won<U+2019>t engage on that one; it considers the current state of affairs, underpinned by U.S. military alliances, to be an intolerable Cold War relic designed to throttle its rise. Still, China is convinced that America wants to subvert the Communist regime through support for political dissidents, student activists in Hong Kong and separatists in Tibet, and it will welcome a White House that spends less time lecturing on human rights. Some Chinese analysts calculate that Mr. Trump will be more focused on fixing America<U+2019>s domestic economic problems than pushing ideological values abroad. Writing in an opinion piece in the New York Times, Eric X. Li, a Shanghai-based entrepreneur and political scientist, argues that Sino-U.S. relations may take an initial nose-dive under Mr. Trump on trade but then recover <U+201C>as the Chinese prefer a relationship with a United States that doesn<U+2019>t try to remake the world.<U+201D> Yet if Mr. Trump intends a more adventurous style of international diplomacy, he<U+2019>s weakened his position with Beijing from the outset. Allies are alarmed by his <U+201C>America First<U+201D> rhetoric. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe rushed to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s gilded Manhattan penthouse last week to meet the real-estate magnate who has spent three decades berating his country as a freeloader. The move suggested great concern the two countries<U+2019> security alliance was in jeopardy. Mr. Abe came away saying that Mr. Trump was a man inspiring <U+201C>great confidence.<U+201D> Of course, the region<U+2019>s balance could be upended if Mr. Trump pursues the trade war with China that he has threatened. And he may have lost more leverage by pledging to walk away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a giant U.S.-led free-trade deal<U+2014>a promise that has recharged regional interest in China-backed trade initiatives . As American influence wanes in East Asia, expect more countries to follow the Philippines and Malaysia and jump on the Beijing bandwagon. Dealing with an America that since World War II has stood steadfastly behind its friends<U+2014>and values<U+2014>has suddenly become a lot less predictable.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Heather Caygle Kyle Cheney Michael Grunwald \n source: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/house-pelosi-231485 \n text: Nancy Pelosi<U+2019>s announcement comes at a tenuous time.  | Getty By Heather Caygle and Kyle Cheney 11/16/16 08:52 PM EST Nancy Pelosi is flexing her muscle as House Democrats<U+2019> longtime leader, moving to brush aside a fledgling rebellion in the ranks and reassert control of her caucus. An insurrection had been brewing, with Ohio<U+2019>s Tim Ryan calling for a review of party leadership and a renewed focus on working-class voters after the Democrats suffered crushing swing-state losses on Election Day. But Pelosi, a California Democrat and prodigious fundraiser, made clear on Wednesday that she could easily beat back Ryan<U+2019>s challenge. Story Continued Below Pelosi announced Wednesday she was running for reelection as House minority leader, sending a <U+201C>Dear Colleague<U+201D> letter to the 193 current and incoming members asking for their support but making clear she already had more than enough commitments to win. <U+201C>It is with both humility and confidence that I write to request your support for House Democratic Leader. As of this writing, I am pleased to report the support of more than two-thirds of the Caucus,<U+201D> she wrote. Pelosi<U+2019>s announcement comes at a tenuous time <U+2014> she was forced to delay leadership elections after an uprising from rank-and-file members Tuesday. But quickly announcing widespread support in the caucus could put to rest any rumors of a potential challenger and shows her standing remains strong despite this week<U+2019>s internal turmoil. Ryan had floated the idea of challenging Pelosi for the top Democratic post but has yet to formally declare a run. Ryan or anyone else knocking off Pelosi was a long shot even before her announcement Wednesday. <U+201C>Frankly, I think he<U+2019>s flattered by the attention that he<U+2019>s gotten,<U+201D> Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.) said. <U+201C>But he knows how to count too.<U+201D> Pelosi has a loyal following among the Democratic Caucus, which she has led for 14 years. She is a powerhouse fundraiser, having brought in $568 million since entering Democratic leadership in 2002. She<U+2019>s also well known for her ability to whip votes and keep her caucus in line. But those strengths are sometimes criticized as weaknesses. Members privately complain that Pelosi has accumulated so much power that she has effectively become the entire leadership team. And other lawmakers have wondered in recent days how much her fundraising ability matters if they pick up just a handful of seats in elections. House Democrats grappled with their Election Day drubbing in a Wednesday morning meeting, trying to come to terms with why they gained only six seats after months of bragging about the potential for double-digit gains. Nearly 130 members attended the meeting, and several described the huddle as much calmer than the strained caucus meeting the day before, when several rank-and-filers successfully pushed to have leadership elections delayed until Nov. 30. Multiple members described the meeting as more of a cathartic gripe session and not a referendum on any one leader, particularly Pelosi. <U+201C>Everybody<U+2019>s got to look in the mirror,<U+201D> Larson said, noting that the same kind of <U+201C>soul searching<U+201D> occurred in 2010 after Democrats lost 63 seats and the majority. <U+201C>This is not extraordinary,<U+201D> Larson said. <U+201C>This happens after every election, at least every election since 2010.<U+201D> But there<U+2019>s definitely still angst within the caucus about the election and lawmakers<U+2019> ongoing leadership issues, even if members don<U+2019>t want to publicly disparage Pelosi. Several members who emerged from Wednesday<U+2019>s meeting described their sometimes contradictory conclusions. They admitted to fundamentally misunderstanding the electorate, squeezing out their more moderate members and relying too heavily on a national message that wasn<U+2019>t necessarily tailored to the needs of individual House districts. But nearly all agreed Pelosi bears no blame for those failings and that she should remain Democratic leader. <U+201C>I think she ought to be overwhelmingly brought back and stay and do the great work she<U+2019>s already been doing,<U+201D> said incoming Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.), the former governor of the Sunshine State. Crist noted that Democrats gained seats in the House while losing the White House to Republicans and missing a chance to retake the Senate. Retiring Rep. Steve Israel, who ran House Democrats<U+2019> campaign arm during the 2012 and 2014 elections, said Democrats failed on multiple fronts and were too heavily dependent on pollsters and analysts, rather than evaluating voter sentiments. He also said Democrats imposed a national message onto local races where it didn<U+2019>t work. Most important, he said, Democrats had failed after previous wipeouts in recent years to assess their losses appropriately. <U+201C>We can<U+2019>t do an analysis of what went wrong with the same people and the same theories in Washington, D.C.,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We need to go into those battleground districts, we need to figure out how does a Democrat get elected to the school board in an area that voted for Donald Trump. <U+2026> It<U+2019>s going to take a shift of the thinking from sterile buildings here to the experts on the ground in those Trump neighborhoods who are winning as Democrats.<U+201D> But Israel said that despite hand-wringing and feelings of despair, the Democratic Party might be stronger now than it was before last week<U+2019>s mauling. <U+201C>There is a sense that, ironically, we<U+2019>re on more solid political ground than we were one week and a day ago, because the president<U+2019>s party always suffers losses in the midterm,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>So we<U+2019>ve got to exploit that.<U+201D> Moderate Democrats griped that the party<U+2019>s message had moved too far away from its <U+201C>big tent<U+201D> mind-set. <U+201C>Where are all the liberal seats we need to win the majority?

Most of the complications in and around the polls were of the typical variety, such as long lines and machine glitches. That included in Durham County, N.C., and Maricopa County, Ariz., which had problems with computerized equipment used to check in voters. The issues slowed down some polling sites but didn<U+2019>t interrupt voting altogether. The North Carolina Board of Elections late Tuesday extended polling hours at eight voting precincts in Durham County for up to an hour. North Carolina could prove a crucial state in the presidential contest. Officials with the Hillary Clinton campaign were monitoring the North Carolina situation closely because the state<U+2019>s tally could be close and the waiting times appeared to be at sites that were in solid Clinton territory. The day featured a court battle in Nevada after Donald Trump <U+2019>s campaign filed a lawsuit seeking to quarantine some ballots filed at several Las Vegas early-voting locations filled with likely Democratic voters. A county judge rejected the request to issue such an order. The campaign argued that Clark County officials unlawfully extended voting hours at some early-voting sites on Friday, the final day of the early-voting period. The county responded that most early-voting locations had lines at closing time, and those voters were processed <U+201C>until the lines were gone,<U+201D> which it said was consistent with its longstanding practices. The Trump lawsuit appeared to raise potential questions about several hundred votes, a total unlikely to affect the race unless the margin in Nevada is razor thin. The complaint, however, tapped into Mr. Trump<U+2019>s claims on the campaign trail that the election process was tilted against him. A lawyer for Mr. Trump said the campaign wanted to preserve evidence for a possible challenge to state voting results, but the judge said Clark County election officials were already under a legal requirement to preserve records because they are a public agency. Mr. Trump and his supporters have been vocal in recent months with concerns about election fraud, while Democrats have been equally public with their worries about possible voter suppression and intimidation, especially in light of what they viewed as inflammatory rhetoric from Mr. Trump. Reports of voter harassment, however, appeared few on Tuesday, including in heavily Democratic parts of Philadelphia, areas where Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign had been eager to deploy polling-place monitors. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s really been zero intimidation,<U+201D> said Harriet Katz, a law professor at Rutgers Law School who volunteered to spend several hours watching a handful of polling places in southwest Philadelphia. A coalition of civil-rights groups running a national voting help line fielded more than 30,000 calls from citizens going to the polls. Many of the calls involved issues with polling sites that didn<U+2019>t open on time or were experiencing other problems, said Kristen Clarke, executive director of the Lawyers<U+2019> Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law. Others came from would-be voters with registration issues, she said. <U+2014>Peter Loftus, Valerie Bauerlein and Tawnell D. Hobbs contributed to this article.

Citing persistent terrors threats and Spring elections scheduled that will come with many political rallies that could be targets for attacks, Mr. Hollande said his government will ask parliament to extend the year-old state of emergency. <U+201C>I want to extend the state of emergency until the presidential election,<U+201D> he said, during an interview with TV station France24. The first round of the French presidential election is scheduled for April 23, with the runoff round is set for May 4. The state of emergency was introduced in November 2015, after a series of terror attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The measure gives authorities far-reaching powers, including banning people from leaving their homes and conducting searches without a court order. The French authorities have extended the state of emergency several times since its implementation, as the country has been hit by other terror attacks, while police foiled many others. Still, the most recent debate in parliament was acrimonious, as many opposition legislators criticized how Mr. Hollande<U+2019>s socialist administration handled the situation. During the same interview, Mr. Hollande unveiled details of his conversation with U.S. president elect Donald Trump this past weekend. <U+201C>From the conversation I had, I understood (Mr. Trump) is in a phase of calming-down and collaboration with his partners,<U+201D> Mr. Hollande said, adding he expects the president elect to make clear his position on a series of issues, such as climate agreements, Iran, Syria and Ukraine. The French President also asked Mr. Trump for his position on the sanctions against Russia but said he got no answer. Write to Inti Landauro at inti.landauro@wsj.com",

Now, the biggest unknown hanging over the markets <U+2014> the outcome of the United States presidential election <U+2014> is about to be known. Nervousness over the election has been reflected in Wall Street<U+2019>s <U+201C>fear gauge,<U+201D> the index known as the Vix, which in recent weeks has been at its highest levels since the market turmoil in late June after Britain<U+2019>s vote to leave the European Union. When the presidential election is called, there is no guarantee how markets will react. But stocks, currencies and commodities have already provided clues as they fluctuated after major news events over the course of the campaigns. The first reaction will come in Asian trading early Wednesday, particularly in the value of the United States dollar against other currencies. A victory by Hillary Clinton has been largely priced in by investors. That was evident by what followed the decision on Oct. 28 by the F.B.I. director , James B. Comey, to update Congress on the status of the investigation into Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s emails. Stocks fell, and the benchmark Standard & Poor<U+2019>s 500-stock index closed lower for nine consecutive sessions for the first time since 1980. On Monday, after Mr. Comey<U+2019>s announcement that recently discovered emails warranted no further actions, the S.&P. rose 2.2 percent. Confirmation of what the market has expected is likely to produce a relief rally on Wednesday and a rise in the value of the dollar. Investors who have been sitting on cash in recent weeks may decide to pile into the market. Yet shares of drug companies and financial companies <U+2014> potential targets for regulation <U+2014> may not fare as well on news of a win by Mrs. Clinton. A victory by Donald J. Trump would come as more of a shock to investors. Barclays analysts have said they would expect a decline of as much as 13 percent in the S.&P. 500. Citigroup analysts say they would expect a drop of 3 to 5 percent. Investors would flee risky assets and seek out the relative safety of Treasury securities and the Swiss franc. The Mexican peso, whose value against the dollar this year has largely inversely tracked Mr. Trump<U+2019>s electoral prospects, would plummet. Yet as Andrew Ross Sorkin recently noted , after the immediate reaction, investors may find opportunities in a Trump victory, in shares of energy and health care companies among others.",

Those politicians who have devoted a substantial portion of their adult lives to the electoral arena (congressmen, governors, etc.) should have a significant say in who should be nominated for president. The superdelegate mechanism, however, suffers from the infirmity of potentially thwarting the will of the people (i.e., Republican primary voters). The only time superdelegates would make a difference is if they threw their support to a candidate who received fewer primary votes than another candidate for the nomination. What would the thwarted primary voters do in response? Many would simply not vote in the general election; many more would vote for the presidential nominee of the other party. The superdelegate concept could be counterproductive. The culprit that enabled Donald Trump to hijack the Republican presidential nomination is the winner-take-all primary. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s voter support throughout the 2016 primary season hovered around 35% to 40%<U+2014>significantly more than any other candidate, but clearly not a majority of Republican voters. Delegate allocation procedures are governed by state statute, not by federal law nor by the Republican National Committee (RNC). Hence, the RNC would have to exert some leverage on the states to minimize or eliminate the winner-take-all allocation of delegates. David Brady Cape Girardeau, Mo. Mr. Roberts writes that, <U+201C>If there hadn<U+2019>t been superdelegates in the Democratic Party, Bernie Sanders would be within a hair<U+2019>s breadth of the White House right now.<U+201D> Mr. Roberts seems to believe that would have been a bad thing. Most polling showed Sen. Sanders would have beaten Mr. Trump handily, so perhaps it is the result rather than the process that would have brought it about that Mr. Roberts objects to. The superdelegate system that blocked Sen. Sanders<U+2019>s candidacy is antidemocratic, so it<U+2019>s not clear why Mr. Roberts advocates its perpetuation as one of the cures for our ailing democracy. Joseph J. Saltarelli Wilton, Conn. Let<U+2019>s also bar crossover voting and require runoffs if no candidate gets a majority. The value of having superdelegates is debatable. Richard H. Shulman New York Our current duopoly guarantees that the two finalists get pulled to the extremes while middle-of-the-road voters have nobody to like. That is exactly what<U+2019>s wrong with 2016. The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates is much to blame for our dilemma since it has suppressed alternatives to the establishment picks. Despite the agreed shortcomings of the moderators, the presence of a centrist voice like Gary Johnson <U+2019>s would have transformed the discussion. John M. Rathbun Asheville, N.C. We are left with <U+201C>vulgar<U+201D> Mr. Trump because of the GOP itself and the political establishment in Washington. Republicans and conservative voters sent a loud and clear message in 2014 by giving the GOP a majority in the House and Senate. Elected Republicans were largely impotent in stopping President Obama<U+2019>s agenda and cowardly in avoiding votes on crucial legislation using presumptive presidential vetos as the excuse. The GOP has proved it deserved the diss by not supporting the candidate selected by its own process. I suggest that Mr. Trump be looked on as an attempted correction of the increasingly intrusive federal government in everyday life. Maybe we don<U+2019>t want another party loyalist at the helm. At the hands of political machinery we have seen the credibility of our major institutions<U+2014>the IRS, FBI, Supreme Court, HHS, EPA, Justice Department and the VA system<U+2014>tarnished. We have watched our health-care system be systematically sent into chaos with an unworkable law sold to the American people with purposeful deception. We are willing to take a chance on Donald Trump because we have faith in the basic structure of our system. As <U+201C>deplorables<U+201D> we yearn for something different than the last seven years. It isn<U+2019>t our government system that has failed us, but the people who are in it. Jane Lindell Hughes San Antonio I agree with Andrew Roberts that Republican Party leaders made a terrible mistake when they failed to confront Donald Trump early on and instead decided to <U+201C>coddle him in the vain hope that if you<U+2019>re nice you inherit his supporters when he collapses.<U+201D> It seems those leaders were (and apparently still are) less interested in their vaunted principles than in victory for the sake of victory.

A few of my readers had criticized me for suggesting that Trump might lose, but I don<U+2019>t know who is going to win the election, and so all I had to go on was the cold, hard numbers. And a couple of weeks ago the cold, hard numbers were telling me that Hillary Clinton was going to win. Of course it is entirely possible that the national polls might have been seriously wrong, but even the state polls in the most important battleground states consistently had bad news for Trump. So things didn<U+2019>t look good for Trump at the time, but now that the FBI has renewed their investigation into Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s emails the poll numbers have shifted dramatically in Trump<U+2019>s favor. As I write this article, the national polls have really tightened up. In fact, the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll puts Trump 1 point ahead of Clinton. Trump has all of the momentum at the moment, but that does not mean that he is going to win. As we have seen already in this race, one day can literally change everything. And as I noted yesterday, more than 23 million Americans have already voted, and most of that voting was done during a period of time when Hillary Clinton was doing very well in the polls. So we shall see what happens. But if Trump does win on November 8th, there is a fact about his birthday which will start to get a lot of attention. Donald Trump was born on June 14th, 1946. If you move ahead 70 years from that date, that brings you to June 14th, 2016. Moving forward another 7 months brings you to January 14th, 2017, and moving forward another 7 days brings you to January 21st, 2017. And if Donald Trump wins the election, January 21st will be his first full day in office. Of course Trump would be inaugurated on January 20th, but he would only be president for part of that day. So that means that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day as president of the United States. And this would happen during year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar. These amazing <U+201C>coincidences<U+201D> were first pointed out on Facebook by a user named Alyson Kelly. Some may take these numbers as a sign that Donald Trump is supposed to become the next president, but I want to make it exceedingly clear that I do not know what is going to happen, nor am I making any sort of prediction about what is going to happen. I just thought that this information was <U+201C>interesting<U+201D> and so I thought that I would share it. Someone that does believe that Trump is going to win is Glenn Beck. He was been virulently anti-Trump throughout this campaign, but now he is convinced that Clinton will be unable to overcome this new email scandal, and he is calling this renewed investigation by the FBI <U+201C>the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America.<U+201D> Beck also says that if Clinton wins now it will be evidence that <U+201C>magic exists<U+201D>, and he is currently projecting that Trump should win the national vote by 5 points <U+2026> <U+201C>Let<U+2019>s just say he was 8 points, that was fair to say, 8 points behind last week,<U+201D> Beck said, according to a transcript posted on his website . <U+201C>He should win by 5 points.<U+201D> Beck later added: <U+201C>How can the next president face a possible collapsing economy, possible war with Russia, and a current war with ISIS? Oh, and also, be under FBI investigation and indictment? Can<U+2019>t. Can<U+2019>t.<U+201D> The conservative personality called the latest FBI revelation <U+201C>the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America<U+201D> and added that if Clinton still managed to win, it would be akin to proof <U+201C>magic exists.<U+201D> Hopefully Glenn Beck is right, because none of us should want to see Hillary Clinton in the White House. She is the most evil, corrupt and scandal-ridden politician of this generation, and I can<U+2019>t understand how any American in their right mind could possibly vote for her. And the hits just keep on coming. Wikileaks has just released an email in which John Podesta told Clinton <U+201C>fixer<U+201D> Cheryl Mills that they were <U+201C>going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later<U+201D> <U+2026> It was not entirely clear what Podesta meant by that phrase, but it could potentially be smoking gun evidence of obstruction of justice. Back in 2008, Barack Obama was new, intriguing and mysterious. We didn<U+2019>t know a lot about him, and so one can almost understand how the American people could have been fooled by him. But in 2016, Americans know more about Hillary Clinton than they have ever known about any candidate in modern American history. The Clintons have a history of crimes and scandals that goes all the way back to the 1980s, but about half the country is choosing to ignore all of that history and vote for her anyway. I believe that this election is America<U+2019>s final exam. Originally there were 17 Republicans and 5 Democrats running for the presidency. When you throw in the major third party candidates, that brings us to a total of approximately 25 people that the American public could have chosen from. If the American people willingly choose the most wicked candidate out of all of them after everything that has been revealed, I don<U+2019>t think that anyone will be able to say that we don<U+2019>t deserve the bitter consequences that follow that decision. The time for talking is almost over, and shortly we shall find out which path the American people have chosen. If that choice turns out to be Hillary Clinton after everything that we have seen during this election cycle, I truly believe that we will have reached the point of no return as a nation. source:",

The Minnesota congressman and Bernie Sanders ally is facing growing resistance to the idea of electing another party chairman who is a sitting member of Congress. On the heels of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz<U+2019>s troubled tenure as DNC chief, the issue of whether Ellison will commit full-time to the job poses a threat to his candidacy <U+2014> even as he enjoys significant support in his bid to become DNC chairman. Story Continued Below Wasserman Schultz drew criticism in party circles for how she handled the two demanding roles, and Democrats privately grumbled that she sought to leverage her position as party chairman to give her congressional donors plum spots at DNC fundraisers with President Barack Obama and solicited DNC donors for contributions to her campaign. <U+201C>I think we all watched at DNC meetings a chair trying to do both, and both is a matter of the amount of time being taken but also, if you are a sitting officeholder, there's potentially some separation between your interests and the interests of the national party,\" said Ohio Democratic Party chairman David Pepper. Already, two of Ellison<U+2019>s opponents for the top DNC job <U+2014> former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean and South Carolina Democratic Party chairman Jaime Harrison <U+2014> have made the point that congressional responsibilities would dramatically undercut the ability of the next chairman to do the job effectively. By Daniel Strauss \"Look, I like Keith Ellison a lot. He's a very good guy. There's one problem. You cannot do this job and sit in a political office at the same time. It's not possible,\" Dean, a former DNC chairman, said during a Nov. 11 interview on MSNBC. In announcing his bid for chair last week, Harrison made clear he would quit his lobbying job if he won the DNC race. On Thursday, he stressed that the next DNC chairman has to be a full-timer. \"Anybody that understands what has to be done right now to rebuild the Democratic Party understands that you can't do part-time. You can't do quarter-time, you can't do half-time. It has to be a full-time commitment, or I just don't see how it works,\" Harrison said. Ellison has not publicly addressed the issue and so far has given no indication that he would step down from Congress if he were elected to the chairmanship. \"He's fully committed to doing both jobs. He's ready to step down from his leadership post and as co-chair on Day One. People have confidence in his capabilities. That's why he has so much support,\" a source with direct knowledge of Ellison's thinking said when asked whether Ellison would step down from his House seat if elected. Ellison currently serves as a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and as a chief deputy whip for House Democrats. But that may not be enough to allay Democratic worries, with some pointing to the national party<U+2019>s charter and by-laws, which state that the \"National Chairperson shall serve full-time.\" Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, who is up for reelection in 2018, said last week that <U+201C>the DNC head ought to be full-time,\" though he refused to answer followups on the race or who he's supporting. Ilyse Hogue, president of the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America, is considering a run for the DNC post and also thinks the position should be full-time, according to a spokeswoman. Last weekend, Assistant House Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn of South Carolina sent a letter to House Democrats arguing that the next chairman needs to be engaged on a full-time basis. \"The Democratic National Committee's (DNC) primary goal is to win the presidency,\" the letter, obtained by POLITICO, said. \"Winning the presidency in 2020 is possible. But it will require, in our not-so-humble opinion, a 24/7 bottom-to-top rebuilding effort.\" Clyburn, who backs Harrison for chairman, sent the letter before Harrison jumped into the race. On Wednesday, Clyburn told his fellow Congressional Black Caucus members that he would be making the same argument regardless of whether he supported Harrison, who is a former Clyburn aide. \"He told the Black Caucus today that they are unrelated, and Clyburn's the type of person who would shoot straight,\" said CBC Chairman Rep. G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, who's open to either Harrison or Ellison becoming chairman. On Friday, another South Carolinian, former DNC chairman Don Fowler, emailed current DNC members to press the case. \"We must have a fulltime Chair who will devote all of her/his time and energy to electing Democrats in the midterm election of 2018 and retaking the White House in 2020,\" Fowler wrote, stressing that that he was not endorsing any candidate in the race. \"A part time Chair simply cannot get it done. Please join me in insisting upon following our Charter and electing a fulltime Chair for the next four years.\" One option that could accommodate Ellison is a dual-chairman structure. \"It's been done multiple times. Having done it, I think it would work successfully,\" said former DNC chairman Steve Grossman, who co-chaired the committee with then-Colorado Gov. Roy Romer. Congress By Darren Samuelsohn But many Democrats are leery of the idea. Even when they assumed that the party would inherit the White House in 2016, the dual-chairman scenario was viewed askance by some top officials. An internal Hillary Clinton campaign memo released in a WikiLeaks batch of campaign chairman John Podesta's emails showed campaign officials warning of a \"Two-headed monster with little clarity of who is responsible for different areas of work within the committee.\" While Grossman saw merit in a dual chair set-up, he cautioned that a single chairman, especially when the party is out of power, would have to be full-time. \"I think it is a big mistake for the Democratic Party to choose one person to be the chairman of the party unless that person is prepared to make it a full-time job. It is too big, too complex, it is too all-encompassing and consuming.\" Ellison's backers strongly disagree with that argument. Rep. Ra<U+00FA>l Grijalva, an Ellison supporter, insisted Friday the previous problem wasn<U+2019>t that Wasserman Schultz was a member of Congress, it was that she didn't balance the two roles properly. \"Well, she had two hats, and the conflicts with those hats got her in trouble. I don't think Keith has conflict,\" Grijalva said. Ellison<U+2019>s position is bolstered by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who offered his unqualified support Thursday and said the solution is for the next chairman to bring in capable staff. The Minnesota congressman has already brought on Nick Carter, formerly in charge of delegate math for Sanders' presidential campaign, to help his bid. \"Look, I think it's no secret I'll tell you I think Debbie Wasserman Schultz was not an outstanding chair of the Democratic Party, but it wasn't because she was a sitting member of Congress, and I think we have a lot of precedent in the past for DNC leaders to be governors, to be full-time public officials,\" Sanders told reporters. \"On the other hand, the argument is a valid argument that is especially now it is a very time-consuming job. But the way you deal with that is to have the kind of staff that you need, to have an executive director that you need to handle a whole lot of executive work that needs to be done.\" The real reason it's being discussed, Sanders added, is because it's a way for Ellison's critics to undermine his candidacy. \"I don't believe it was being raised when Debbie took the job. And I think this is just a way for Keith's opponents <U+2014> I mean, the usual line is, 'We love Keith, he's great, but,' and that's the <U+2018>but.<U+2019> So I think this is a way for his opponents to try to criticize him and end up supporting somebody else,\" he said.

Is \"Full Spectrum Dominance\", the Pentagon's ambitious plan to have military control over the land, sea, air and outer space, a mirage? Question #2. Has the plan been effectively neutralized by Russia's advanced technology in missile defense systems and superior early warning detection capability? Reading Pepe Escobar's latest, \"Russia Calls the War Party's Bluff\" [1] , he doesn't refer directly to the Pentagon's plan to exercise \"Full Spectrum Dominance\" yet he does mention the S-500 anti-missile system effectively seals Russia's air space . Escobar quoting a US intel source, \"The United States has lost the arms race, indulging in trillions of dollars of worthless wars...no longer a global power as it cannot defend itself with its obsolete missiles, THAAD, Patriot, and Aegis Land Based Ballistic Defense System, against Russian ICBM's, even as the Russian's have sealed their air space. The Russian's may be as much as four generations ahead of the US\". Hmm...\"Full Spectrum Dominance\"? Back to that in a bit. Escobar's primary focus is on Syria and the Russian S-300, 400 missile systems brought to Syria now operational on land and sea which he says, \"Russia has basically made their own no-fly zone over Syria; and a US no-fly zone is now impossible to achieve\". That effectively neutralizes any future plans the Obama administration has in mind as well as a new Hillary Clinton regime in waiting contemplating such an idea; something she's been pushing during the presidential campaign against Trump. This much seems clear. Russian President Vladimir Putin has chosen to make a stand militarily and diplomatically -the latter shouldn't be forgotten-to support Syrian President Bashar Assad's government against the assorted Pentagon, CIA, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, GCC backed proxy mercenary jihadist terrorists trained and supported by them then brought to Syria to bring about regime change. - Advertisement - With Russia entrenched in Syria regime change isn't going to happen. The current siege against the terrorists by Assad's Syrian Arab Army supported by Russian air power in eastern Aleppo continues. Meanwhile over the border in Mosul, Iraq a battle is raging to extricate IS terrorists that have controlled the city since 2014 when it routed the Iraqi army. Now an unlikely conglomeration of Shiite militia's, Sunni tribesmen, Peshmerga Kurds, Turkish army, Iraqi army, US special forces supported by US planes are besieging the city. In all likelihood when IS loses control of Mosul its remaining forces will retreat into eastern Syria becoming a new force presumably used by the US as the newest proxy force to take on Assad. This hasn't occurred yet so the focus by Assad's SAA forces is retaking and freeing the Syrian people in besieged Eastern Aleppo. Back to the original premise of this piece, the Pentagon's Full Spectrum Dominance, FSD. Nothing is really secret anymore. - Advertisement - Russia and China had to know the Pentagon's FSD plan from its inception. They had to know it was mandatory to develop and upgrade their ballistic missile technology to effectively neutralize any US plan to initiate a nuclear first strike-something that's still on the table while Russia and China have rejected the idea. Regrettably, we're in a new cold war with Russia and China. And despite some fiery rhetoric from Hillary Clinton, \"Putin's the new Hitler, wanting a no-fly zone over Syria\" and her generalized disposition to show how tough she is, there should be enough reality based resistance coming from the military, intel agencies that should short circuit any aggressive moves she has in mind that would bring any direct confrontation with Russia and China, whether in Syria, Ukraine, the South China Sea or anywhere else that could escalate into a nuclear confrontation. In conclusion the madness of initiating a nuclear first strike against Russia and China is being effectively neutralized by Russian ABM, ICBM superiority now evidenced in Syria making the Pentagon's Full Spectrum Dominance a mirage, including for Hillary \"mad dog\" Clinton.",

The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. \nBack in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country<U+2019>s dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for <U+201C>regime change<U+201D> in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \nFor our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? \nThe short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. \nBut the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government<U+2019>s payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. \nWhat we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. \nSo the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. \nOn March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. \nSocial and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? \nThe various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out <U+2013> specifically, how to tell when they are getting <U+201C>true<U+201D> intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need <U+201C> help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. <U+201D> To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. \nA <U+201C>partnership<U+201D> is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a <U+201C> permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board<U+201D> to coordinate programs in <U+201C>social and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .<U+201D> \nDespite this effort, it is almost certain that the <U+201C>social and behavioral sciences<U+201D> cannot give the spy agencies what they want <U+2013> a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. \nThe Believers \nIt is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth <U+2013> that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (right) talks with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, with John Brennan and other national security aides present. (Photo credit: Office of Director of National Intelligence) \nTherefore, if someone feeds them <U+201C>snake oil,<U+201D> they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors <U+2013> those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview <U+2013> have different criterion for what is <U+201C>true<U+201D> than do the analysts. \nListen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council <U+2013> yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, <U+201C> We<U+2019>re looking for truth. But we<U+2019>re particularly looking for truth that works. <U+201D> Now what might that mean? \nI can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, <U+201C>truth<U+201D> must match up, fit with, their worldview <U+2013> their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not <U+201C>work.<U+201D> So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by <U+201C>group think,<U+201D> ideological blinkers, and a <U+201C>we know better<U+201D> attitude. \nOn the other hand, as long as what you<U+2019>re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory <U+2013> the list is almost endless. \nWhat does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers <U+2013> the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class <U+2013> presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. \nIt has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeare<U+2019>s determination that <U+201C>what is past, is prelude.<U+201D> Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will <U+2013> no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power. Hope springs eternal.",

Yes, Hillary Clinton may be all that stands between us and the apocalypse. And as she says, <U+201C>We face some hard choices.<U+201D> However, her rhetoric comes across either as the obtuse promises we<U+2019>ve heard before or as personal attacks on Trump that aren<U+2019>t effective.

To prevent the release of the Kraken known as Trump, I would advise Clinton that we didn<U+2019>t get to where we are solely thanks to Republicans. Democrats share the blame. Therefore, a little contrition would be a good way to start her conversation with the electorate. That would add much to her credibility, the lack of which is her biggest liability. Karen Hartman, Douglas, Mich. Is there any doubt that Hillary Clinton is the most vilified public figure of this still-young century? One national network has a mission to destroy her. The right-wing-conspiracy-driven social-media ecosystem hates her, as do many members of Congress and a wide swath of the population. Is it any wonder that she is a private person in a public role? Can anyone really blame her or hold it against Clinton to shrink in a defensive crouch when her opponent asserts she is a devil whom he would throw in jail? I, for one, conclude that Trump was spot on about Clinton: She fights hard, she doesn<U+2019>t quit and she doesn<U+2019>t give up. Are not those the qualities of a leader? Forget her less-than-sizzling persona. Ignore the lingering tides of sexism still awash in the country. Hillary Rodham Clinton has absolutely been through the gantlet of public and personal challenges unlike any other public figure in my lifetime. I will enthusiastically cast my vote for her next month. Paul Bernish, Cincinnati, Ohio RE: ADDERALL Casey Schwartz details her use of prescription stimulants to get through school and to start her career <U+2014> and her struggle to stop. Casey Schwartz<U+2019>s very readable article details her experience with prescription-drug abuse and addiction and her hard-won struggle to break free. But her personal tale of fall and redemption leaves behind a different Generation Adderall: the sort of kid she herself used to tutor in Los Angeles, who may have been prescribed the drug as a last resort in order to function in society <U+2014> i.e., in school <U+2014> by following rules and lesson plans and without disrupting those around them. As Schwartz suggests in her piece, research on the long-term effects of extended use of prescription amphetamines is sadly insufficient and inconclusive. And that research is imperative for the health and safety of the children who have taken the drug for years, every morning according to a prescribed dosage, and who may need to learn to live with Adderall, or its future equivalents, indefinitely <U+2014> in order to continue to hear music of their own. Elisa Isaacson, Albany, Calif. Casey Schwartz<U+2019>s punchy, engrossing narrative about the experience of trying and becoming addicted to Adderall illuminates a conclusion that should surprise no one: Diversion of medication to patients who have not been diagnosed properly never turns out well. Sadly, years after her foray into abusing Adderall, a psychiatrist <U+201C>legitimized<U+201D> Schwartz<U+2019>s addiction by doing a hasty job of evaluating her, apparently offering no counseling or education about A.D.H.D. Instead, she was sent on her way to more stimulant misuse and trouble, apparently without any follow-up appointments being required by the prescribing physician. Although she claims that she faked her inattentive symptoms to secure her script for Adderall, it could be that Schwartz did and does in fact have a milder, subclinical form of A.D.H.D., given what appears to be a history of repeated problems with procrastination and inconsistent effort, particularly during college. If so, medication judiciously taken and monitored, and used in concert with other supports (psychotherapy, executive-function coaching, proper levels of exercise and sleep), might have prevented her from becoming swept up in the ravages of addiction. Instead, proper diagnosis and treatment might have allowed her to function fully and well during her 20-something years. Frances C. Sutherland, Ph.D., Bryn Mawr, Pa.

The recent rise of antitrade political forces around the world, particularly in the U.S. where Donald Trump won the Republican presidential nomination on a protectionist platform, has worried finance ministers and central bankers assembled here for the fall meetings of the International Monetary Fund. That concern is particularly acute in Mexico, where exports account for about 35% of the economy. Mr. Trump has threatened to pull the U.S. out of the North American Free Trade Agreement if elected, ending a 22-year-old trade pact that has helped open up the Mexican economy. <U+201C>Mexico is integral to the North American story,<U+201D> Mr. Meade said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on the sidelines of the meetings. Imposing trade restrictions in the U.S. <U+201C>would not be consistent with strengthening either of our economies.<U+201D> U.S.-Mexico trade has evolved significantly since the early days of Nafta, Mr. Meade said. Rather than trading finished goods, North American countries now move products across borders multiple times before they are ready for their final sale. <U+201C>Every time Mexico exports a dollar, 40 cents of it comes out of goods produced within the U.S.,<U+201D> he said. That is particularly true with airplanes, he said. <U+201C>You have turbines made in Mexico that are assembled here [in the U.S.] using Canadian elements,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Every time a plane is sold, the components that are part of that plane come from the three countries. So if any one of the three is successful in gaining market share elsewhere in the world, that means that all three of us are successful.<U+201D> Mr. Meade said the Mexican government has been closely following the presidential election campaign in the U.S., though he didn<U+2019>t directly discuss Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign. Mr. Meade was appointed to his current position last month after his predecessor, Luis Videgaray, resigned after being blamed for organizing Mr. Trump<U+2019>s<U+00A0>Aug. 31<U+00A0>visit to Mexico that was widely considered a disaster in the country. <U+201C>If you look at the elements of the relationship there<U+2019>s no single aspect of the value of the relationship where Mexico does not play a significant role in the U.S. and where the U.S. does not play a significant role in Mexico,<U+201D> he said. As part of its effort to broaden its global reach, Mexico has spent the past few years trying to wean itself off oil exports as a major economic driver. Oil accounted for 6% of the country<U+2019>s exports in 2015, down from 14% in 2012. On the fiscal side, Mr. Meade said the government of President<U+00A0>Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto<U+00A0>had tried to expand value added, income and excise taxes. The government has also sought to attract more investment by making regulatory changes affecting the telecommunications and energy industries. <U+201C>The thing that keeps us up at night is how do we make Mexico more resilient to whatever is out there,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We face a lot of uncertainty. And with Mexico becoming more global and in general the global economy becoming more interconnected, the challenge for a country like Mexico is how we can deal with resilience in our economy to deal with whatever the next big thing is.<U+201D>",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Guest Post \n source: thesleuthjournal.com \n text: By: The Voice of Reason | In recent weeks, a common theme that has run through the vast majority of the stories I<U+2019>ve covered, has been for people to make sure they are preparing for the possibility of a major emergency. Why? First and foremost, because it was only back in May when President Obama took time out of his extremely busy schedule to deliver an address at the FEMA National Response Coordination Center in Washington where he made a point to stress that Americans who are not preparing for disaster, or who do not have emergency evacuation plans for any given scenario, could find themselves in big trouble in the near future. The following excerpt from Obama<U+2019>s speech comes directly from the official White House website <U+2026> <U+201C>One of the things that we have learned over the course of the last seven and a half years is that government plays a vital role, but it is every citizen<U+2019>s responsibility to be prepared for a disaster. And that means taking proactive steps, like having an evacuation plan, having a fully stocked disaster supply kit. If your local authorities ask you to evacuate, you have to do it. Don<U+2019>t wait.<U+201D> That<U+2019>s the biggest reason why. Second, all one has to do is look around at our surroundings to see that right now the <U+201C>perfect storm<U+201D> of pure chaos is brewing all around us. As our allies in Berlin who have nuclear missiles pointed in their direction by the Russians can attest to, Geopolitical tensions are sky right now. German leaders, along with leaders in the Czeck Republic have issued warnings to their people to begin stockpiling food and emergency supplies in case of what could be an <U+201C>existence threatening event.<U+201D> Not helping matters geopolitically is the fact that the entire financial banking system of the West which includes the U.S. Dollar as the World Reserve Currency was built as a debt-based monetary system, and now that the debt saturation process has run its full course, the global economy is on the verge of what is being called a <U+201C>global reset,<U+201D> which could occur at any moment. Lastly, here domestically the 2016 presidential election has gotten so divisive, that supporters from both political parties have vowed not to accept the winner if it<U+2019>s not their candidate, and some groups have even promised the largest civil uprising in our nation<U+2019>s history if the election doesn<U+2019>t go their way. If that was all that was in the news, it would be enough to put anyone on edge. What I talk about in the video below, is a recent article from earlier this week from The Daily Caller . In that article, among other things, it reports that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford has had to issue a reminder/warning to the troops to stay committed to their oaths, as well as the chain of command in the coming weeks. In light of everything I<U+2019>ve been warning people of, this recent report is most troubling<U+2026> The Daily Caller Reports: Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford wrote a Medium blog post Monday to remain committed to its military oath amid the 2016 election. <U+201C>What we must collectively guard against is allowing our institution to become politicized, or even perceived as being politicized, by how we conduct ourselves during engagements with the media, the public, or in open or social forums,<U+201D> Dunford reminded troops. Dunford further urged service members that the military must remain committed to the chain of command structure until the next administration comes in, and that the military should not undermine its credibility in the interim with the next president. <U+201C>I have a duty to protect the integrity and political neutrality of our military profession,<U+201D> he continued. Dunford<U+2019>s comments also come amid increased concern that the U.S. military is becoming too politicized. He is reportedly furious with Retired Marine Gen. John Allen and Retired Army Gen. Michael Flynn for actively campaigning on behalf of the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey openly rebuked Allen and Flynn for injecting themselves into the political process. <U+201C>The American people should not wonder where their military leaders draw the line between military advice and political preference,<U+201D> he lamented in a letter to The Washington Post. He continued <U+201C>our nation<U+2019>s soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines should not wonder about the political leanings and motivations of their leaders.<U+201D> The letter is also likely addressing recent political statements by active duty service members on social media. A female sailor posted a video of herself sitting through morning colors in protest of supposed racism in the national anthem in August. The protest video was inspired by 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. THE VOICE OF REASON is the pen name of Michael DePinto, a graduate of Capital University Law School, and an attorney in Florida. Having worked in the World Trade Center, along with other family and friends, Michael was baptized by fire into the world of politics on September 11, 2001.

Halloween, therefore, means Holy Evening or the Evening of the Hallowed or Holy Ones, i.e., the Evening of the Saints. \nIn other words, Halloween is the evening before All Saints Day, which is today! \nThen I saw another angel come up from the East, holding the seal of the living God. He cried out in a loud voice to the four angels who were given power to damage the land and the sea, <U+201C>Do not damage the land or the sea or the trees until we put the seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.<U+201D> I heard the number of those who had been marked with the seal, one hundred and forty-four thousand marked from every tribe of the Israelites.<U+201D> Rev. 7:2-4 \nAfter this I had a vision of a great multitude, which no one could count, from every nation, race, people, and tongue. They stood before the throne and before the Lamb, wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands. They cried out in a loud voice: <U+201C>Salvation comes from our God, who is seated on the throne, and from the Lamb.<U+201D> All the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They prostrated themselves before the throne, worshiped God, and exclaimed: \n<U+201C>Amen. Blessing and glory, wisdom and thanksgiving, honor, power and might be to our God forever and ever. Amen.<U+201D> \nThen one of the elders spoke up and said to me, <U+201C>Who are these wearing white robes, and where did they come from?<U+201D> I said to him, <U+201C>My Lord, you are the one who knows.<U+201D> He said to me, <U+201C>These are the ones who have survived the time of great distress; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.<U+201D> Rev. 7:9-14. \n<U+201C>For this reason they stand before God<U+2019>s throne and worship him day and night in his temple. The one who sits on the throne will shelter them. They will not hunger or thirst anymore, nor will the sun or any heat strike them. For the Lamb who is in the center of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to springs of life- giving water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.<U+201D> Rev. 7:15-17. \nThrough the <U+201C>communion of saints,<U+201D> a doctrine proclaimed in the Apostle<U+2019>s Creed, the blessed in heaven assist those of us on earth; we pray with the saints so that they may intercede on our behalf before Our Lord. Remember, these incredible, courageous and wonderful individuals see God face to face! How cool is that? \nIndeed, they are the ultimate role models, heroes and heroines-people who chose to do extraordinary things and behaved always with serving Our Lord as their first priority in their lives, no matter what the cost. They were no different as human beings than we are, with faults, talents, proclivities towards temptation and bearing all qualities incident to human beings. What made them different were their choices, to serve God first above anything and everything. To put it more eloquently were the words of St. Thomas More on the day he was beheaded, wherein he stated, <U+201C>I am the King<U+2019>s good servant, but God<U+2019>s first.<U+201D> \nIn the communion of saints, <U+201C>a perennial link of charity exists between the faithful who have already reached their heavenly home and those of us who are still pilgrims on earth.<U+201D> (CCC 1475) \nSt. Thomas More said this about the saints. <U+201C>We venerate the saints as God<U+2019>s servants, as we would on earth welcome the servants of a great man we esteemed. If the goodness we bestow upon our poor brethren is considered by Christ as bestowed upon Himself, as He tells us (Mt 25:40), and if those, as He says, who welcome His apostles and disciples welcome Him (Mt. 10:40), assuredly those who honor the saints are likewise honoring Christ. Our Lord Himself showed that He would have His saints partake in His glory when He promised the apostles that they would be seated at His side on the final Day of Judgment (Mt. 19:28). Moreover, He promised that Martha<U+2019>s sister Mary (whom More identified as Mary Magdalen) would be honored throughout the world for her deed of anointing Him with ointment (Mt. 26:13).<U+201D> \nAs to honoring the saints, and our desire to request their advocacy and intercession on our behalf, as to whether or not the saints can either hear us or help us, St. Thomas More provided, <U+201C>Yet how can we doubt whether they hear us? Their souls are not dead, and therefore as living souls the love and charity toward their fellowman that characterized them to this world cannot have diminished in the next. The closer one draws to heaven, the greater is his solicitude toward his brethren here on earth, as was the case with the martyr Saint Stephen, who after seeing heaven opened, prayed for his enemies who were stoning him (Acts 7:55-60). In view of this, is it conceivable that Saint Stephen would not pray for those who honor him on earth, now that he is in heaven?<U+201D> And the question is further posed, how can the saints in heaven help us? More reasoned that since <U+201C>the saints were certainly able to assist others while on earth where their human nature was as weak as ours, surely they can do so in heaven.<U+201D> \nMore further reasoned that even while Our Lord lived on this earth, He permitted people to come to His apostles rather than directly to Himself for help and allowed the Twelve to work miracles in His stead. Indeed, on some occasions the apostles assumed the role of intercessors with Christ, presenting the petitions of others to their Master. <U+201C>If this was the case when the apostles were with Christ on earth, it must surely be so now that they dwell with Him in heaven. God is pleased to have us honor and call upon His saints, His especial beloved friends, for it becometh us and well behoveth us to make friends of such as he hath in favour.<U+201D> \nHave not you ever asked someone, <U+201C>Please pray for my mother, she is very ill,<U+201D> or <U+201C>Please pray for me; I am about to make a very important decision that will affect my life.<U+201D> Indeed and in fact, we have set forth these petitions to others on FOTM . Ergo, we pray with the Saints, inhabitants of the Church Triumphant, for their intercession, for their guidance that they receive from Our Lord Himself. If we ask those we know on earth for their advocacy and prayers, all the more reason to ask the Church Triumphant to enter our lives, to give us direction and to ask through them the Grace from God necessary to live our lives according to the Will of God, to the fullest extent, using all of our talents and gifts given to us by God. The Saints are with us; we are foolish not to have camaraderie with them and to enjoy intimate and meaningful relationships. \nWe end this post by honoring the particular Saints in our respective lives who have inspired and helped us: St. Michael the Archangel , St. Paul , the Virgin Mary , St. Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se the Little Flower, St. Joseph, St. Thomas Aquinas and my patient and wonderful guardian angel ~ from Eowyn. \nWe love you, we admire you, and we thank you! \nMay Our Lord Always Be First Served! \nFor the Saint posts we<U+2019>ve published, go to FOTM<U+2019>s <U+201C> Saints and Angels <U+201D> page! \nSources: Catechism of the Catholic Church .

They are, however, the first to blame for the outcome of the US presidential elections. Their candidate, Hillary Clinton, was the embodiment of a totally corrupt political system. She is a hypocrite par excellence, talking to the bankiers of Wall Street behind closed doors differently than to the American people. Her rhetoric for the rights of women and blacks and other minorities sounded disingenuous. The Clinton Foundation received large donations from Saudi-Arabia and Qatar, countries rewarded in return by huge arms transfers overseen by her as Secretary of State. Her involvement in this corruption was no theme for the media. According to emails published by WikiLeaks, her campaign manager John Podesta was or is on the payroll of the Saudis. All of this was not considered worth reporting by the media. Virtually all national media in the United States supported Clinton's candidacy. Instead of reporting how the machinery of the Democratic Party and the Clinton team stole the primary elections to prevent the candidacy of Bernie Sanders, the media demonized Donald Trump.\nI do not wish here to defend Donald Trump. He made numerous stupid, racist, sexist, and anti-Islamic statements that were rightly criticized. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, was treated with kid gloves while her huge criminal political record was glossed over. Instead of coming to grips with their abject failures, the liberals and their media continue in slandering Donald Trump. Trump<U+2019>s first declarations show already that he has conquered new frontiers.\nAn American President is not a free and politically independent person. From day one, a President-elect can't anymore go around the corner and grab a hot dog or a hamburger. He is reigned in by a military and security establishment that holds the President fit for public consumption. Trump, as any other president, can be expected to follow their rule and political suggestions.\nI doubt very much that Trump will keep the promises of his election campaign, such as building a wall along the American-Mexican border, deport all illegal immigrants or ban Muslims from immigrating into the US. I even doubt that he will go after Hillary Clinton and her husband's dubious foundation. There exists a code of honor among thieves.\nTrump won precisely because of the shrill one-sided media propaganda and because of his rhetoric against the Washington establishment, including his own Republican Party. Now, this Republican establishment dominates both houses of Congress. Trump belongs also, however, to the US establishment but of another sort. Nobody should believe that the Washington establishment will follow Trump's lead. Even his positive statements about Vladimir Putin or his suggestion to discard NATO, will probably vanish. But what I do hope is that he stands to his rejection of TPP and TTIP and his pragmatic view of Vladimir Putin.\nMORE... Ann Garrison: Clinton Serves the Interests of the Oligarchy that She Herself Has Joined Top Aide to Hillary Clinton Urges the FBI to Disclose what it Knows about Trump's Russia Ties What will Hillary Clinton do for India? Not Much and Here's Why Clinton's Policies Look Like a Death Sentence for Americans Whether Trump will stop American adventurism in the Middle East has to be seen. His close ties with Netanyahu do not bode well for the Palestinians. He sees Zionist colonization of the rest of Palestine as no hindrance to peace. And while he has promised to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, I doubt that he will carry out this provocation against international law and the entire Muslim world.\nThe German political and media class was not only surprised by the results of the US elections, but did not even try to hide its revulsion against the choice of the American people. The entire political class in Germany perceived and presented the Trump campaign in the same one-sided manner as American media did. Chancellor Angela Merkel sent the President-Elect Trump a warning in the guise of a congratulation. Her political impudence was garbed within obsequious blabber about the allegedly honorable nature of German-American ties: \"Germany and America are bound by common values <U+2014> democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin color, creed, gender, sexual orientation, or political views. It is based on these values that I wish to offer close cooperation, both with me personally and between our countries<U+2019> governments.<U+201D> Other German politicians did not even attempt to hide their disdain for American voters by diplomatic language. Germany<U+2019>s Foreign Minister Steinmeier called Trump a \"preacher of hate\", and Deputy Chancellor Gabriel cartooned Trump as a <U+201C>trailblazer of a new authoritarian and chauvinist international movement... [who wants] a rollback to the bad old times in which women belonged by the stove or in bed, gays in jail and unions at best at the side table.<U+201D> During the election campaign, Trump called Merkel's mass-immigration policy \"insane\" and <U+201C>what Merkel did to Germany<U+201D> a <U+201C>sad shame<U+201D>.\nThe media and the political class should at this point stop pontificating. Their double morals and unprofessional coverage of the US elections should prompt them to more humility. They should rather blame themselves for their biased reporting, which led directly to Clinton's defeat. Ordinary Americans are not as stupid as the Establishment wants us to believe. Established parties and media would be well advised to give the new US President a chance to prove his worth. There will be, without doubt, many occasions in the future for fact-based criticism.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Michael Greger M.D. FACLM \n source: nutritionfacts.org \n text: Spin Doctors <U+2013> How the Media Reports on Medicine \n  \nIn a study of the dietary advice given by newspapers in the UK, <U+201C>no credible scientific basis<U+201D> was found for most claims. The <U+201C>[m]isreporting of dietary advice<U+201D> was found to be <U+201C>widespread and may contribute to public misconceptions about food and health.<U+201D> And, potentially, not just the public. \nScientists like to think they<U+2019>re not influenced by popular media, but this study decided to put that to the test. Each week, The New York Times reports on scientific research, and the studies they report on end up being cited more often than those they don<U+2019>t report on. Ah, so, the popular press does have an impact. \nNot so fast. That<U+2019>s just one potential explanation. Maybe, outstanding articles are both more likely to be picked up by media, and independently more likely to be cited. Maybe, the newspaper was just earmarking important science, and their publicity didn<U+2019>t really have any effect on future studies. \nHow could you disentangle the two? An event in 1978 made it possible. There was a three-month strike, in which they continued to print copies, but could not sell them to the public. So, a natural experiment was set up. If the paper was just earmarking important articles, then the strike would have no effect on the studies<U+2019> impact. But, that<U+2019>s not what happened. The studies highlighted during the strike months, when no one could read them, appeared to have no impact. \nThe next question, of course, is: are they just amplifying the medical information to the medical community, or distorting it, as well? \nSystematic studies suggest that many stories about new medicines, for example, tend to overstate benefits, understate risks and costs, and fail to disclose relevant financial ties. Overly rosy coverage of drugs may also result from financial ties between drug companies and the journalists themselves, who may be susceptible to Big Pharma perks. \nScientists and physicians often blame the press. In fact, the famous physician William Osler was quoted as saying, <U+201C>Believe nothing that you see in the newspapers<U+201D> and <U+201C>If you see anything in them that you know is true, begin to doubt it at once.<U+201D> \nBut, both parties share in the blame. Reporters may only have an hour or two to put together a story; and so, they may rely on press releases. And, it<U+2019>s not hard to imagine how drug company press releases might be biased. But, surely, press releases from the scientists themselves, and their institutions, would present the facts fairly, and without spin, right? Researchers decided to put it to the test. \nCritics blame the media. But, where do you think they<U+2019>re getting the information from? One might assume that press releases from prestigious academic medical centers would be measured, unexaggerated<U+2014>but suffer from the same problems: downplaying side-effects, conflicts of interest, study limitations, and promoting research that has uncertain relevance to human health. \nFor example, most laboratory or animal studies explicitly claimed relevance to human health<U+2014>yet lacked caveats about extrapolating results to people. For example, a release about a study of ultrasound reducing tumors in mice, was titled <U+201C>Researchers study the use of ultrasound for treatment of cancer<U+201D><U+2014>failing to note <U+201C>for your pet mouse.<U+201D> \nApparently, it<U+2019>s been estimated that less than ten percent of animal research ever succeeds in being translated to human clinical use. Overselling the results of lab animal studies as a promised cure potentially confuses readers, and might contribute to disillusionment with science. \nAlthough it<U+2019>s common to blame the media for exaggerations, most times they don<U+2019>t just make it up. That<U+2019>s what the research institutions are sending out in their own press releases. And, medical journals, too. Sometimes, medical journal press releases do more harm than good. An analysis of press releases from some of the most prestigious medical journals found the same litany of problems. \nI don<U+2019>t think most people realize that journals sell what are called reprints, copies of the articles they print, to drug companies, which can bring in big bucks. Like, drug companies may buy a million copies of a favorable article. Sometimes, the company will submit an article, and promise to buy a certain number in advance<U+2014>which is effectively a bribe, notes a long-time editor-in-chief at the prestigious British Medical Journal . He remembers once when a woman from a public relations company rang him up, and stopped just short of saying she would go to bed with him if they published the paper. \nAnother medical journal conflict of interest relates to advertising<U+2014>a major source of income for many journals. Most of the advertising comes from pharmaceutical companies. And, so, if they don<U+2019>t like a study, they can threaten to withdraw their advertising<U+2014>potentially leaving editors faced with the stark choice of agreeing to bury a particular piece, or seeing their journal die. \nEven if journalists have time to skip the press releases, and go straight to the source, and try to read the studies themselves, they may find them utterly incomprehensible gobbledygook. But, even if they do understand them, scientific articles are not simply reports of facts. Authors often have many opportunities to add <U+201C>spin<U+201D> to their scientific reports<U+2014>defined as ways that can distort the interpretation of results, and mislead readers, either unconsciously, or with willful intent to deceive. \nWhat these researchers did was look at randomized controlled trials with statistically nonsignificant results<U+2014>meaning some drug, for example, was compared to a sugar pill, and the difference between the newfangled treatment and placebo was essentially nonexistent. Would the researchers just lay out the truth, and be, like, well, we spent all this time and money, and in terms of our primary outcome, we got nothing. Or, would they try to spin it? In 68% of cases, they spun. There was spin in the abstract, which is like the summary of the article. And this is particularly alarming, because the abstract is often the only part of an article people actually read. \nAnd so, no wonder the media often gets it wrong. Spin in the abstracts can turn into spin in the press releases, and results in spin in the news. Therefore, even if journalists are doing their due diligence, using the original abstract conclusion in good faith, they still run the risk of deceiving their readers. \nResearchers presenting new findings could always be careful to stress how preliminary the findings may be. But, let<U+2019>s be serious, powerful self-interests may prevail. \nFinally, though, I think the biggest problem with the way media reports on medicine is the choice as to which stories are covered. In 2003, SARS and bioterrorism killed less than a dozen people, yet generated over a hundred thousand media reports<U+2014>far more than those covering the actual greatest threats to our lives and health. \nIn fact, ironically, the more people that die, the less it appears something is covered. Our leading #1 killer is heart disease. Yet, it can be prevented, treated, and even reversed with diet and lifestyle changes. Now that is something that deserves to be on the front page. \n  Close Sources Video Sources",

It's like nothing we've seen on any other planet in the entire Universe, and now the mysterious structure on Saturn's north pole just got even weirder. In just four years, Saturn's hexagon has changed its colour from blue to gold. So far, our best guess as to why this change occurred is that this is what it looks like when Saturn's north pole gears up for next year's summer solstice. Discovered almost 30 years ago, Saturn's hexagon is a six-sided structure that spans roughly 32,000 km (20,000 miles) in diameter, and extends about 100 km (60 miles) down into the planet's dense atmosphere. As observed by NASA's Voyager and Cassini spacecraft, each point of the hexagon appears to rotate at its centre at nearly the same rate that Saturn rotates on its axis. Along the rim of the hexagon, a jet stream of air is blasting eastward at speeds of 321 km/h (200 mph). <U+00A9> NASA Based on its size and movements, scientists have concluded that it's a vast cloud pattern generated by a gigantic, perpetual hurricane spinning at the centre of the planet's north pole. Scientists estimate that this storm has been raging for decades - maybe even centuries . While we're pretty confident that we know what Saturn's hexagon is, the big mystery is how it got there in the first place. Once you have a giant whirlpool of air, it's relatively easy to keep it spinning - but the force you need to get it wound up in the first place is a whole lot more difficult to explain. \"Scientists have bandied about a number of explanations for the hexagon's origin,\" says Charles Q. Choi from Space.com. \"For instance, water swirling inside a bucket can generate whirlpools possessing holes with geometric shapes. However, there is of course no giant bucket on Saturn holding this gargantuan hexagon.\" Now we've got something else to explain - how the Cassini spacecraft could have observed two completely different colours in the hexagon between November 2012 and September 2016. Here's more of the false colour hexagon: The best hypothesis we have right now is that this is what it looks like when Saturn changes seasons. With a year that lasts 29 Earth years, Saturn changes seasons only once every seven years, and the increased sunlight over the past three years could explain the golden haze. As NASA explains: \"The colour change is thought to be an effect of Saturn's seasons. In particular, the change from a bluish colour to a more golden hue may be due to the increased production of photochemical hazes in the atmosphere as the north pole approaches summer solstice in May 2017.\" So how does this work? It's thought that the hexagon acts sort of like a barrier, preventing haze - or aerosol - particles produced on the outside from getting in. This is evidenced by the fact that when scientists analysed the hexagon in false colour (as seen in the video), they noticed differences in the types of particles that were being suspended in the atmosphere - both inside and outside the hexagon. \"Inside the hexagon, there are fewer large haze particles and a concentration of small haze particles, while outside the hexagon, the opposite is true,\" Kunio Sayanagi, a Cassini imaging team associate at Hampton University, explained back in 2013. \"The hexagonal jet stream is acting like a barrier, which results in something like Earth's Antarctic ozone hole.\" During the polar winter between November 1995 and August 2009, Saturn's north polar atmosphere became clear of aerosols produced by photochemical reactions - reactions caused by sunlight interacting with the atmosphere - and we got to see its hexagon in clear blue: <U+00A9> NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute/Val Klavans True color photo taken 26 June 2013 But since Saturn reached its equinox in August 2009 - the point where the Sun is directly over Saturn's equator - it's been gradually exposed to more and more sunlight. This means for the past three years, aerosols have been produced inside of the hexagon and around the north pole, making the polar atmosphere appear hazy and golden when photographed last month. Without more evidence though, this is just an educated guess , and scientists at NASA now have an investigation underway to figure out what's actually going on here. \"Other effects, including changes in atmospheric circulation, could also be playing a role,\" NASA explained this week . \"Scientists think seasonally shifting patterns of solar heating probably influence the winds in the polar regions.\" Cassini is continuing its orbits around Saturn, and its moons, Titan, Mimas, Daphnis, Methone, and Pandora, in the coming months , so get ready to see more strange images of their seasonal shifts.",

The People<U+2019>s Assembly was a parallel event, where farmers, consumer movements, and their associated networks discussed how we can feed the world in a safe way. Both events are now over, so what happens now? Read the article below to find out.\nREAD: Monsanto <U+201C>Crimes Against Humanity<U+201D> Tribunal Officially Begins October 14th In Hague Netherlands \nThe hearings of the Monsanto Tribunal were very impressive, and so was the People<U+2019>s Assembly. During the last two days of the event, the world watched witnesses<U+2019> testimonies, lawyers<U+2019> pleas, and the first impressions of the judges. At the Tribunal, 750 people participated in The Hague representing 30 nationalities from all over the world, thousands of people followed online on the livestream and social media, and the Tribunal received a lot of press attention.\nBoth victims and experts thanked us for giving them a voice on this important international platform <U+2014> and a very well documented voice in this new process to hold corporations accountable for their acts.\nThe chairwoman of the Tribunal, Judge Tulkens, expressed the importance of the Tribunal in an interview with the French newspaper, Le Monde:\nThe questions of the access to water and to healthy food are old. Those are not new issues coming out of the mind of angry activists. Those issues, just like the right to a healthy environment are likely to become more important with climate change. It is our duty to set legal tools to face those issues. The Monsanto Tribunal is a step and a tool within this dynamic.<U+201D> \nThe Tribunal received quite a lot of media coverage. From French and German TV news programs to many newspapers and radio programs in various countries. See the links on our social media platforms (and later on the website).\nDid Monsanto attend the Tribunal? Monsanto was invited to the Tribunal, but decided not to appear for their defense. We did get their attention though. They issued a statement in 5 languages saying that we are <U+2018>pushing<U+2019> the wrong issues, since the real discussion is about feeding the world. Monsanto fails to see feeding the world in a safe way was exactly the topic of the Tribunal and of the discussion farmers, consumer movements, and their associated networks had in the parallel People<U+2019>s Assembly.\nMany eminent speakers stressed that Monsanto and agribusiness giants like them do not feed the world. Rather, they are involved in producing commodities, feed for animals, fuel for cars, and sugar for the food industry at a very high cost for human health and environment. This is production that feeds profit, not people. It<U+2019>s the small- and medium-scale farmers that are actually feeding the world.\nWhat is the purpose of the Monsanto Tribunal and the People<U+2019>s Assembly? This Tribunal and People<U+2019>s Assembly are about showing the tremendous costs of industrial farming for humans, for health, and for nature . They are also about standing up to Monsanto and their likes, and stopping them from poisoning our world and controlling our food supply. One way to do this is by showing the true cost of the current global food system, and the very real alternatives that exist.\nNnimmo Bassey at the opening said :\nBeing an ambassador to this Tribunal is like being an ambassador to mother Earth. If mother Earth could speak, Monsanto ought to be in jail long before now. Food is a celebration, it is culture, it is life. This is a struggle not against one multinational corporation, it is a struggle for life, it is a struggle for liberty. A struggle to stop big companies from colonizing our food systems, colonizing our agriculture, holding mother Earth as a slave for their profits.<U+201D> \nIf you want, you can follow the Monsanto Tribunal on Facebook , where many pictures and videos have already been posted. You can also see them if you have no Facebook yourself. In the coming weeks, we will continue to release short interviews of the witnesses, experts and lawyers, as well as the speakers in the People<U+2019>s Assembly. We will also add all of this to our website , including all the hearings of the Tribunal and the written testimonies in different languages. Please be patient, we will keep you informed!\nWhat happens now that the Tribunal is over? The judges are now thoroughly reviewing the evidence from legal briefs and witness testimonies to answer the six questions posed in the Tribunal<U+2019>s terms of reference. They will then present a legal advisory opinion, hopefully soon but if necessary next spring: we will supply logistic support, but the timing is up to them.\nAs Judge Tulkens said:\nWe will try to deliver the legal opinion before December 10th, the International Day of human Rights. It will be addressed to Monsanto and to the United Nations. From this legal opinion, other jurisdictions can be involved and more judges will step in. We, as the judges [at the Monsanto Tribunal]have seen, heard, noted and deliberated. Chances are that the international law will take into consideration new issues such as the ones related to ecocide.<U+201D> \nWhat you can do to help We would like to thank you and all the volunteers for your amazing support. This would not have been possible without you. Stay tuned, follow us on social media, show your support and share messages wherever and whenever you can. Ask friends to sign their support . Together we will put an end to the era of poisoning and exploiting the world and move onward to a system where we work with nature instead of waging a war against it.\nNote: Image from the Monsanto Tribunal. \nOriginally published on the Monsanto Tribunal website . \nVia: Food Revolution\nh/t Stillness in the Storm \n",

Lee \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-election-deals-sharp-blow-to-obamas-legacy-1478708165 \n text: The election of Donald Trump to the White House delivers a blow to the legacy of President Barack Obama on a multitude of domestic and foreign policies. It is also a defeat for a leader who campaigned relentlessly for Democrat Hillary Clinton and vilified the Republican nominee as unfit to serve as commander-in-chief. Mr. Trump waged a campaign that was a referendum on the entirety of Mr. Obama <U+2019>s record<U+2014>from the economy, immigration and climate change to the 2010 health-care law and the multinational agreement with Iran to restrain its nuclear program. Mr. Obama campaigned more visibly for his former secretary of state than any modern sitting president has for his party<U+2019>s nominee. First lady Michelle Obama campaigned equally as hard for Mrs. Clinton, delivering emotional pleas for voters to reject Mr. Trump. Both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton<U+2014>rivals eight years ago for the Democratic nomination<U+2014>recognized early that their goals would be reached or would fail together. Mr. Obama even sought to deter his own vice president, Joe Biden, from challenging her for the nomination. The transition of power from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump will be unlike any in American history. The president has repeatedly said the now-president-elect couldn<U+2019>t be trusted with the codes to the nation<U+2019>s nuclear weapons. More broadly, Mr. Trump represented an about-face in the brand of leadership Mr. Obama has embraced as president. The New York businessman was a leading proponent of false accusations that Mr. Obama wasn<U+2019>t born in the U.S. , and he has painted him as leader who weakened America<U+2019>s power on the world stage. For instance Mr. Trump frequently compared Mr. Obama unfavorably to Russian President Vladimir Putin, even though Moscow is increasingly challenging U.S. interests. Mr. Trump plans to alter the administration<U+2019>s overall approach to foreign policy, the military and national-security issues. Under a Trump presidency, the international climate-change agreement Mr. Obama helped forge is at risk of losing U.S. government support, the restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba likely could plateau and traditional American alliances from Europe to the Middle East to Asia are in question. Mr. Trump also has said he would derail a new trade pact with Asia, the Trans-Pacific Partnership , which is the linchpin of Mr. Obama<U+2019>s Asia policy. Mrs. Clinton also opposed the pact. Domestically, Mr. Trump has proposed strict immigration policies that were opposite of the platform Mr. Obama advanced while in office. He has promised to repeal Mr. Obama<U+2019>s signature health law, the Affordable Care Act, and reverse the president<U+2019>s executive actions aimed at combating climate change. Efforts to legislatively revamp the U.S. immigration system would face little chance of revival. <U+201C>Republicans are going to continue to try and legislatively chip away at his record of accomplishments,<U+201D> said Jim Manley, a former top adviser to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) who contributes opinion pieces to The Wall Street Journal. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said last week that Mr. Obama was leaving his schedule open this week for a possible meeting with his successor <U+201C>if it works for both people.<U+201D> The president is expected to issue a written statement on the election results, followed by public remarks<U+00A0>on Wednesday. Officials didn<U+2019>t respond to questions about the election results. Capital Journal is WSJ.com<U+2019>s home for Election 2016 news. Aides to Mr. Obama have said wouldn<U+2019>t feel settled about leaving office if Mrs. Clinton weren<U+2019>t elected. One of Mr. Obama<U+2019>s fears was that his successor would enter the White House and do what he did when he arrived in January 2009: spend the initial days undoing his predecessor<U+2019>s executive actions. Mr. Trump is likely to do just that. In the first two years of his presidency, when Democrats controlled the House and Senate, Mr. Obama netted his leading domestic policy achievement with the Affordable Care Act. He also won legislation changing financial regulations and a nearly $1 trillion economic stimulus package. But his climate change and immigration ambitions stalled; they never again gained traction in Congress. And for the remainder of his term, in the face of Republican opposition on Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama leaned on executive authority to implement a range of policy changes. <U+201C>I would consider it a personal insult<U+2014>an insult to my legacy<U+2014>if this community lets down its guard,<U+201D> Mr. Obama told black voters in the closing weeks of the campaign.

It is too early to know how regulators will treat the AT&T-Time Warner deal . But after several quiet years, President Barack Obama <U+2019>s antitrust team has switched into high gear in response to a recent spurt of deal-making. This trend is likely to continue in the next administration, as both presidential campaigns have signaled unease with the AT&T deal and with economic consolidation more broadly. Justice Department antitrust enforcers say they have sunk eight would-be deals over the past year and are currently waging court fights over three more, including two big health-insurance mergers. In all, the Justice Department has stopped 43 deals over the past eight years, more than double the mergers blocked by the preceding Bush Justice Department. The Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust duties with Justice, recently waged multiple challenges against hospital mergers and is considering whether to allow a combination of two of the country<U+2019>s largest drugstore chains, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Rite Aid Corp. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) on Monday called for a <U+201C>robust review<U+201D> of the AT&T deal. Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the committee, said the panel should hold a hearing on the deal <U+201C>without delay.<U+201D> Given the current merger fever, the antitrust views of the next president<U+2019>s nominees for attorney general, FTC head and Justice Department antitrust chief are likely to get a lot of attention. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has sent signals during the campaign that her administration would be active in antitrust enforcement. Republican Donald Trump has said he would not only fight the AT&T deal , but would also try to unwind a major media merger previously approved by the Obama team: Comcast Corp. <U+2019>s 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal. The Obama administration came into office promising a new day for antitrust after what it portrayed as a somnolent Bush era, but for the first few years its record was hard to distinguish from that of its predecessors, in part because of a soft deal market. That changed sharply last year, and it has continued in 2016 as many head-turning mergers have been announced. That is especially true in agriculture, where a trio of large deals, including Bayer AG <U+2019>s deal for Monsanto Co. and the proposed merger of Dow Chemical Co. and DuPont Co. , have prompted concerns in farm states. Republicans are often skeptical of government intervention, but several GOP leaders have raised concerns about industry concentration, while others have notably refrained from criticizing the Obama administration. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m afraid that this consolidation wave may have become a tsunami,<U+201D> Sen. Grassley told agriculture executives at a congressional hearing last month. Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), chairman of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, has expressed concern about several mergers, including the agriculture deals, the AT&T transaction and brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev NV<U+2019>s takeover of SABMiller PLC. <U+201C>The Republican Party is shifting from the party of big business to the party of populism, and that<U+2019>s a big deal for antitrust,<U+201D> said University of Iowa law professor Herbert Hovenkamp. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s an inherent suspicion of things that are big, and it<U+2019>s not limited to big government.<U+201D> Democratic leaders, for their part, are facing pressure from fiery figures like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.). <U+201C>Today in America, competition is dying,<U+201D> Ms. Warren said in a major antitrust speech this summer. <U+201C>Mergers are outrunning enforcement.<U+201D> As the economy picks up steam, many companies have made bold moves to get bigger fast, and that has lit a fire under competition regulators. But a recent wave of deals shows assertive antitrust enforcement hasn<U+2019>t deterred companies from testing the waters. More than five multibillion-dollar deals were announced this past week, totaling $207 billion in deal volume globally <U+2014>and making it the biggest week since 1999, according to data provider Dealogic. Beyond the AT&T-Time Warner deal, the data include British American Tobacco PLC<U+2019>s proposed deal to buy the rest of Reynolds American . <U+201C>The message doesn<U+2019>t seem to have sunk in,<U+201D> said William Kovacic, a former Republican chairman of the FTC and now a law professor at George Washington University. <U+201C>People keep trying to climb that mountain to higher and higher reaches of concentration.<U+201D> Companies that attract a government antitrust lawsuit face months of uncertainty for their businesses and employees, and often costly deal termination fees if they lose. Among the failures in recent months was Halliburton Co. <U+2019>s attempt to buy oil-field-services rival Baker Hughes Inc. The Justice Department sued in April, and officials said the deal was so problematic it never should have left the boardroom.<U+00A0>The companies abandoned their plans a month later, and Halliburton paid a $3.5 billion breakup fee to Baker Hughes. It is unclear whether a similar fate awaits other mergers<U+2014>not just the AT&T deal but Aetna Inc. <U+2019>s would-be combination with Humana Inc. and Anthem Inc. <U+2019>s proposed acquisition of Cigna Corp. Those two mergers would turn the top five national health insurers into three giant companies, and the Justice Department sued in July to block them. Court rulings on both deals are expected in early 2017. <U+201C>I was at the agency for 17 years, and I cannot think of another period where there was this much litigation occurring,<U+201D> said William Stallings, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer now with Mayer Brown LLP. Enforcers are also voicing more skepticism of <U+201C>fixes<U+201D> that companies may propose to convince the government that competition will continue after a merger, for example committing to sell some of their assets to a third party. In structuring its deal for Time Warner, AT&T showed it has to some extent learned from its 2011 bid to buy T-Mobile US Inc., which was blocked by Washington<U+2014>forcing it to pay billions in breakup fees. This time around, AT&T agreed to a much smaller fee of just $500 million if the Time Warner deal suffers a similar fate. Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com",

Ill-positioned for the startling outcome, investors now have to sort out a tectonic shift in American politics flat-footed. The first reaction will be a heavy dose of mayhem as markets digest the shock. U.S. stocks seem poised to drop sharply Wednesday, with stock futures falling sharply in Tuesday night trading. The dollar fell in Asian trading, with the Japanese yen and the euro rallying more than 2% as results came in for Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s performance sends a glaring signal. Half the U.S. electorate has rejected the status quo of policy making and global economic order. The global consensus toward more unfettered trade is surely behind us, as foreshadowed by the U.K.<U+2019>s vote to exit the European Union. A trade war with China and Mexico may not materialize, but a more insular looking America would surely hurt companies that sell abroad, such as Boeing and Intel, and those that produce abroad but sell in the U.S., such as Apple. Domestic companies, such as media and telecom stocks like Verizon and Comcast, would appear more insulated. Companies like pharmaceuticals, seen as exposed to a Hillary Clinton presidency, could be buoyed by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s win. A Trump win raises massive questions on how the world<U+2019>s largest economy will be managed. An expected rate increase next month comes into question if the Federal Reserve is unnerved by the market<U+2019>s reaction. Meanwhile, the longer-term management of the Fed is up in the air should Mr. Trump win. Janet Yellen <U+2019>s term expires in January 2018, and Mr. Trump has promised to replace her. Some will dismiss the Trump win as a Brexit redux and the market reaction as a short-term blip. That take dismisses the real effects Brexit still holds for the U.K. economy as it is worked out. But more importantly, the U.K. economy is just 3.5% of the world<U+2019>s. The U.S. is a quarter of the world<U+2019>s. Its currency underpins the global monetary system. A Clinton win would have likely represented continuity for investors: a left-leaning Democrat facing at least a partially Republican Congress. But Mr. Trump isn<U+2019>t just another Republican president with a predictable pro-business collection of policies. He supports maintaining entitlements and dismantling the free-trade consensus that has ruled U.S. economic policy for a generation. His relationship with a Republican-controlled Congress, many of whose members opposed him, will determine how much of his agenda, from building a wall with Mexico to slashing tax rates, is passed. His way of thinking will be a powerful force in the Republican Party and in politics generally. The election is ending, but the uncertainty for investors may have only begun.

The so-called <U+201C>Arab spring<U+201D> has brought many changes in its wake. However, war being one of the most important outcomes of this <U+201C>spring<U+201D>, certain changes in the erstwhile foreign policy orientation of many countries, big and small alike, was expected. To this particular outcome owes the growth of China-Israel relations that continue to develop stronger and deeper every year. Facts speak for themselves: China<U+2019>s total capital investment in Israeli high-tech deals involving Chinese businesses is expected to reach around $500 million by the end of 2016, compared to $467 million in 2014 and $118 million in 2012. And as Times of Israel reported recently, Chinese acquisitions in Israel have dramatically increased in the last few years. In March 2015, China<U+2019>s Bright Food acquired Tnuva , one of Israel<U+2019>s largest dairy companies for approximately $2.1 billion. Similarly, in July 2016, a Chinese consortium that included private equity firm Yunfeng Capital <U+2014> founded by Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma <U+2013> acquired Israeli social games company Playtika from Caesars Interactive Entertainment online games unit for $4.4 billion in cash. In August 2016, ChemChina completed its takeover of Adama <U+2014> considered one of the world<U+2019>s leading crop protection companies <U+2014> for approximately $1.4 billion. The high level of growth is<U+2014>and it is not a coincidence<U+2014>running parallel to the intensification and geographical spread of the conflict in the Mid-East region, particularly in and around the Suez canal region. While Syria and Iraq are direct victims of terrorism, many important countries such as Egypt (read: Egypt<U+2019>s Sisi is building ties with Syria because of the fears of being the next target of jihadist militias) are only inches away from breaking down into shatters, pushing China to find an alternative route and construct an alternative geography of trade to steer its own business in the region. Israel, as such, happens to be the best country in the region. Not only is it politically and militarily stable, but its geographical location also makes it an apt candidate to qualify for partnership in China<U+2019>s <U+2018>Silk Road<U+2019> on its southern corridor, which is China<U+2019>s route to Europe. Before the emergence of <U+2018>jihadi<U+2019> groups in the Middle East, China depended on the Suez Canal to reach its largest export destination: Europe. With its trade volume standing roughly at <U+20AC>521 billion in 2015, and the volume of their bi-lateral trade crossing well over <U+20AC>1 billion a day , Europe undoubtedly remains one of the most important markets for the Chinese business, and with it remains the Mid-East the only geographical entity to facilitate this trade. However, the presence of ISIS, Al Qaeda and other Islamic extremist groups in the Sinai are threatening China<U+2019>s maritime trade. With over 95% of global trade being seaborne and China now as the world<U+2019>s largest trading state, this is a serious challenge for Beijing<U+2019>s continued economic development. The crisis in the Middle East is, therefore, directly threatening China<U+2019>s economic interest. And, while China has already stepped in the crisis (read: China<U+2019>s Rear Adm Guan Youfei recently visited Syria to boost co-operation with the Syrian army), this is not the only way it is following to protect its vital interests. This is where Israel becomes important for China. The growing economic alliance between Israel and China is moving forward with a $2 billion, 300 kilometre freight rail link connecting Eilat, on the Red Sea, with Ashdod Port, on the Mediterranean. The project, nicknamed the <U+2018>Red-Med,<U+2019> was greenlit by Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu<U+2019>s cabinet, and construction, which is expected to take five years, will begin within the year. About the link, Netanyahu said, <U+201C>It<U+2019>s the first time we<U+2019>d be able to assist the countries in Europe and Asia to make sure they always have an open connection between Europe and Asia and between Asia and Europe.<U+201D> While Israel is clearly poised to play a pivotal role in providing an unhindered and a secure trade route for European and Asia countries, China<U+2019>s primary motivation is not to merely to build a network of allies in the Middle East. For China, the primary concern remains, apart from its trade with the Mid-Eastern countries, access to Europe and the African continent via the Middle East. However, both of these concerns cannot be effectively satisfied when the entire region remains under crisis. China, due to its fairly balanced approach to the crisis and the fact that it is perhaps the only global player that continues to enjoy equally good relations with such arch rivals as, for instance, Israel and Iran and Saudi Arabia and Iran, is an important country for the regional countries to look up to as a conflict mediator. This assumption about China playing this role owes its existence to the geography of trade China is eyeing to build through the Mid-East. As an alternative to shipping through the crowded Suez Canal, China sees value in sending goods into the Persian Gulf, and shipping them overland to the Mediterranean via several lines that could cross through Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar or even southern Iraq before finally continuing through Jordan and Israel. Will China eventually built this geography or not is a moot question. However, it is quite obvious that regional countries are open to it and know the potential benefits it can yield. Speaking at to the inaugural SIGNAL conference on Israel<U+2019>s China policy at the IDC in Herzliya in the last week of September, Capt. Yigal Maor, director general of the Israel<U+2019>s Transportation Ministry<U+2019>s Administration of Shipping and Ports, said that If China invests in building those paths, which he dubbed IGEC <U+2013> the Israel Gulf Economic Corridor <U+2013> it could push Gulf countries into more formal ties with Israel. <U+201C>Maybe with the help of China there will be peace in that area,<U+201D> he said. Whereas such prospects signal Israel<U+2019>s own elevation from the position of a US <U+201C>protected<U+201D> state to an important power, integrating the region, as also continents, the potential entry of the <U+201C>dragon<U+201D> in the region, connecting various countries into a whole, is likely to yield important results for the whole region. While we may have to wait a little to see what impact it leaves exactly, it is quite obvious that China is poised to become an important player in the Mideast security scene, and is already asserting its role economically, diplomatically and, to some extent, militarily.

This Wisconsin town believes it may have the answer. \n\nIn recent years, bullying-related suicides account for over 6,000 deaths per year for people ages 15 through 24. This Wisconsin town passed a law that forces parents to pay a fine if their child is a bully. \n\nAs the connection between bullying and suicide becomes undeniable, parents, teachers, and students alike are trying to find a solution to this very important issue. Yet, there are too many adults who still see bullying as just another aspect of growing up. It has been proven that bullying is a prevalent problem that leads to many negative effects for it<U+2019>s victims. Some of these negative effects include depression, fear, lack of motivation to attend school, and suicide. \n\nPolice in Shawano, Wisconsin are trying to curb bullying by holding parents accountable if their child is involved in bullying. \n\nThe city council of Shawano just passed an ordinance that allows police to intervene when aggression happens. The law applies to anyone under the age of 18 and covers various forms of harassment ranging from taking lunch money to cyberbullying on social media. \n\nShawano parents will be warned after the first incident, but if the child<U+2019>s behavior doesn<U+2019>t change within 90 days, parents will be fined $366. A repeat offender will be fined $681. \n\nWhile the majority of parents agree that bullying needs to stop, the new ordinance has raised a lot of controversy. Some critics believe that there could be difficulty distinguishing between playful banter and harassment. But police Chief Mark Kohl assures the public that the ordinance is not generated towards <U+2018>kids being kids<U+2019> and playground banter, but instead towards kids who are meticulously using social media or their words to purposefully hurt others. \n\nWhile some parents embrace the fining idea, others disagree believing it will not solve the issue, only burning a hole in the pockets of already stressed out parents. \n\nIt is an interesting solution and only time will tell if it works. Feel free to share you own thoughts on the subject. \n\nShare this to start a dialogue about the issue of bullying in your community. \n\nAriana Marisol is a contributing staff writer for REALfarmacy.com.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Bob Adelmann \n source: thenewamerican.com \n text: Email \nPoll results released on Wednesday by Gallup confirm the trend toward the acceptance of the freedom to own guns and support of the Second Amendment. Sixteen years ago 59 percent of those polled favored <U+201C>a law which would make it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess semi-automatic guns known as assault rifles,<U+201D> while just 39 percent were opposed. Today those numbers have flipped: Just 36 percent support a ban, while 61 percent of those polled oppose it. \nEven those polled who don<U+2019>t have a gun in their home oppose such a ban. Most surprisingly, however, is that support for such a ban has dropped even among those most likely to support one: Democrats. In the year 2000, 63 percent of Democrats supported such a ban, while today just 50 percent do. Wrote Art Swift for Gallup: <U+201C>It is striking <U+2014> and unusual <U+2014> that fewer Democrats than ever support an assault weapons ban, since the Democratic Party has been instrumental in pushing for stricter gun laws.<U+201D> \nPerhaps comforting to those watching how Independents might vote in the upcoming presidential election, Gallup reported that just 31 percent of them support such a ban (the same as Democrats), while in 2000, 63 percent did. \nSwift called the results a <U+201C>paradox<U+201D>: Perhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. These guns were used in high-profile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. \nGallup could help its cause by defining more carefully the distinct difference between <U+201C>assault rifles<U+201D> and <U+201C>assault weapons.<U+201D> Assault rifles have been heavily regulated for decades, being defined as rifles used by the military that are <U+201C>select<U+201D> fire: able to fire multiple rounds with a single press of the finger on the trigger. <U+201C>Assault weapons<U+201D> were never defined until the Brady Bill was passed into law in 1994. Then they were defined as rifles that were <U+201C>semi-automatic,<U+201D> firing but a single round with a single press of the trigger. The bill also declared such a weapon as banned if it had any two of five cosmetic features that had nothing to do with its lethality: a collapsible stock, a pistol grip, a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor, or a grenade launcher (which is useless without grenades). \nCommentators jumped on the Gallup report with all manner of explanations as to the cause of the continuing drop in support for a ban or, conversely, citizens<U+2019> increasing support for gun ownership. Sean Davis, the co-founder of The Federalist , declared, <U+201C>Americans understand that terrorists want to murder us, and that our laws are no obstacle to their blood lust. They will use planes, or bombs, or trucks, or knives, or box cutters, or guns.<U+2026> Strict gun control laws in cities like Chicago and Washington, D.C. have done nothing to prevent sky-high murder rates in those cities year after year.<U+201D> \nIt<U+2019>s possible that the message offered for years by Pastor Chuck Baldwin, a presidential candidate for the Constitution Party in 2008, is gaining purchase as well. In a recent newsletter Baldwin pulled no punches: To take away the citizen<U+2019>s right to bear a semi-automatic rifle is to, in effect, completely disarm him<U+2026>. The only reason that would-be tyrants in the US government have been kept at bay is because of an American citizenry fully armed with semi-automatic rifles. \nThat they are <U+201C>fully armed<U+201D> may be an understatement. The usual estimate of the number of firearms owned by American citizens has routinely been reported at 300 million, plus or minus. But that doesn<U+2019>t square with the fact of increasing numbers of citizens purchasing firearms, setting records month-after-month for the last year and a half. WeaponsMan blog, written by a former Special Forces soldier and a stickler for details, investigated the publicly available data from government sources, including the ATF itself, and found the number to be vastly larger: upwards of 660 million. His analysis is available here . \nHe concludes <U+201C>that the US inventory of firearms is almost certainly between 412 and 660 million, not the lower numbers recently trumpeted by the media.<U+201D> \nThe irony remains that, thanks to the media<U+2019>s propaganda blitz against the private ownership of firearms, awareness of what the true agenda is continues to grow. The harder gun-grabbers push, the harder it will be for them to accomplish their ultimate goal: complete confiscation of every firearm from every private citizen in the country. More than 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson saw the threat, and gave perhaps the most reasonable explanation for today<U+2019>s increasing support of the right of the people to buy, bear, keep and use firearms: The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government. \nAn Ivy League graduate and former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.

German Magazine Uses ISIS Propaganda Video to Show All is Well in Mosul \nWell they are on the same side, after all Originally appeared at Sputnik \nIn an almost four-minute video, political editor of Spiegel Online Christoph Sydow tried to defend the editorial policy of his magazine regarding the developments in Aleppo and Mosul. However, the shots demonstrated in his video turned out to be the propaganda materials of Daesh terrorists. \nThe video was supposed to be a response to critical letters of Spiegel Online readers and their comments on social networks. Many of them accused the magazine of spreading propaganda and presenting the situation in the Middle East in a biased manner. \"Again and again, readers have been accusing us of presenting the Aleppo siege as a bad one, and that of Mosul as a good one. That's not right. Political editor Christoph Sydow explains the similarities and the differences,\" Spiegel Online reported. In the video, Sydow explained the similarities and differences of both situations. \"Eastern Aleppo has been cut off from the outside world for months. There is no help coming to the city. People are starving. There is no drinking water, lack of electricity. In Mosul, the situation is different at the moment. The city can receive supplies; people have water, electricity, enough food. Nobody was starving to death there yet,\" Sydow said. To prove his point of view, the journalist referred to video footage showing that the situation in Mosul is not as bad as one probably imagined. But it turns out that the footage he used was Daesh propaganda material who currently keep Mosul under their control. 1046870142.png \nAccording to BILDblog, which sharply criticized the German magazine for the releasing video, the shots of the city were published by Daesh a few days ago to make a false impression that people in the city \"live a normal life,\" which in fact is not true. \n\"This is the most recent Daesh propaganda video which was published online five days ago. It is supposed to show normal life in Mosul, happy people, who have everything they need. However, in fact, there is a lack of water, food, medicines and electricity. This is what people from Mosul tell their relatives in secret telephone calls,\" the ARD report said. 1046870197.png \nIn the right upper corner of the video, near the logo of the Spiegel magazine, one can see \"an Amaq\" symbol <U+2014> the logo of Al-Amaq news agency, a media outlet considered an official part Daesh's propaganda apparatus. \"This is the propaganda material of the so-called 'Islamic State' (Daesh),\" BILDblog wrote. \nEarlier, Germany's ARD TV channel used the same recordings in its report called \"Iraq: Inside Mosul\". However, in contrast to Spiegel, the ARD stated that the information was taken from Daesh propaganda sources.",

The luxury retailer<U+2019>s flagship Fifth Avenue store is next door to Trump Tower, where the president-elect resides. Protests and high security following the election have made it a nightmare to get anywhere in that part of Manhattan. Though a resulting decline in store traffic could crimp Tiffany<U+2019>s holiday results, macroeconomic concerns could <U+201C>trump<U+201D> the physical disruption. But first up are its results, due Tuesday, for the fiscal third quarter ended in October. After having ratcheted their expectations lower in recent months, analysts now forecast that Tiffany earned 67 cents a share, down three cents from a year ago. This estimate was as high as 83 cents at the end of last year. Revenue is expected to have fallen 1.5% to $924 million. Tiffany shares have underperformed the S&P 500 by 6 percentage points this year. Some of that is due to Wall Street<U+2019>s relatively tough times; bonuses are expected to fall for a third consecutive year and be about 5% to 10% smaller than a year ago, according to a report published earlier this month by consulting firm Johnson Associates Inc. That presents another blow to the flagship Fifth Avenue store, which makes up about 10% of overall revenue. Additionally, roughly 40% of those sales come from foreign tourists. Tiffany has acknowledged that spending by overseas visitors, particularly from China, isn<U+2019>t as strong as it used to be. Manhattan shopping splurges are far more costly due to the rising dollar , which last week hit a fresh 13-year high against major rivals. Tiffany<U+2019>s same-store sales have declined for three consecutive quarters and four of the past six. Analysts expect they dropped again in the third quarter, falling 4.1% from a year earlier. Mr. Trump isn<U+2019>t helping matters. Analysts at Cowen & Co. estimate Tiffany<U+2019>s fourth-quarter earnings could fall by three cents a share if store traffic dropped by 50% in the two weeks following the election.<U+00A0>And each additional week of protests and traffic disruption could lop another three to five cents a share off the bottom line. Tiffany<U+2019>s jewelry isn<U+2019>t a bargain. Neither is its stock price. Fetching 20 times projected earnings over the next 12 months, Tiffany<U+2019>s multiple is higher than average and richer than rivals LVMH Mo<U+00EB>t Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE , Burberry Group PLC and Coach Inc.

        "input": "time: null \n author: ALEXANDER BURNS THOMAS KAPLAN \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-james-comey.html?_r=0 \n text: Hillary Clinton worked to campaign past the revived controversy around her email server on Sunday, casting herself as a resilient fighter as Donald J. Trump intensified his sweeping claims of corruption in the American justice system. The announcement by James B. Comey , the F.B.I. director, of a new review of emails that may be linked to Mrs. Clinton overshadowed the candidates<U+2019> usual messages over the weekend. The news threw Mrs. Clinton and the Trump campaign into an unexpected debate over both her emails and Mr. Comey<U+2019>s conduct, though only scant information has been made public about the substance of the F.B.I.<U+2019>s activities. Campaigning in Florida, Mrs. Clinton appeared to group Mr. Comey<U+2019>s surprise role in the presidential race with the flurry of partisan attacks that often mark the last days of political campaigns. Without mentioning Mr. Comey by name, Mrs. Clinton struck a defiant note; at a nightclub in Wilton Manors, she invoked her mother<U+2019>s admonition to <U+201C>never, ever quit.<U+201D> <U+201C>We won<U+2019>t be distracted, no matter what our opponents throw at us,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton said. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters, and we know how many people are counting on us.<U+201D> At a black church in Fort Lauderdale, Mrs. Clinton urged voters to turn out in force to vote in order to reject <U+201C>a negative, hateful, bigoted vision<U+201D> on the other side of the race. If Mrs. Clinton has aimed to stifle interest in her emails, Mr. Trump has seized on Mr. Comey<U+2019>s announcement with exuberant glee. At a rally on Sunday in Colorado, Mr. Trump called the disclosure a <U+201C>big bombshell<U+201D> and predicted it would lift him in the polls. Having spent months criticizing both Mr. Comey and the Department of Justice for deciding not to press charges against Mrs. Clinton for her use of a private email server, Mr. Trump redirected his attack on Sunday, going after Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Mr. Trump accused Ms. Lynch of corruption for failing to indict Mrs. Clinton, claiming without evidence that Ms. Lynch had likely interfered with an investigation in the hope of retaining her job in a Clinton administration. <U+201C>Effectively, you<U+2019>d call that a bribe, wouldn<U+2019>t you?<U+201D> Mr. Trump asked at a speech in Las Vegas. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s closest advisers stopped well short of his provocative claim. But on the Sunday news programs, allies of Mr. Trump, including his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, attempted to sow deeper doubts about Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s trustworthiness without explicitly attacking the justice system. Still, both sides <U+2014> having scant information about what, exactly, Mr. Comey<U+2019>s new review might entail <U+2014> offered more insinuations than arguments with Election Day just nine days away. The code word for Mr. Pence was <U+201C>troubled<U+201D> <U+2014> a term he used freely on television to raise the notion, if not quite an accusation, that prosecutors had gone easy on Mrs. Clinton. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m one of millions of Americans that were troubled by that <U+2014> why there<U+2019>s this double standard when it comes to the Clintons,<U+201D> Mr. Pence said on <U+201C>Meet the Press<U+201D> on NBC. <U+201C>I mean, no one is above the law.<U+201D> And for Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s allies, the word of the day was <U+201C>puzzled<U+201D> <U+2014> the descriptor top Clinton surrogates wielded repeatedly as they implied, without quite saying, that Mr. Comey had staged an unforgivable political intervention late in the presidential race. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s just extremely puzzling,<U+201D> said Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s running mate, on <U+201C>This Week<U+201D> on ABC. <U+201C>I just have no way of understanding these actions. They<U+2019>re completely unprecedented and that<U+2019>s why I think he owes the American public more information.<U+201D> The stakes of the clash, muddled as it is, are plainly higher for Democrats: Mrs. Clinton had led consistently in polls ahead of Mr. Comey<U+2019>s announcement, and appeared close to having a firm lock on the 270 Electoral College votes required for victory. Only a late plot twist, it seemed, might be capable of undoing her advantage. It is unclear whether Mr. Comey<U+2019>s actions could amount to such an unforeseen turn. Mr. Comey, who notified Congress on Friday that information from a separate case prompted the fresh review of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s emails, has not offered any additional comment on the matter. Government officials have described the F.B.I.<U+2019>s new information as emerging from an investigation into allegations that Anthony D. Weiner, a former congressman married to Huma Abedin, one of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s closest aides, exchanged sexually themed messages with a teenager. Clinton allies repeatedly accused Mr. Comey of breaching Justice Department protocols by commenting on a confidential inquiry so close to an election, and expressed bewilderment at his conduct. Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign manager, adopted the same phrasing, describing the campaign as <U+201C>so puzzled<U+201D> by Mr. Comey<U+2019>s actions. He lamented that Mr. Comey had opened the floodgates to wild speculation by offering such a nonspecific announcement. <U+201C>The issue here is, if he doesn<U+2019>t come out and get all the information on the table, he<U+2019>s going to let anyone <U+2014> any conspiracy theory <U+2014> take the day,<U+201D> Mr. Mook said on <U+201C>Meet the Press.<U+201D> But Mr. Mook said he did not expect the F.B.I. director<U+2019>s unusual action to cost Mrs. Clinton the election. On the contrary, Mr. Mook said Mrs. Clinton was faring well in early voting and could lock down one or more swing states, starting with Nevada, before Election Day. A smattering of new polling information released on Sunday painted a mixed picture of the race in its final days, with Mrs. Clinton consistently holding an advantage but of uncertain size. It is likely too soon to see any direct effect from Friday<U+2019>s events, casting additional uncertainty over the importance of the latest revelations. Still, an ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll showed Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s advantage nationally slipping to just one percentage point, in a dramatic narrowing over the past week. And a New York Times/Siena College poll showed Mr. Trump retaking the lead in Florida. But polling from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, conducted by Marist College, found Mrs. Clinton faring better in Florida, ahead of Mr. Trump there by one point, and leading him by six points in North Carolina. Mr. Trump is spending several of the few days left in the race campaigning well outside the traditional band of states that decide presidential elections. He was campaigning on Sunday in New Mexico and plans on Monday to be in Michigan <U+2014> two solidly blue states where polling has shown Mrs. Clinton with a clear lead.

And we<U+2019>re not talking about a little, innocent smooch on the cheek, although that would be pretty weird as well, but a kiss on the lips.

Only two of the company<U+2019>s female workers refused to kiss their boss on the mouth and chose to resign instead. According to Chinese media reports, over half the unnamed company<U+2019>s staff members are women. \nFacing increasing pressure from both the media and the general public, the boss explained that he picked up the idea for the daily morning kiss while visiting a company in the United States, and claimed that the disgusting daily ceremony helps <U+201C>foster good relationships among colleagues<U+201D>, allowing him and his female staff to get along <U+201C>like fish and water<U+201D>.

Speaking at separate events, Brazil<U+2019>s central bank president, Ilan Goldfajn, and Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles said that plugging a widening budget hole is key to restoring confidence, taming inflation and getting Latin America<U+2019>s largest economy out of its worst recession on record. <U+201D>Increasing inflation to finance public spending is no longer an option, <U+201C> Mr. Goldfajn told business leaders gathered in Rio de Janeiro. <U+201C>Laws of fiscal adjustments are necessary.<U+201D> Brazil<U+2019>s Congress is considering public-spending limits for at least the next 10 years. A final vote in the Senate is expected next month. Other potentially controversial measures, including changes to Brazil<U+2019>s generous retirement system, are expected for next year. The measure represents a U-turn for a government that is used to expanding its costs faster than inflation for more than a decade and is facing headwinds among voters. The administration of President Michel Temer, who took over in August after former President Dilma Rousseff was ousted for alleged budget crimes, is trying to appease austerity critics by arguing it is the only way to resume growth. <U+201C>Fixing public-accounts deterioration is a prerequisite for the economy to grow again,<U+201D> Mr. Meirelles told business leaders in Bras<U+00ED>lia. Brazil<U+2019>s economy is forecast to contract 3.4% this year, according to a central-bank survey of economists released earlier Monday. The central bank last month cut its benchmark Selic rate to 14% from 14.25%, the first rate cut in four years, as prices weakened and the two-year recession showed no signs of relief. Consumer prices rose at a 7.9% annual pace in October, well above the official 4.5% target. Analysts expect another rate cut on Nov. 30, but that prospect has been shaken by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election. Among other things, economists say that if the new U.S. administration pushes for economic stimulus, as promised during the campaign, that could lead to higher borrowing costs in the U.S., which could slow down the pace of monetary easing in Brazil. <U+201D>The result of the American election is another element of uncertainty,<U+201D> Mr. Goldfajn said. <U+2014>Priscilla Oliveira contributed in this article Write to Paulo Trevisani at paulo.trevisani@wsj.com",

The leaders stressed joint positions on Ukraine, the migration crisis, the Syrian civil war and the importance of multilateral institutions, such as NATO, and working together in the fight against terrorism, according to the statement from the White House. They called on the Syrian regime, Russia and Iran to stop attacks against the city of Aleppo . Ms Merkel, speaking after the meeting, said the leaders didn<U+2019>t talk about specific sanctions against Russia for its behavior in Syria. European leaders had warned that Russia could be exposed to new sanctions if it continued increasing bombings in Syria. The leaders did agree though that conditions weren<U+2019>t met right now to lift sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, Ms. Merkel and the White House said. <U+201C>We want to make progress in the Minsk process but so far, such progress is unfortunately rather invisible,<U+201D> Ms. Merkel said, referring to the cease-fire accord for Ukraine. European leaders are scrambling to assess the possible impact of Donald Trump<U+2019>s election as U.S. president and were hoping for guidance from Mr. Obama on his successor<U+2019>s intentions , observers said. During his campaign, Mr. Trump floated possible rapprochements with Russia and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that could conflict with Europe<U+2019>s current posture toward Moscow and its position in the Syrian conflict. European leaders are also concerned Mr. Trump will demand higher military spending from Europe in exchange for continued U.S. support within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. After the meeting of the six, Ms. Merkel met with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and her British counterpart, Theresa May, in separate bilateral meetings. The British premier said she would update the German chancellor on preparations for exiting the EU, noting that preparations were <U+201C>on track<U+201D> for the legal process to leave the EU to begin at the end of March . Ms. Merkel cautioned, however, that she won<U+2019>t discuss Brexit at great length with Mrs. May, repeating her promise not to engage in negotiations about the U.K.<U+2019>s exit before the official process had been launched. <U+201C>We shall wait until that motion has been tabled,<U+201D> Ms. Merkel said, noting that the leaders would discuss a range of other EU-related issues, from migration to NATO. Since the Brexit referendum in June , London has hoped Germany would help it secure a future arrangement with the European Union that would maintain Britain<U+2019>s access to the EU<U+2019>s single market while drastically limiting European immigration to the U.K. Senior German officials initially sounded optimistic a deal could be struck, but their stance hardened after Ms. May signaled she wouldn<U+2019>t compromise on the issue of immigration . German and other European leaders insist the free movement of EU citizens is inseparable from membership in the single market. Friday<U+2019>s meeting caps Mr. Obama<U+2019>s last visit to Europe while in office. From Berlin, Mr. Obama will travel to Peru on Friday to attend a summit of Asian-Pacific leaders. Russian President Vladimir Putin is also scheduled to attend the meeting of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC. The White House isn<U+2019>t planning a meeting with Mr. Putin, either formal or informal. Instead, Mr. Obama will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Mr. Obama is expected to be peppered with questions about the election of Donald Trump as his successor, as he was while traveling in Greece and Germany. He<U+2019>ll also have to explain his inability to convince Congress to pass a new trade pact with Asia. White House officials conceded last week that Mr. Obama wouldn<U+2019>t achieve the Trans-Pacific Partnership before leaving office in January. Write to Carol E.

Through the first four weeks of the season, NFL viewership has declined 11%, and among the crucial adults 18-49 demographic that advertisers covet, ratings are down 12%. <U+201C>While our partners, like us, would have liked to see higher ratings, they remain confident in the NFL and unconcerned about a long-term issue,<U+201D> the letter from NFL senior executives Brian Rolapp and Howard Katz said, adding that over the last 15 years, ratings viewership has grown 27% and that football <U+201C>continues to be far and away the most powerful programming on television and the best place for brands and advertisers.<U+201D> The league said the large drop in ratings for prime-time games on ESPN, CBS and NBC is likely because of <U+201C>unprecedented interest in the Presidential election.<U+201D><U+00A0>On Sunday<U+00A0>afternoons, the audience for Fox News, CNN and MSNBC has increased as well, and the league believes that is cutting into those games. The letter also cited the 2000 election as another time when NFL ratings took a hit due to coverage of the race between George Bush and Al Gore and the subsequent legal battle over the results. As for a potential backlash by some viewers angered at players not standing for the national anthem to protest of police brutality, the NFL said it sees no evidence to that being a factor in declining ratings: <U+201C>In fact, our own data shows that the perception of the NFL and its players is actually up in 2016.<U+201D> The NFL said it was issuing the memo to all the teams in response to media inquiries about the decline in ratings. Long seen as invincible against the trends and changing media habits that have negatively affected other programming, network executives and advertisers have been scrambling to figure out if this is a short-term blip because of political news or the start of a long-term trend. Not everyone is convinced that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are solely to blame. Some industry analysts note that as the NFL continues to place product on more digital platforms , a negative hit to the broadcast partners is more likely. Others cite that the NFL may have hit saturation level with games on all day<U+00A0>Sunday,<U+00A0>as well as a<U+00A0>Monday<U+00A0>and<U+00A0>Thursday<U+00A0>game. In addition to the election coverage and some fans angered at the protests, another factor NFL media chief Brian Rolapp cited i n a Wall Street Journal interview was the absence of some marquee players due to injury and retirement, as another possible cause of the lower ratings.

Gold for December delivery settled down 0.6% at $1,216.90 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, its lowest close since June 2. The precious metal reversed gains after trading as high as $1,229.30 an ounce on Thursday morning. The WSJ Dollar Index was recently up 0.6% at 91.13, marking its ninth consecutive day of gains . A stronger dollar tends to hurt demand for gold, since the metal is priced in the U.S. currency and becomes more expensive to foreign investors when the greenback rises. On Thursday, Ms. Yellen said that a rate increase <U+201C>could well become appropriate relatively soon,<U+201D> in a prepared testimony. The market largely expects the central bank to raise rates at the next policy meeting in December.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Editor \n source: theeventchronicle.com \n text: Matter and antimatter, simultaneously. By BEC Crew\nAlmost 80 years ago, an Italian physicist proposed that a particle could exist as both matter and antimatter at the same time. Called the Majorana fermion, this mysterious state of matter set off a decades-long hunt, with scientists finding the first real evidence of its existence earlier this year .\nAnd now physicists in China have discovered that an elusive type of quasiparticle can behave just like a Majorana fermion, and it could help us to finally understand this incredibly weird phenomenon.\nIf you<U+2019>re not familiar with the Majorana fermion , it was first proposed by Italian theoretical physicist Ettore Majorana in 1937. He predicted that a type of particle called a fermion could act as its own antiparticle.\nIn the standard model of physics, every particle has an antiparticle. These antiparticles are usually an entirely separate particle, with the same mass but opposite charge of their partner.\nEven electrically neutral particles have antiparticles, such as the neutron, which is made of quarks, and the antineutron, which is made of antiquarks.\nIn very rare cases, a particle with no mass and no charge can act as its own antiparticle, and we<U+2019>ve only identified a few examples of these so far <U+2013> photons (light particles), hypothetical gravitons , and WIMPs .\nMajorana fermions, if they exist, fall into this final category, and if we can find them and harness them, it would change everything about how we record and process information in the next generation of quantum computers.\n<U+201C>The search for this particle is for condensed-matter physicists what the Higgs boson search was for high-energy particle physicists,<U+201D> physicist Leonid Rokhinson from Purdue University noted back in 2012 . <U+201C>It is a very peculiar object because it is a fermion yet it is its own antiparticle with zero mass and zero charge.<U+201D>\nUnlike regular computers that use bits of 0 and 1, quantum computers use quantum bits that can exist in a state of 0, 1, or a superposition of both.\nThe problem with building a computer out of quantum bits (or qubits) is that it<U+2019>s incredibly difficult to make a record of what state they previously held once they<U+2019>ve been switched, and there<U+2019>s no point having a computer that can<U+2019>t retain information.\nBut physicists think Majorana fermions could be the key to solving all of that.\n<U+201C>Information could be stored not in the individual particles, but in their relative configuration, so that if one particle is pushed a little by a local force, it doesn<U+2019>t matter,<U+201D> said Rokhinson .\n<U+201C>As long as that local noise is not so strong that it alters the overall configuration of a group of particles, the information is retained. It offers an entirely new way of dealing with information.<U+201D>\nIn April this year, a team from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee discovered the first real proof of the existence of Majorana fermions in something called a quasiparticle.\nUnlike a regular particle, which is a physical object that makes up an atom, a quasiparticle is an entity that has some characteristics of a distinct particle, but is made up of a grouping of multiple particles instead. Finding a Majorana fermion quasiparticle is one thing, but the real goal is finding a Majorana fermion particle.\nFast-forward to now, and physicists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences say they<U+2019>ve identified another type of quasiparticle that behaves just like a Majorana fermion, called Majorana zero modes (MZMs).\nThe team was able to synthesise these quasiparticles inside a quantum simulation, and manipulate them in ways that would work within a quantum computer system. Most significantly, they showed that they could retain information encoded in their Majorana zero modes, even when errors and <U+2018>noise<U+2019> were applied to the system.\n<U+201C>[W]e demonstrate the immunity of quantum information encoded in the Majorana zero modes against local errors through the simulator,<U+201D> they describe in their paper, published in Nature Communications. \nIf the team<U+2019>s simulation can be replicated in experimental conditions, it means we could have another candidate for Majorana fermion-like behaviours on our hands, and another shot at something to build the quantum computers of the future with.\nIn the meantime, here<U+2019>s more on those elusive Majorana fermions:\n\nSource: Science Alert \n",

Like her character, Metz has also struggled with her size ever since she was a little girl. \nIn an interview with People Magazine this week, Metz revealed that she has felt the exact same pains that 8-year-old Kate experienced in the flashbacks sequences shown on TV. \nFor Metz, even as a child her weight <U+201C>was always something I was cognizant of. I<U+2019>ve had pictures of when I was 3 and 4 years old, and I<U+2019>ve always been chubby.<U+201D> \nThen she discovered that her weight was something she was supposed to be ashamed of. Image Credit: David Livingston/Getty Images \nIn fact, she was enrolled in Weight Watchers at just 11 years old: \n<U+201C>I remember being at Weight Watchers at, like, 11 years old and my mom just trying to figure it out for me. \nIt<U+2019>s one of those things where it<U+2019>s heartbreaking because, as a parent, you want your child to have the best life possible and you want them to be protected and in this little bubble where everybody finds them to be beautiful and perfect and their lives to be amazing. \nBut that<U+2019>s not always the case.<U+201D> \nWhen she was young she would starve herself, but then as soon as she had the opportunity she would binge on unhealthy food. \nThe resulting weight gain perplexed her parents, because she hid her binges from them: \n<U+201C>I would not eat, and then, of course, I would get so hungry I would binge...and it was difficult because my parents were like, <U+2018>I don<U+2019>t understand, if you<U+2019>re not really eating, why are you gaining weight?<U+2019> I would be at one of my good friend<U+2019>s house and her mom would literally make us a tray of brownies and split it down the middle, and we would go to town.<U+201D> Image Credit: David Livingston/Getty Images \nAt 30, Metz realized that she doesn't have to stress and worry about what others think about her body. She called that a life-changing moment: \n<U+201C>I had this epiphany that my life is my own and my choices are my own.<U+201D> \nPrior to <U+201C>This Is Us,<U+201D> Metz appeared in only a few things , and certainly not as a lead actress. \nShe played Ima 'Barbara' Wiggles on <U+201C>American Horror Story: Freak Show,<U+201D> described as the <U+201C>fattest woman of all time<U+201D> by the show. \nEven then, she had to wear a fat suit on set: \nHer newfound fame and honest portrayal of a woman struggling with her weight has not gone to her head, though. She's staying grounded and grateful: \n<U+201C>I just feel really grateful that I can pursue my dreams and also reach people in ways that I never expected.<U+201D> \nMetz told Refinery 29 last month that women have already reached out to her and praised her touching portrayal of Kate. \nIn reality, 67% of American women are a size 14 or higher, but these women only make up about 2% of the images portrayed in the media, according to Refinery 29 . \nResearch has also shown that dieting is more likely to cause obesity than solve it, according to the New York Times : \n\"After about five years, 41 percent of dieters gain back more weight than they lost. Long-term studies show dieters are more likely than non-dieters to become obese over the next one to 15 years. \nThat<U+2019>s true in men and women, across ethnic groups, from childhood through middle age. The effect is strongest in those who started in the normal weight range, a group that includes almost half of the female dieters in the United States.\" \nWhile she's not the first, Metz's performance has the potential to open more doors for plus-sized actresses who are trying to find their place in Hollywood. Other actresses such as Rebel Wilson, Queen Latifah, and Melissa McCarthy have also helped pave the way.",

Now jittery markets await the invocation of Article 50, the treaty clause that will formally start exit negotiations. In the U.S. presidential election, legal betting can only take place outside the United States. At 2-5, the current odds are strongly in favor of a Hillary Clinton victory over Donald Trump, who is running at 2-1 odds. Financial-market indicators, such as the Swiss franc and Mexican peso exchange rates, as well as the price of gold, also suggest investors believe Mrs. Clinton will be the next U.S. president. The problem is that betting odds don<U+2019>t represent the probability of victory. Around 75% of the value of the bets placed on the U.K.<U+2019>s EU referendum, with an average bet of <U+00A3>450 ($550), were in favor of Remain. By contrast, the average bet in favor of Leave was <U+00A3>75. In fact, 62% of the volume of the bets placed were in favor of a British exit. But bookmakers manage financial risk, not democratic risk, and so the odds were skewed to reflect the value of bets. In Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s case, her 2-5 odds have been improved by a small number of large bets, according to the U.K. bookmaker Ladbrokes . Betting, in short, is plutocratic, while elections and referendums are more democratic. A person<U+2019>s income doesn<U+2019>t affect his right to vote, but it does affect his ability to bet. This democratic reality has been masked by the economic reality of the past two decades. Twenty years of global economic expansion has produced a group that has been <U+201C>left behind.<U+201D> This group is lower skilled, older and more rural. Its members have a lower income and generally face above-average inflation. In 2014 France, these low-skilled citizens were likely to vote for Marine Le Pen<U+2019>s National Front, while in the U.K. a large majority of those who left school by the age of 16 voted Leave in June<U+2019>s referendum, according to polls. In the U.S., a typical high-school dropout has a lower nominal income today than in 2010, is less likely to own a home or car, has less access to credit, and spends a higher share of income on food (at home) and housing. These are the voters likely to vote for Donald Trump. Those who are part of the world<U+2019>s financial markets<U+2014>traders, fund managers, investors and economists<U+2014>don<U+2019>t match the profile of the group left behind. Financial-market professionals are educated, earn a higher income and live in urban areas. Their political views tend to be reinforced by others in their social circle. The media has only amplified this difference. Websites prompt users to read stories based on other stories they have already read. Blogs rarely include editorial balance. The news flow rapidly reinforces preconceived ideas. The bubble only bursts when it<U+2019>s pierced by democratic reality. This doesn<U+2019>t mean that the political populism of the group left behind will necessarily win the coming elections, including the one in the U.S. next week. But it does mean that the risk pricing implied by betting odds and financial markets can easily be surprised by the reality of politics.

SHEAR \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/us/politics/obama-espn-cmon-man.html?_r=0 \n text: WASHINGTON <U+2014> <U+201C>C<U+2019>mon, man!<U+201D> It has become President Obama <U+2019>s signature phrase on the campaign trail, a rhetorical flourish that he delivers with biting disbelief as he mocks Republicans for outrageous behavior, hypocrisy or obstruction. <U+201C>This is a guy who, like, tweets they should cancel <U+2018> Saturday Night Live ,<U+2019><U+201D> the president bellowed Thursday in Miami , making fun of Donald J. Trump for complaining about Alec Baldwin<U+2019>s portrayal of him. <U+201C>Really? I mean, that<U+2019>s the thing that bothers you, and you want to be president of the United States? C<U+2019>mon, man!<U+201D> If the slogan <U+201C>Fired up! Ready to go!<U+201D> defined Mr. Obama<U+2019>s enthusiasm eight years ago, <U+201C>C<U+2019>mon man!<U+201D> testifies to his exasperation with an election season defined by vitriol and name calling. And it betrays the president<U+2019>s frustration that tens of millions of Americans want Mr. Trump to succeed him. White House speechwriters, who usually do not shrink from accepting praise for artful turns of phrase, say the credit for this one belongs solely to their boss. That raises a question: Where did Mr. Obama pick up the phrase, which began creeping into his stump speech for Hillary Clinton a few months ago? One easy explanation is found in the president<U+2019>s well-known ESPN habit. Mr. Obama often uses his iPad to keep up with the scores of his favorite teams, and the television in the Treaty Room is often tuned to ESPN at night, when Mr. Obama is working through his briefing papers for the next morning. For years, the network has produced a segment on <U+201C>Monday Night Countdown <U+201D> called <U+201C>C<U+2019>mon Man!<U+201D> in which the anchors show particularly ridiculous moments from the weekend<U+2019>s football games, followed by the now-presidential exclamation. This week, the segment featured a referee who threw a flag for unsportsmanlike conduct after receiving an enthusiastic hug from Earl Thomas of the Seattle Seahawks. Thomas later missed a critical tackle, prompting one of the anchors to exclaim: <U+201C>You got to make that tackle, Earl. C<U+2019>mon, man!<U+201D> Seth Markman, a senior producer for N.F.L. studio shows at ESPN, said the link was clear as day when he and others at the network first heard Mr. Obama use the phrase. Mr. Markman mimicked the exasperated <U+201C>we can<U+2019>t believe this guy just did that<U+201D> inflection that is a regular feature of the segment. <U+201C>We immediately said he<U+2019>s watching our show,<U+201D> Mr. Markman said in an interview on Thursday. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s hard to mistake it for anything else. We were flattered, to be honest with you. It<U+2019>s always great when one of these things moves past sports and moves into a bigger pool.<U+201D> The <U+201C>C<U+2019>mon Man!<U+201D> segment began after Keyshawn Johnson, a former player who was an ESPN commentator for years, kept uttering the phrase in the network<U+2019>s private game-watching sessions, Mr. Markman said. Since then, the phrase has taken off, and fans often carry signs emblazoned with it to stadiums. <U+201C>The president saying it the way he<U+2019>s been saying it is really taking it to another level,<U+201D> Mr. Markman said. It is also possible that Mr. Obama is channeling Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has been using the phrase for a while. In September, Mr. Biden ranted about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s tax plan, saying that <U+201C>over 10 years, it<U+2019>ll put us in debt around $9 trillion more, or we<U+2019>re going to have to cut every program out there, counting Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid , by 40 percent.<U+201D> <U+201C>C<U+2019>mon, man!<U+201D> Mr. Biden exclaimed, adding his own regular-guy accent to the phrase. In Reno, Nev., last month, Mr. Biden recalled debating a conservative academic years ago who was arguing that Japan would soon own America. <U+201C>C<U+2019>mon, man!<U+201D> Mr. Biden said to the audience. <U+201C>Raise your hand if you<U+2019>re worried about Japan owning America.<U+201D> But however Mr. Obama picked up the phrase, it has become an expected part of his appearances as he races from battleground state to battleground state in support of Mrs. Clinton. At the rally Thursday in Miami, a member of the audience yelled out the phrase after the president finished a broadside about Republicans<U+2019> obstruction of ideas that they had once championed. <U+201C>I<U+2019>ll be like, well, this is in your Republican handbook; this is in your talking points,<U+201D> the president said, feigning confusion. <U+201C>I thought you all were for this. <U+2018>No, but you<U+2019>re for it now; we can<U+2019>t be for that. I<U+2019>m sorry.<U+2019><U+201D> he added, quoting his adversaries. <U+201C>C<U+2019>mon, man!<U+201D> the audience member shouted. <U+201C>C<U+2019>mon, man!<U+201D> the president dutifully declared, a broad smile crossing his face. In Cleveland last month, Mr. Obama used the phrase twice to punctuate his view that Mr. Trump was anything but a champion for working Americans. <U+201C>All he had time for was celebrities, and now suddenly he<U+2019>s acting like he<U+2019>s a populist out there: <U+2018>Man, I<U+2019>m going to fight for working people,<U+2019><U+201D> Mr. Obama said. <U+201C>C<U+2019>mon, man!<U+201D> Mr. Obama leans on other rhetorical crutches, too: For years, he has responded to loyal crowds that boo at the mention of Republicans with a simple command: <U+201C>Don<U+2019>t boo! Vote!<U+201D> And since 2008, he has sought to reach African-American audiences by urging them to work hard to persuade his fictional Cousin Pookie to get out and vote. <U+201C>I need you to call up Cousin Pookie and say, <U+2018>Pookie, it<U+2019>s time to vote,<U+2019><U+201D> Mr. Obama said at a rally in Las Vegas last month. But <U+201C>C<U+2019>mon, man!<U+201D> may be the most frequent of Mr. Obama<U+2019>s verbal tics. It even popped up when the president held a news conference in London with David Cameron, the prime minister at the time. After a long question by an American reporter, Mr. Obama used his favorite phrase to express his exasperation. <U+201C>Oh, c<U+2019>mon, man!<U+201D> the president said, eliciting a chuckle from the assembled reporters. <U+201C>You<U+2019>re really stretching it.<U+201D> Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the First Draft newsletter .

Source: Yuri Smityuk/TASS \nA full-grown Amur tiger has been caught near the Russian Far Eastern city of Vladivostok and sent for rehabilitation to a special center. The large feline predator is a male weighing 170 kilograms (roughly 375 pounds) that had killed a cow in the town of Artyom about 40 kilometers from Vladivostok, the Amur Tiger Center<U+2019>s press service reported. \n\"On the morning of Oct. 26, a resident of the Artyom town suburb reported to the police that a tiger had killed a cow<U+2026> That same evening a response team from the hunting supervision agency spotted the tiger using an infrared camera. The predator was immediately caught and brought to the Tiger Rehabilitation and Reintroduction Center in the Alekseyevka settlement,\" the Amur Tiger Center said. \nThe tiger will stay at the rehabilitation center while experts determine his future. He may be released into the wild in an area far from human settlements but inhabited with enough ungulates (or hoofed mammals). Ecologists had a similar experience last year, when a tiger named Uporny (or <U+2018>Persistent<U+2019>) who had been attacking dogs in the Khabarovsk region, was caught and later released into a distant area. Tiger cub found prowling the streets of Vladivostok \nOnly a few days ago, another male tiger was caught 20 kilometers away from Vladivostok. The predator not only walked near the city but also entered the city territory. He, too, has been sent to the rehabilitation center. It is a young male tiger weighing 140 kilograms (roughly 308 pounds) who is likely to be released into the wild. \nSeveral weeks ago reports of a tiger were received from Vladivostok<U+2019>s neighboring town of Artyom but the search ended without any success. \nThe Amur tiger is on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. According to the last year<U+2019>s data, at present only 480-540 members of this species live in the wild, with 90 percent of them inhabiting Russia<U+2019>s Far Eastern Primorye and Khabarovsk regions.",

Over the weekend, Sen. Richard Burr noticed a picture of Clinton hanging in a gun shop and decided the owners should put a <U+201C>bullseye<U+201D> on it. \nSpeaking to GOP volunteers on Saturday , Burr joked that he had recently visited a gun shop and <U+201C>nothing made me feel better<U+201D> than seeing a magazine about rifles<U+201C>with a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>I was a little bit shocked at that <U+2014> it didn<U+2019>t have a bullseye on it,<U+201D> Burr told the crowd in Mooresville, North Carolina. <U+201C>But on the bottom right (of the magazine), it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, there<U+2019>s an army of support out there right now for our candidates.<U+201D> \nBurr<U+2019>s comments echo those of his party<U+2019>s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, who has called on the <U+201C>Second Amendment people<U+201D> to <U+201C>do something<U+201D> about his Democratic opponent. However, Burr is at least pretending that he feels bad about his remarks. \nThe Senate Intelligence Committee chairman issued an apology on Monday. <U+201C>The comment I made was inappropriate, and I apologize for it,<U+201D> Burr said. \nA Burr campaign official said the Senator<U+2019>s remark about feeling <U+201C>better<U+201D> had nothing at all to do with the idea of Clinton being shot. Really. He was just referring to the support other right-wing candidates have gotten from various gun rights groups. Honest. \nBurr also said that if he is re-elected and Hillary should happen to win the White House, he will do all he can to continue obstructing the appointment of a ninth Supreme Court justice. When asked about the possibility of Merrick Garland, President Obama<U+2019>s nominee, being appointed, Burr said, <U+201C>it isn<U+2019>t going to happen <U+2014> period.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>And if Hillary Clinton becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the Supreme Court.<U+201D> \nBurr also made it clear that he considers being responsible for the <U+201C>longest judicial vacancy in history<U+201D> a badge of honor. \nYou can listen to Burr fantasize about <U+201C>bullseyes<U+201D> on Hillary Clinton, here : \nFeatured image via Gabriella Demczuk/Getty Images Share this Article!",

        "input": "time: null \n author: IWB \n source: investmentwatchblog.com \n text: Washington, D.C. 20535-0001 \nSir, \nI am writing regarding your public statement in July, 2016 informing the American people that the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton was being closed without referring it to a Federal Grand Jury or the Attorney General of the U. S. for a decision whether or not to indict her. Strangely, you eloquently laid out enough of the evidence deduced from the investigation to strongly indicate there was abundant evidence uncovered during the investigation and interview of her to not only indict but to convict her in Federal Court. However, you personally re-worded and soft-pedaled the actions she took as Secretary of State describing her actions as <U+201C>extremely careless<U+201D> in using a personal email and un-secured server for her communications while Secretary of State. You rewrote the statute, which is not your job. \nAs a retired Special Agent of the FBI, I have standing to write this letter. My thirty years in law enforcement, including 22 years as a Special Agent with the FBI have given me the knowledge, expertise and experience to question and confront you for your perplexing actions, which (as you well know) were outside the normal standard operating procedure of the FBI and Federal judicial procedures. Some of the finest people in the world proudly carry the credentials of FBI Agent and you have soiled them and not allowed them to speak. But I will not be silent. \nSorry, but NO SIR, MS Clinton was not merely careless or extremely careless. She was not even negligent or grossly negligent (as the statute requires). Hillary Clinton was knowingly purposeful in her decisions and actions to set up a server under her exclusive control and possession in order to control what information was available to the American public and Congress regarding her actions as Secretary of State. Furthermore, she took those government owned communications into her personal possession after leaving her position and knowingly and willingly attempted to destroy them so her nefarious actions could never be known or used as evidence of her corrupt moral character against her. \nSir, what possessed you? Did you cave in to political pressure to unilaterally come to this decision? I fear that is the case, and Rule of Law be damned. I am embarrassed for and ashamed of you. You have set a precedent that can never be rectified<U+2026> and certainly not justified. Shame on you, Sir. You ought to resign right now in disgrace for what you have done to tarnish the reputation of the finest Law Enforcement Agency in the world<U+2026> for entirely political reasons. \nNormally, an investigation will be assigned to an agent, or team of agents with one being the Case agent, or the lead investigator. When the investigation is complete, an investigative report will be presented to the U.S. Attorney for the Federal District involved. It would be the U.S. Attorney who decides whether to decline prosecution for that investigation<U+2026> NOT the FBI agent. But in the Clinton investigation, YOU (unilaterally) decided not to forward the investigation to the U.S. Attorney or the Attorney General of the U.S., but instead personally made the decision not to prosecute her or even provide the information to a Federal Grand Jury. You were wrong to take this upon yourself. \nSir, in order to indict a subject, only a preponderance of evidence, or 51% is needed for probable cause to exist. You did not think even that level of probability existed? Who do you think you are fooling? What judicial proceeding did you think you were following? \nThroughout my years with the FBI, I (along with my fellow agents) took great pride in conducting each investigation in an unbiased manner regardless of the subject<U+2019>s position or standing in the community. \nAll were treated equally under the law. But you, Sir, decided to allow this corrupt, evil and nasty human being to go free and unchallenged for her treasonous actions (yes, treasonous, in my opinion) which threatened the security of this nation. Furthermore, you stopped short of investigating the Clinton Foundation as a RICO case (Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization. This is a RICO case ifthere ever were one. Even an untrained person can tell from the communications which were recovered that Hillary Clinton spent more time working for the Clinton Foundation while Secretary of State than on State Business. It may be argued that Hillary did not do any State business UNLESS the Clinton Foundation benefitted. You decided to just let this uncomfortable truth alone without addressing it. \nI will conclude with this: Following my retirement from the FBI, I volunteered for a 12 month tour of duty in Afghanistan as a Law Enforcement Professional, embedded with U.S. forces as a subject matter expert in counter-terrorism investigations. For most of that year I operated <U+201C>outside the wire<U+201D> patrolling with the troops, interviewing witnesses to IED incidents and gathering evidence on the bad guys. The results of my work would then be reported through secure channels to the Commanding Officer. All reports and communications were required to be transmitted via secure and encrypted devices. Occasionally my remote location in the mountains of Afghanistan made transmission impossible and I would have to fly back to Bagram Air Base in order to securely report to the Commander of the battle space. It would have been convenient if I could have just called the Commander on my personal cell phone or written him an email on my personal laptop. But, had I done so I would have been reporting classified information via an unsecured device and it could have been compromised. These were, relative to Secretary of State communications, low level classifications of Secret. Had I ever sent even one in such a manner I would have been prosecuted and sent to Federal Prison for 20 years or so. That is how serious this violation is considered. \nNow, because of you, Hillary Clinton is allowed to continue her RICO activities and is running for President of the United States, the most powerful position in the world. You have trampled on the Rule of Law and destroyed the trust of the American people in the FBI and in unbiased enforcement of the law. How do you sleep at night? It is time for you to go and work for the Clinton Foundation. \nSincerely,",

Oh and he also said that wanting to make American great again was racist. \nThe Daily Beast published an interview with Hawke, gracing us with the musings of a man who should stick to memorizing the lines that someone else wrote for him. Then again, that<U+2019>s what he did, he spewed liberal talking points. This is also known as the <U+201C>stuff people incapable of higher level thinking<U+201D> say in interviews to get attention. \n<U+201C>When you see a man, if he wins, threatening to put his opponent in jail?<U+201D> Hawke said in reference to Donald Trump promising that he would hold Clinton accountable for breaking the law. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s fascist behavior.<U+201D> \nYeah, you guys (oops, I forgot that<U+2019>s sexist but fortunately I also just remembered that I don<U+2019>t care). Anyway, Hawke may not understand how the law works, but it<U+2019>s pretty simple, even for him. If you break a law, consequences are supposed to follow. \nFor most of us, there are consequences, but Clinton has been held to a different set of standards than the rest of us. Just ask retired 4-star Gen. James Cartwright how that works <U+2014> he<U+2019>s facing jail time and a fine for doing something quite similar to Clinton yet she<U+2019>s still running for president. \nLet<U+2019>s take a gander at the definition of Fascism from Dictionary.com : \nnoun \n1. \n( sometimes initial capital letter ) a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism. \nAll you have to do is swap out <U+201C>nationalism<U+201D> for <U+201C>globalism<U+201D> and that definition fits Clinton like a glove. Complete power, suppression of free speech, control of the economy, globalism, and racism are Clinton<U+2019>s platform. \nLiberals like to throw the word fascism around because they think it makes them sound smart, but far more often than not the fascist label is much more befitting of the liberal candidate than the conservative, and in this case especially, it is a fine example of what a Clinton presidency would look like. \nHawke also called Trump<U+2019>s campaign slogan, <U+201C>Make America Great Again, racist in the interview. <U+201C>What <U+2018>Make America Great Again<U+2019> means is not lost on any of us,<U+201D> Hawke said. <U+201C>It means <U+2018>white<U+2019> and <U+2018>male.'<U+201D> \nIs that what it meant when former President Bill Clinton used it during his wife<U+2019>s 2008 presidential campaign? If so, boy, that makes things awkward, doesn<U+2019>t it? Slick Willy also used the phrase back in 1992 during his own campaign.",

LOUIS<U+2014> Donald Trump followed through on his threats to bring Bill Clinton <U+2019>s sexual history to the presidential debate stage and to bring his accusers into the debate hall. He lashed out at the former president after being questioned over a 2005 recording, which surfaced Friday, in which the Republican presidential nominee is heard speaking in vulgar terms about making sexually aggressive moves toward women. He said Mr. Clinton <U+2019>s actions were worse than his words. <U+201C>No one in the history of this nation has been as abusive to women,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women.<U+201D> He then ticked through consequences Mr. Clinton suffered: being impeached, losing his law license and paying a legal settlement. Over the years, Mrs. Clinton has mostly avoided responding to claims about her husband, and at the debate, Mrs. Clinton declined to engage in the details of those decades-old charges. A spokesman for Mr. Clinton had no comment earlier Sunday. <U+201C>So much of what he<U+2019>s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton said at the debate. <U+201C>When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: <U+2018>When they go low, you go high.<U+2019> <U+201D> Ahead of the debate, Mr. Trump held a media event with women who had accused the former president of sexual misconduct, and he then sat Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey in the audience. <U+201C>Actions speak louder than words,<U+201D> said Ms. Broaddrick who claimed Mr. Clinton raped her in 1978. <U+201C>Mr. Trump may have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me.<U+201D> The former president has denied the Broaddrick accusations, and he wasn<U+2019>t charged with a crime. Capital Journal is WSJ.com<U+2019>s home for Election 2016 news. The group in St. Louis also included Kathy Shelton, who criticized Mrs. Clinton for defending a man charged with raping her when she was 12 years old. Mrs. Clinton was helping lead a legal aid clinic at the University of Arkansas at the time. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri called the event an <U+201C>act of desperation.<U+201D> <U+201C>We<U+2019>re not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom,<U+201D> Ms. Palmieri said. <U+201C>Hillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn<U+2019>t change that.<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton has mostly avoided responding to claims about her husband. Early Sunday, Mr. Clinton<U+2019>s sexual past was put into the spotlight with a new video featuring Ms. Broaddrick, who volunteered on his 1978 campaign for Arkansas governor. She repeated her allegations that Mr. Clinton raped her nearly four decades ago. Ms. Broaddrick previously made conflicting statements regarding the encounter. In 1997, she made sworn statements denying the alleged rape in a harassment lawsuit against the then-president by Ms. Jones, a former state employee. In 1998, she repudiated those statements and said Mr. Clinton had raped her. Ms. Broaddrick renewed the allegations in an interview posted Sunday by the conservative website Breitbart.com, which Mr. Trump on Sunday morning linked to in a tweet. <U+201C>I kept telling him, <U+2018>No, I don<U+2019>t want this at all,<U+2019> and I<U+2019>m sure I must have said, <U+2018>You must have had the wrong idea.<U+2019> And he wouldn<U+2019>t listen, you know there was no way he would listen to what I was saying,<U+201D> she says in the new video, recounting the alleged incident, said to have taken place in a Little Rock, Ark., hotel in 1978. <U+201C>He tore the waist of my skirt, and then he ripped my pantyhose and he raped me. It was very vicious. I was just pinned down and it was a very helpless situation. I didn<U+2019>t know what to do.<U+201D> Ms. Broaddrick asserts that Mrs. Clinton implied to her later that year at a campaign event that she knew of the hotel incident. Ms. Broaddrick says she interpreted Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s thanks for her volunteer work as a signal to conceal their encounter. <U+201C>I felt like she knew<U+2026>and she was telling me to keep quiet,<U+201D> Ms. Broaddrick says in the video. That allegation surfaced only after Mrs. Clinton launched her campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2000. A spokesman for Mr. Clinton had no comment. Ms. Willey, a former White House aide, accused Mr. Clinton of groping her in his office in 1993, though she had earlier given a deposition saying she had no memory of such an incident. Mr. Clinton denied the charge, and an independent prosecutor concluded there was insufficient evidence to charge him. Ms. Jones sued Mr. Clinton for sexual harassment in 1994, alleging that while he was governor he exposed himself to her in a Little Rock hotel. It was settled in 1998 for $850,000, without any admission of wrongdoing by Mr. Clinton. The case led to a significant blemish on the presidency, however, triggering investigations that through a convoluted path led eventually to a House impeachment of Mr. Clinton for lying to investigators. The Senate acquitted Mr. Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice charges in 1999. In January 1992, the Clintons granted a joint interview to <U+201C>60 Minutes<U+201D> to respond to claims by Gennifer Flowers, a former television reporter and cabaret singer, that she had an affair with the Arkansas politician in the 1970s and 1980s. <U+201C>When this woman first got caught up in these charges, I felt, as I<U+2019>ve felt about all of these women, that they<U+2019>ve just been minding their own business and they got hit by a meteor,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton said in the <U+201C>60 Minutes<U+201D> interview, apparently referring to media inquiries about her husband<U+2019>s sexual history. <U+201C>I felt terrible about what was happening to them,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton said. In a private conversation with a close friend, Mrs. Clinton referred to Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern who had an affair with Mr. Clinton, as a <U+201C>narcissistic<U+00A0>loony<U+00A0>toon,<U+201D> according to a diary kept by the friend, Diane Blair, that was included in her public papers after her death.

Average bonuses were around $15,000. However, it turns out that only certain enlisted soldiers in specific intelligence, civl affairs, and non-commissioned officer roles were eligible for these bonuses, according to CNN . \nThe call-back from the Pentagon was going to set people back an extraordinary amount of money, dollars that these people had come to depend on. Because of the government<U+2019>s mistakes, those who served in the military were going to be forced to give that money back. \nHowever, the Pentagon is issuing a reversal of that order. \nFox News reported : \nBRUSSELS <U+2013> U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter has ordered the Pentagon to stop seeking repayments of enlistment bonuses given to California National Guard members who served overseas. \nHis decision comes in the wake of angry reaction from members of Congress who demanded he relieve the burden on the Guard members. And the White House said President Barack Obama has warned the Defense Department not to <U+201C>nickel and dime<U+201D> service members who were victims of fraud by overzealous recruiters. \nIn a statement issued during a meeting of defense ministers in Brussels, Carter said effort to collect reimbursement should stop <U+201C>as soon as is practical<U+201D> and will continue until a process to help the troops deal with the problem is worked out. \nIt is a good thing that those who received these bonuses are not being forced to give them back. Granting of enlistment bonuses to those who were not eligible is a bad mistake that is the fault of the government, not the soldiers being deployed. The soldiers and their families should not have to suffer hardship for mistakes made by top Pentagon officials. \nUnfortunately, this is just the latest in a long history of reckless handling of finances by the Pentagon. I recently reported on how the Pentagon cannot account for over $6.5 trillion in its budget. That<U+2019>s trillion with a T. \nYet where is the outrage? It<U+2019>s almost non-existent. Maybe it<U+2019>s because we don<U+2019>t fathom how much a trillion really is. \nNonetheless, the Pentagon needs to be reined in. Their pattern of reckless spending is not one that can be tolerated. (And, no, effectively punishing the troops for top officials<U+2019> mistakes is not an option).",

Now Discovery is making a big play, investing $100 million into a newly-formed holding company made up of digital properties in the Lerer family<U+2019>s digital media empire, The Wall Street Journal reports. The new company, called Group Nine Media, will include Thrillist (started by Ben Lerer, the son of venture capitalist Kenneth Lerer), the Dodo (founded by Mr. Lerer<U+2019>s daughter Izzie Lerer) NowThis (founded by the elder Mr. Lerer and his VC partner Eric Hippeau) and two of Discovery<U+2019>s digital ventures. The deal valued the new company, which will be run by Ben Lerer, at around $550 million, and Discovery will have the option to buy a controlling stake in two years. David Zaslav, Discovery<U+2019>s CEO, said the investment in the social-media geared company is a part of Discovery<U+2019>s efforts to <U+201C>accelerate our presence in short-form content.<U+201D> NIGHT OF BUZZ : On election night, viewers will have their choice of networks to follow along with the action, but just like with the conventions and presidential debates, Twitter is hoping young viewers will use its platform to tune in instead. As CMO Today reports, BuzzFeed will live stream an election night special on Twitter , where reporters will deliver and analyze incoming news throughout the evening. The move is the latest in a growing list of sports and politics live-streaming deals for Twitter. But it<U+2019>s perhaps a more surprising move from BuzzFeed, which was the highest-paid publisher on Facebook<U+2019>s list of media companies getting compensated to produce Facebook Live videos. Ben Smith, BuzzFeed<U+2019>s editor in chief, said that Twitter is still <U+201C>the heart of this giant American conversation<U+201D> surrounding the election. The two companies will split advertising revenue generated from the event, which will include typical mid-roll video ads and sponsored news clips promoted across Twitter. TRUMPED UP ADS : Donald Trump<U+2019>s entire campaign has been a lesson in the power of free media (that is, publicity that you don<U+2019>t have to pay for). But as WSJ reports, that strategy might be catching up with Mr. Trump as he and Hillary Clinton flood the airwaves in swing states with ads in the campaign<U+2019>s final stretch. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s team booked her ads earlier, meaning she can command a better price than Mr. Trump, at least at first. FCC filings show that the Trump campaign initially pays higher rates in key states than Clinton, though the Trump campaign sometimes will receive rebates from the stations. The Trump campaign said last month that it would spend $100 million on TV ads before Election Day, but so far it has booked about half of that. IT<U+2019>S TWITCHY : Twitch, the video game streaming service acquired by Amazon in 2014 for a staggering $1 billion, is well-known among gamers and gaming advertisers. But as CMO Today reports, the company is landing ad deals outside of its category in the hopes of winning a bigger share of the web video ad dollar pool. Brands that have recently advertised on Twitch include Coke, Pepsi, Old Spice and Pizza Hut <U+2013> all marketers that want to tap into Twitch<U+2019>s command of the hard-to-reach young male demographic. Twitch says it averages close to 10 million daily active users across the globe, through platforms like YouTube and Facebook have more mammoth reach. Also, ad buyers are often jumpy about placing their brands in newer, riskier spaces. Twitch says this isn<U+2019>t a problem anymore. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve disproven or blown away stereotypes. Our conversations are no longer around <U+2018>is this audience safe?<U+2019><U+201D> said Anthony Danzi, Twitch<U+2019>s senior vice president of client strategy.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Daniel Greenfield \n source: freedomoutpost.com \n text: Print \nThe headlines are in. Trump is the <U+201C>anti-Democratic<U+201D> candidate because he refuses to rule out challenging the results of an election that has yet to take place. Such a course of action is <U+201C>beyond the pale.<U+201D> It<U+2019>s a threat to democracy. And it is utterly and thoroughly unacceptable. \nExcept when Democrats do it. \nIt was the day after the election. While the Democratic Party faithful waited in the rain in Nashville, William Daley strode out and announced, <U+201C>Our campaign continues.<U+201D> Al Gore had called George W. Bush to withdraw his concession. <U+201C>Are you saying what I think you<U+2019>re saying?\" a baffled Bush asked. <U+201C>You don<U+2019>t have to be snippy about it,\" Gore retorted snippily. \nGore did eventually concede. Though years later he would attempt to retract his concession a second time. But his political movement never did concede. It remained a widespread belief in left-wing circles that President Bush was illegitimately elected and that President Gore was the real winner. \nHow mainstream is that belief? \nWhen Hillary dragged Gore away from playing with his Earth globe to campaign for her, the crowd booed at his mention of the election and then chanted, <U+201C>You won, you won.<U+201D> \nHillary grinned and nodded. \nHillary Clinton has always believed that President Bush illegitimately took office. She has told Democrats that Bush was <U+201C>selected<U+201D> rather than <U+201C>elected<U+201D>. In Nigeria, of all places, she implied that Jeb Bush had rigged the election for his brother. \nBut it<U+2019>s not unprecedented, beyond the pale or utterly unacceptable when Democrats do it. \nIt<U+2019>s just business as usual. \nThe media<U+2019>s focus has been on whether Trump would accept the results if he loses. Yet a better question might be whether Hillary Clinton would accept her defeat. \nEven when it came to the battle for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton refused to concede defeat until the bitter end and then past it. Not only did Hillary refuse to drop out even when Obama was the clear winner, while her people threatened a convention floor fight, but she insisted on staying on in the race for increasingly bizarre and even downright disturbing reasons. \nIn South Dakota, Hillary explained that there was no reason for her to drop out because somebody might shoot Barack Obama, \"We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.\" \nThere<U+2019>s something disturbing in the revelation that Hillary was basing her decision to stay in the race in the hope that her rival would be assassinated. \nObama<U+2019>s spokesman said that her remark <U+201C>has no place in this campaign<U+201D>. But it had a place inside Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s very warped brain which preferred to see Obama die than concede the election to him. \nIf that<U+2019>s how Hillary felt about a fellow Democrat, imagine how she feels about Trump. \nEven after Obama had clinched the delegate votes, Hillary<U+2019>s speech brought back the Gore argument insisting that, <U+201C>Nearly 18 million of you cast your votes for our campaign, carrying the popular vote with more votes than any primary candidate in history. Even when the pundits and the naysayers proclaimed week after week that this race was over, you kept on voting.<U+201D> \nThen the fabulously wealthy Hillary asked those 18 million people to go to her website and give her money while refusing to make any decision on ending her campaign. It took her another day to do that. \nIt<U+2019>s not as if the Obama side was any better. It was arguably worse. Governor Wilder, an Obama ally, threatened a return of the 1968 Chicago Democratic convention riots if Hillary won. \"If you think 1968 was bad, you watch; in 2008, it will be worse,<U+201D> Wilder warned. \nUnprecedented. Outrageous. Beyond the pale. Except this is how Democrats act even to each other. \nNow how would they respond to a Trump victory? Would they urge Hillary to concede or to fight on? Would they stage more riots while claiming voter disenfranchisement had stolen the election? \nHillary Clinton has made it clear that she views Trump<U+2019>s candidacy as illegitimate. She has called him <U+201C>unfit<U+201D> and described his supporters as <U+201C>deplorables.<U+201D> Democrats, all the way up to the White House, are constantly accusing Republicans of scheming to disenfranchise voters. These <U+201C>schemes<U+201D> involve asking undocumented Democrats to show some ID instead of relying on an honor system and removing illegitimate voters from the rolls. But beyond enabling voter fraud, such arguments can easily be employed to attack the legitimacy of a Republican winner. They provide the fodder for another Florida. \nDoes anyone really believe that Hillary Clinton, who couldn<U+2019>t even graciously concede to Obama will graciously concede to Trump? \nAnd, given the fact that Hillary won the nomination by using the DNC to rig the process, leading to the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz , are Trump<U+2019>s concerns of a rigged election illegitimate? \nDonald Trump has clarified that he would accept <U+201C>a clear election result<U+201D> but that he was <U+201C>being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters.<U+201D> \nAnd he<U+2019>s right. No one preemptively cedes elections. And Hillary Clinton has faced accusations of abusive and fraudulent tactics from Democratic rivals in two different presidential elections. \nWhy should Republicans assume that she<U+2019>ll treat them better than she treated Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders? \nNot all that long ago, the left wanted Gore to fight to the bitter end. A Gore adviser recalled, \"People were calling us from everywhere, telling us, 'Don't concede.'\" Left-wing voices urged Bernie Sanders to stay in the race long after it became obvious that the left-winger had no realistic path to victory left. \nBut the same behavior that is virtuous when Democrats do it becomes an unpardonable sin when Republicans take it up. \nThat<U+2019>s a pernicious double standard that cannot and should not be allowed to stand. \nWhen Democrats warn of voter disenfranchisement, the media backs them up. When Republicans complain about voter fraud, they are accused of voter suppression. When Democrats fight elections past the point that they<U+2019>re lost, then they are courageous. But when Republicans do it, they are a threat to democracy. \nBut democracy does not mean Democratic Party rule. That<U+2019>s just the mistake that the media makes. \nWhatever rules we have, run both ways. Any practices, new or old, also apply to both sides. If challenging election results is legitimate, then it is so for both sides. Whatever options were available to Gore and Hillary cannot help but be available to Trump. \nThat is how democracy, rather than Democratic Party rule, works. \nArticle reposted with permission from Sultan Knish shares",

And the swamp will just suck you in if you let it. So he needs to have a very, very aggressive first year.<U+201D> Story Continued Below Gingrich said Trump must be a <U+201C>salesman<U+201D> as president, loudly backing the package of proposals he will try to enact once he assumes office. It is especially important, Gingrich said, that Trump seek bipartisan cooperation wherever possible and floated a massive infrastructure project as one issue where he might find a willing ally in incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats. <U+201C>I think it's very important that Trump try to have as many Democrats as possible help him do this,<U+201D> the former House speaker said. <U+201C>Because one of the lessons of the Obama years is, if you do things that are big on a purely partisan basis, they're not stable.

Not just for eight years.<U+201D> Trump<U+2019>s loss in the popular vote to Hillary Clinton will <U+201C>to some extent<U+201D> prove a challenge, Gingrich said, but he also noted that the former secretary of state<U+2019>s higher overall vote total is largely the result of her running up the score in California, where the GOP does not compete. The former House speaker has previously voiced support for doing away with the Electoral College and said Sunday that <U+201C>in the long run, you want to find a way to have the whole country represented.<U+201D> By Louis Nelson Gingrich dismissed as <U+201C>garbage<U+201D> the notion that Trump<U+2019>s candidacy had somehow given voice to the <U+201C>alt-right,<U+201D> a movement attacked often as promoting racist, misogynistic and anti-Semitic rhetoric. Instead, Gingrich said the president-elect is <U+201C>a mainstream conservative who wants to profoundly take on the left.<U+201D> He recommended that Trump remain himself once he assumes the presidency and <U+201C>the country will organize itself around who he is.<U+201D> As for Trump<U+2019>s prolific and often bombastic Twitter account, Gingrich said: <U+201C>My advice to that is to always have an editor.<U+201D> He said the social media platform, which has gotten Trump into hot water on occasion, is a powerful means of communicating directly with the public without having to go through a media outlet that might distort the message he is seeking to convey. <U+201C>Donald should [keep tweeting],<U+201D> Gingrich said. <U+201C>I mean, look, it's a technique for reaching 13 or 14 million people at no cost and gets him around the New York Times.<U+201D> By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

Keith Ellison is among those competing for the top DNC spot.  | Getty By Gabriel Debenedetti 11/29/16 09:34 PM EST Top Democratic officials in four Rust Belt states that voted for Donald Trump earlier this month have invited the candidates for the Democratic National Committee chairmanship to formally share their thoughts on how the party can compete there at a meeting next month. A letter obtained by POLITICO and circulated by officials with the Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania Democratic parties on Tuesday evening invites the candidates to the Ohio group<U+2019>s executive committee meeting on Dec. 10. Story Continued Below <U+201C>As Chairs and Vice Chairs of states in the industrial Midwest <U+2014> traditional bellwether or <U+2018>red<U+2019> states <U+2014> we are particularly concerned to hear the ideas and plans you and other candidates have to help us turn this critical region blue again. How will you continue to energize the coalition that has performed so well to elect Democrats at times, while also making inroads in the areas where President-Elect Trump did so well across our states? We are also eager to share our ideas,<U+201D> the letter reads. <U+201C>Bottom line: We<U+2019>d be honored to have you come to our region to hear directly from Democrats, present your plans and ideas, and engage our grassroots activists who are eager to be part of the conversation.\" If any of the candidates accept, the letter notes, the hosts will invite all DNC members to attend. Congress By Elana Schor and Seung Min Kim After Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s shocking loss nationwide, and in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin <U+2014> in addition to the more expected defeats in states like Indiana, Iowa and Ohio <U+2014> party leaders have been trying to determine their candidates<U+2019> path forward in the region. And the question of how to balance appealing to Trump supporters and the coalitions that backed Barack Obama twice is a central one as Democrats also search for a replacement for interim DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile. While DNC members will not vote on a new chairperson until late February, four Democrats have already thrown their hats into the ring: Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, former Vermont governor and DNC chairman Howard Dean, South Carolina Democratic Party chairman Jaime Harrison, and New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Ray Buckley, who is also a vice-chairman of the DNC. Other prominent Democrats, including NARAL chief Ilyse Hogue and Labor Secretary Tom Perez, are also weighing bids of their own. The signatories to Tuesday night<U+2019>s invitation were Indiana Chair John Zody and Vice-Chair Cordelia Lewis Black, Michigan Chair Brandon Dillon and Vice Chair Nancy Quarles, Ohio Chair David Pepper and Vice Chair Rhine McLin, and Pennsylvania Chair Marcel Groen.

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/fords-tango-with-trump-1479682041 \n text: Ford Motor Co. announced late last week that it won<U+2019>t shift production of its Lincoln MKC to Mexico from Louisville, Kentucky, as planned. This is good news if Ford believes that Donald Trump will make the U.S. more competitive but a bad precedent if it is bending to the President-elect<U+2019>s political wishes. The U.S. auto maker had intended to move production of its MKC, a luxury crossover SUV, to Mexico to increase output of the higher-volume Escape at its Louisville plant, which is operating at full capacity. While this cross-border migration would not have jeopardized American jobs (which are protected by the United Auto Workers labor agreement), keeping the MKC in Kentucky could lead to more domestic investment. In a statement, Ford said that <U+201C>we are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness.<U+201D> CFO Bob Shanks noted on a conference call that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s promises to cut taxes and increase public-works spending could <U+201C>provide an environment where it makes economic sense to build back up manufacturing jobs here.<U+201D> This seems to have displeased many progressives who have spent the last eight years denying that the Obama Administration<U+2019>s tax and regulatory policies have depressed investment. Ford<U+2019>s decision is also a counterpoint to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s claim that the U.S. needs to renegotiate trade deals and impose protective tariffs to bring back manufacturing jobs. Make the U.S. more competitive and more businesses will come<U+2014>or stay. According to the Tax Foundation, the U.S. marginal effective tax rate on capital investment (35.3%) is the highest in the industrial world and twice as high as in Mexico (17.4%) and Canada (18.6%). The effective rate for U.S. manufacturers is much higher than for, say, real estate. Mr. Trump has proposed cutting the corporate tax rate to 15% from 35% and allowing U.S. companies to repatriate income already earned abroad at a 10% rate. His plan would also allow manufacturers to fully expense their capital investment. While the details have to be negotiated with Congress, corporate tax reform has broad support among Republicans as well as some Democrats including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has indicated a willingness to cut a deal in return for more domestic spending. According to the Washington Post, Ford officials also said privately that they believe Mr. Trump would ease fuel-economy standards imposed by President Obama in 2012. This would be more good economic news. The onerous mileage rules, which require an average fleet efficiency of nearly 50 miles per gallon by 2025, are up for review next year. Ford has been shifting production of its low-margin small cars that are needed to comply with fuel-economy rules to Mexico where labor costs are lower. Scaling back the regulations would improve Ford<U+2019>s profit margins and allow it to invest more in making more profitable trucks and SUVs in the U.S. Replacing the Affordable Care Act would also be a boon. Ford<U+2019>s health-care costs have been rising fast in part due to ObamaCare<U+2019>s benefit mandates. The United Auto Workers last year estimated that health-care costs per union worker will increase 63% by 2019. The law<U+2019>s 40% tax on expensive <U+201C>Cadillac<U+201D> plans will also take effect in 2018. Escalating health-care costs impinge on business investment and make American workers less competitive. A major caveat here is that Ford has been the most protectionist U.S. car company and vigorously opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would reduce the 25% tariff on Japanese trucks. Ford has also been hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar and urged sanctions on Japan for manipulating its currency, though the yen was overvalued for many years. During his campaign, Mr. Trump accused Japan of <U+201C>monetary manipulation<U+201D> and suggested he might impose tariffs on imports. The U.S. doesn<U+2019>t need politicians dictating where companies can invest, and it would be bad news if Ford<U+2019>s announcement is one half of an implicit bargain in return for an expectation that Mr. Trump will increase tariffs on imported cars. Ford<U+2019>s MKC reversal shows how pursuing pro-growth policies will encourage business investment, but only if it doesn<U+2019>t herald a new era of politicized investment.",

A new round of leaked emails shows a string of Clinton aides chewing over campaign messages large and small as she moved through the Democratic primary and into the general election showdown with Republican rival Donald Trump. The emails underline Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s image as a highly scripted, deeply cautious candidate, and perhaps provide clues as to how she might operate if she wins the presidency. The emails, released over the past several days by WikiLeaks , came from a hack of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta <U+2019>s email account. They offer an unusually revealing look at the internal thinking that shapes Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s public utterances. Few presidential candidates wing it in the trail. But the notes flying back and forth among her staff show that even lines meant to sound spontaneous, as well as seemingly off-the-cuff tweets, are scrupulously vetted. Mr. Trump has harshly criticized Mrs. Clinton as inauthentic and calculating, while she has hit back at him as unprepared and volatile. The emails suggest than even some of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s supporters have worried her campaign may be overly controlled. One came from Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who in July 2015 sent a note to a Clinton adviser saying the campaign <U+201C>feels stale, with very few signs of the kind of freshness and transparency that the American people (especially millennials) will need to trust and ultimately elect HRC as president.<U+201D> The Clinton campaign neither confirmed nor denied the authenticity of the emails on Monday, repeating an approach it took with a batch of emails released by WikiLeaks last week. But<U+00A0>the campaign blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for unearthing them, suggesting he did so to aid Mr. Trump. <U+201C>The timing shows you that even Putin knows Trump had a bad weekend and a bad debate,<U+201D> the campaign said in a prepared statement. U.S. intelligence agencies issued a joint statement last week accusing Russia of trying to influence the U.S. election, including by hacking internal documents and releasing them on WikiLeaks. Mr. Trump, in Sunday<U+2019>s presidential debate, questioned not only Russia<U+2019>s role but whether hacking was even occurring. The latest batch of emails also opens a window into personal relations within the Clinton camp, including the fraying of ties between Doug Band<U+2014>a former White House aide and longtime confidant to Bill Clinton <U+2014>and the former president<U+2019>s daughter, Chelsea. Mr. Band stayed with Mr. Clinton after the White House and helped set up his charitable foundation. In recent years, Ms. Clinton has taken on a larger role at the foundation. In an email to Mr. Podesta in November 2011, Mr. Band, while talking about the business consulting company he co-founded, Teneo Holdings, criticized Ms. Clinton. He said she was <U+201C>acting like a spoiled brat kid<U+201D> and had <U+201C>a lack of focus in her life.<U+201D> The context of the criticism isn't clear, and Mr. Band declined to comment. Ms. Clinton, in her own email to Mr. Podesta in December, 2011, voiced concerns that her father<U+2019>s name was being used in Britain on behalf of Teneo clients. <U+201C>I will raise all of this and more with my father this evening,<U+201D> she wrote. Ms. Clinton<U+2019>s office didn't reply to a request for comment. The latest disclosure in addition shows that when Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) took to Twitter in July 2015 to criticize Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s views on Cuba, several Clinton campaign officials debated how to respond in a series of internal emails. They tested out possible rejoinders against Mr. Rubio, then a top GOP presidential hopeful, in 140 characters. As the conversation continued, more campaign officials were added to the email chain, as a mix of policy and communications aides discussed such questions as whether to include the Republican senator<U+2019>s Twitter handle. Notably, this tweet-by-committee was to be signed by <U+201C>-H,<U+201D> a designation that is supposed to signify that a tweet came directly from Mrs. Clinton. In the end, this response was tweeted from the former secretary of state<U+2019>s account: <U+201C>@marcorubio You<U+2019>ve got it backwards: Engagement is a threat to the Castros, not a gift. Embargo hasn<U+2019>t worked for 50+ years. -H<U+201D> Over the course of more than four hours one day in October 2015, some of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s closest advisers went back and forth on whether she should tell a joke about Donald Trump<U+2019>s hair. Mr. Podesta, in an email to speechwriter Dan Schwerin and more than a dozen other top advisers, suggested Mrs. Clinton tell a joke referring to her 11 hours of testimony before the House Benghazi committee chaired by Rep. Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.). The speech was to be given later that day at a fundraising dinner for the Iowa Democratic Party. <U+201C>On freshening things up,<U+201D> Mr. Podesta began, <U+201C>what about: I used to be obsessed with Donald Trump<U+2019>s hair, that was until I got to spend 11 hours staring at the top of Trey Gowdy<U+2019>s head.<U+201D> <U+201C>LOVE the Trey Gowdy line,<U+201D> replied Mandy Grunwald, a longtime communications adviser to the Clintons. <U+201C>Just wonder if that undercuts our statesmanship point too much.<U+201D> Mr. Podesta responded, <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think so.<U+201D> Communications director Jennifer Palmieri fired back, <U+201C>That<U+2019>s because you love your own joke. But I think it is OK.<U+201D> Joel Benenson, the campaign<U+2019>s pollster, had the last word: <U+201C>We own the high ground right now. We should stay there.<U+201D> In another email thread, top staffers discussed the editing of a particular document, apparently a speech Mrs. Clinton was supposed to give. The speech wasn't attached to the email, but after a few rounds of edits, one staffer wrote, <U+201C>Is everyone comfortable w her saying <U+201D>Yo Mama\"? <U+201C>Yikes,<U+201D> wrote back another staffer. The exchange was an apparent reference to a coming visit by Mrs. Clinton to a restaurant in Birmingham, Ala., called <U+201D>Yo<U+2019> Mama<U+2019>s.<U+201D> <U+2014>Colleen McCain Nelson, James V.

The world is changing quickly and much is at stake. It is even possible that our entire global civilization will collapse in our lifetime. This is a very difficult concept to sit with <U+2014> yet sit with it we must, for now is a time of great consequences. A four hundred year old economic system is dying. We can feel the pain all around us. It shivers in the outstretched hands of the homeless. Gets expressed as death rattles in the species going extinct on a daily basis. Entire societies have tattered the social fabric of trust as inequality skyrocketed in the last few decades. It is experienced as fear, anger, sadness, humiliation, shame, and despair. Every person alive today has a responsibility to bear witness, provide hospice care to the dying, and participate in midwifing new ways to structure social life. This is our burden to be alive in the early part of the 21st Century. Yet so many among us are still behaving like children. They call each other names. Pick fights between parochial tribal groups. Bitch and moan when things don<U+2019>t go their way. And hoard precious wealth in a time of increasing global scarcity. Now is the time to behave like grownups. Because the threats now upon us are very serious. I say this as a man who is about to become a father. My wife and I chose <U+2014> with eyes wide open <U+2014> to bring a child into this world in the midst of great upheaval. We believe deeply and firmly in humanity and are investing our blood in the future. This is not something we do lightly. It is a great responsibility to continue the human race even as billions starve and there now lurks a very real possibility that our child will live through the collapse of the Earth<U+2019>s first globalized civilization. This unborn child has prospects to live into the 22nd Century. What will be seen through their eyes? Will there be a saga of unraveling the biosphere for our precious home planet? Might the death throes of capitalism take down the safety nets of a stable climate? Will our child bear witness to the final days of humanity? We cannot say even how long his or her survival will be secure. Yet we carry forth knowing what must be done. Humanity is in the crucible of change now. It is an all-hands-on-deck transition <U+2014> away from life destroying economic practices based on wealth hoarding and extraction and toward life affirming practices of regeneration and renewal. Let me state this seriously and succinctly. According to the Stockholm Resilience Institute, there are nine <U+201C>planetary boundaries<U+201D> that represent thresholds for a viable global civilization. Cross even one and the entire edifice will fall into ruin. While there remains uncertainty about where these thresholds are, the best scientific evidence available today tells us that we have probably already crossed four of them. We are currently in overshoot and collapse . There are time lags in the system so the unraveling may not happen until the middle of this century. Instead of thinking about putting our child through college in 20 years, we must grapple with scenarios of tremendous upheaval and disruption. They will need to be a survivalist and servant to others in need. Notions of stable careers and long-term planning may never be a possibility in this child<U+2019>s life. I write these words not out of despair, but as an affirmation of the most rugged hopefulness I can muster. I was trained in climate science and I know what is coming. I have studied the rise and fall of empires so I am aware that fascist dictators and resource wars are likely to arise in the turmoil of the coming decades. Yet still I gently touch the swollen belly of my wife and feel our baby kicking and turning in her womb. I have felt the heartbeat of a new life and will do all I can to ensure that humanity makes it through to the other side. This is what it feels like to live through the death of capitalism. Eyes wide open even if tears may well up in them. I look to the horizon where shimmers of beautiful alternatives await. It doesn<U+2019>t have to be like this. We can do better. We must do better. In truth, there are already hundreds of millions of people actively struggling against the wealth extracting juggernaut that is Western development <U+2014> expressed as colonialism in early years, then later in the various forms of trade agreements, structural debt repayment programs, illicit resource wars fueled by propaganda, and the full apparatus of wealth extraction that is in place today. We needn<U+2019>t wonder why a mere 60 people have the same aggregate wealth as 4 billion. This is an outcome designed into the core logic of extraction that arises when private owners extract rents (what is commonly called profits) from the valuable labor of other people. It only took four hundred years for this system to run itself out. What no one could have predicted then was that the human population would explode and our fingerprints on the Earth would grow from tiny scratches here and there to deep scars that can be viewed from space. This is our legacy as a species right now. It is the bed we have prepared for our own children and grandchildren to lie down in. And it is our responsibility to carry through the dark times we are now in so that future generations can thrive in whatever ways make sense to them. I am with you, fellow humans. I believe in us. Let us not fall into despair or acquiesce as extremism rears its ugly head around the world <U+2014> as it did recently in the United States . For it will be the beacons of light we carry that will show others the way forward. For my part, I am working with social movements to connect the dots of wealth extraction and training change makers in the art and science of intentional social change. I have seen with my own eyes that millions of peasant farmers are organizing across Latin America and India; students are protesting outrageous debt in Mexico, Greece, and Spain; indigenous peoples are coming together across the North American continent to protect their sacred lands. We are gathering our strength for the collective transition. Of the 7.4 billion humans alive today, several hundred million are already organizing to drive the system to change. There is much to be hopeful about in this struggle. We each have a role to play. And time is of the essence. Onward, fellow humans. Want to support Joe Brewer's work?

The same flag was later maliciously burned and discovered this past Veteran<U+2019>s Day. \nThe burnt flag was then replaced by staff with a new flag, but later after <U+201C>consulting with constituents<U+201D> an official decision was made to remove not only the American flag, but all flags in order to have a conversation about what the American flag truly represents without simultaneously flying said flag, which was an apparent flag-trigger across an array of viewpoints in regard to flags. \nDuring the ongoing internet and communal static that has ensued thereafter, the President of Hampshire College, Jonathan Lash, has insisted that the school has been <U+201C><U+2026>Periodically flying the flag at half-staff to mourn deaths from violence around the world<U+2026><U+201D> \nThe statements made by President Lash and the official Facebook page of the campus both strongly imply that the flag was not lowered as a result of the election but rather as a way to generally mourn violence around the globe. \nSome outraged citizens are veterans and relatives of veterans, and some are not. Those currently opposed to the school<U+2019>s and student<U+2019>s behavior seem to have one thing in common- discontent for what they see as offensive acts and a disgrace to the democratic process and liberty that allows such a college to exist. \nA protest has been arranged for veterans and others to show their disapproval of the school<U+2019>s flag-lowering decision. The protest will take place this coming Sunday 11/27. \nChicopee veteran Delfo Barabani Jr., said in a message that <U+201C>The idea is to have as many people as possible carry an American Flag near the Hampshire campus.<U+201D> \nThe internet has been lively on the school<U+2019>s Facebook page which has been swarmed by thousands of commenters posting eagle and flag stickers: \nYou may remember mention of the school when NBC<U+2019>s SNL and then-skit-comedian Jimmy Fallon poked fun at how liberally-minded the campus was in a weekly skit that depicted Fallon as an ignorant stoner living in an on-campus dorm. It will be interesting to see how the mainstream network spins the character of this same demographic come protest-time Sunday now that their narrative encompasses support for the polar opposite. \nIt will certainly be telling to witness how cable news approaches such a divided issue during a time when public confidence in mainstream news networks has reached an all time low. This is of course due to distrust following WikiLeaks revelations that indicated many mainstream networks and broadcasters colluded with the Clinton campaign to both shut down Bernie Sanders in the primaries and win the presidential election [sic]. \n\nThe Hampshire College Facebook posts concerning this matter can be read in full below: \n@ November 21 at 3:59pm EST Hampshire College [fb]: A Statement from President Lash: <U+201C>Some months ago, the Hampshire College Board of Trustees adopted a policy of periodically flying the flag at half-staff to mourn deaths from violence around the world. Last week, in the current environment of escalating hate-based violence, we made the decision to fly Hampshire<U+2019>s U.S. flag at half-staff for a time while the community delved deeper into the meaning of the flag and its presence on our campus. This was meant as an expression of grief over the violent deaths being suffered in this country and globally, including the many U.S. service members who have lost their lives. Our intention was to create the space for meaningful and respectful dialogue across the many perspectives represented in our community. Unfortunately, our efforts to inclusively convey respect and sorrow have had the opposite effect. We have heard from many on our campus as well as from neighbors in the region that, by flying the flag at half-staff, we were actually causing hurt, distress, and insult. Our decision has been seen as disrespectful of the traditional expression of national mourning, and has been especially painful to our Hampshire campus colleagues who are veterans or families of veterans. Some have perceived the action of lowering the flag as a commentary on the results of the presidential election <U+2013> this, unequivocally, was not our intent. After some preliminary consultation with campus constituents (much more is needed), we decided on Friday that we will not fly the U.S. flag or any other flags on our college flagpole for the time being. We hope this will enable us in the near term to instead focus our efforts on addressing racist, misogynistic, Islamophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic, and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and behaviors. I ask our campus to join me in a commitment to living up to the ideals of our mission: to insist on diversity, inclusion, and equity from our leaders and in our communities; to constructively resist those who are opposing these values; and to actively and passionately work toward justice and positive change at Hampshire and in the world.<U+201D> \n\n@ 11/22/16 12:39pm EST [Note this post was edited by the Hampshire College page several times at the time this was published, this was the most recent version that the Facebook page posted] Hampshire College wrote on fb: Hampshire College respects all the feedback on our decision to remove the flag from our college flagpole for a period of time as our campus discusses what the flag represents to all members of our community. This decision is not and was never a commentary on the presidential election; our goal is to make this discussion a learning opportunity by giving voice to the range of viewpoints on campus across cultures, and hopefully find common ground. This is not a campus-wide ban as some media have mistakenly reported, campus members are free to individually display their own flags; this only pertains to our flagpole. As the College closes for Thanksgiving, our social media staff are on holiday break and are unable to respond to questions and to ensure posts adhere to community standards. As a result, we are suspending FB Comments through the Thanksgiving break. Emails may be sent to [email protected] Share:",

Central Italy was struck twice in quick succession the previous day, with the first tremor hitting it at around 19:11 local time (17:11 GMT). The quake measured 5.5 on the Richter scale and could be felt as far as Rome some 240 km (149 miles). Shortly after a second quake of 6.1-magnitude, struck at around 21:18 local time (19:18 GMT). Buildings were shaking, some parts even caving in, and residents fled into the street to save themselves. Several dozen people have been treated across the region for light injuries, while four are said to have been seriously hurt.

The discussion is not new, and the factors within the discussion, while changing somewhat with the times, tend to have remained the same. Stephen Kinzer<U+2019>s illustrative new history, The True Flag, takes the reader back to the turn of the Twentieth Century when the first acts of overseas empire were argued and acted on. \nIt can be argued that <U+2018>empire<U+2019> starts with the first movement across the continent by the new United States, incorporating, by various means, Florida, the Louisiana Purchase, the northern half of Mexican territory, and the lands of the native population. Kinzer acknowledges all that indirectly, as do some of the characters in the history, but his focus is on the pivotal years of 1898 to 1901 when the arguments concerning overseas territories focused on the Spanish empire in Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and the then sovereign state of Hawaii. \nThe writing is history at its best. Kinzer writes an interesting history with a casual anecdotal style of reading rather than the more common dry textbook style. While doing so the reader receives a sense of the actual personality and characteristics of each person within the narrative. As the story unwinds, these personality traits become as important as the actual facts of what happened, the latter having devolved form each individual<U+2019>s interests and intentions. \nThe title highlights Roosevelt and Mark Twain as the prime protagonist/antagonist pair. The history itself presents a significant group on either side: McKinley, Hearst, Lodge, and Roosevelt promoting empire; Hoar, Carnegie, Bryan, and Twain opposing the annexation/conquest of overseas territories. Many other characters come into play, but his group displays the personal characteristics that helped shape the overall argument. \nThe themes of the arguments are surprisingly familiar to contemporary empire critics. \nThe racist nature of U.S. endeavours runs throughout the discussion, ranging from the idea of <U+201C>benevolent assimilation<U+201D> allowing the <U+201C>blessings of good and stable government . . . under the free flag of the United States [McKinley],<U+201D> to <U+201C>the misguided Filipino [McKinley],<U+201D> but more strongly worded in the sanctimonious terms of <U+201C>savage tribes [Roosevelt]<U+201D> and from the military commander in the Philippines, a people <U+201C>in the childhood stage of race development.<U+201D> \nSound familiar to today<U+2019>s rhetoric? So do the underlying rationalizations and apologetics for empire. The Filipinos <U+201C>shall for ages hence bless the American republic,<U+201D> for their <U+201C>emancipation<U+201D> not just from another empire but from the <U+201C>arrogant rule of a native dictator.<U+201D> On the other hand, when the fighting became bloody and fierce, the insurrection fighters were attacked as <U+201C>They assailed our sovereignty [McKinley<U+2014>again],<U+201D> while the anti-imperialists at home became <U+201C>complicit in the killing of U.S. soldiers [Roosevelt].<U+201D> Rally <U+2018>round the flag boys. \nOther current themes run through the works. The ideas of the U.S. as a moral nation collided with the now consistent idea that <U+201C>it was foolish to dwell on constitutional niceties when vital interests were concerned.<U+201D> The concept of forceful morality came into play as it does today. Mckinley argued, Forcible intervention of the United States as a neutral to stop the war [would be] in the cause of humanity.<U+201D> The imperialists in general <U+201C>considered war purifying,<U+201D> and <U+201C>In their imagined future, humanity would be guided by a virtuous United States and disciplined by American military power.<U+201D> Sounds like something out of our contemporary Thomas Friedman and his <U+201C>hidden fist.<U+201D> \nThe reality underlying most of the rhetoric was markets, resources, and profits, much as it is today with the U.S. concern for maintaining its petrodollar hegemony. With the U.S. in an economic downturn, and millions unemployed (still familiar?) the imperialists argued that <U+201C>commerce would have to be protected, or imposed on unwilling nations by naval power . . . [fusing] America<U+2019>s commercial and strategic interests into a global strategy.<U+201D> Empire would create <U+201C>outlets for the surplus<U+201D> and guarantee America<U+2019>s <U+201C>commercial supremacy.<U+201D> Cuba was already mostly owned by fruit and sugar farmers, and the Philippines represented a market of 10 million citizens who would be educated to the U.S. manner of consumption and also would serve as a stepping stone into Asian markets. \nThe anti-empire people obviously lost the argument<U+2014>perhaps not the argument, but certainly the reality. Their central focus was the adverse effects overseas acquisitions would have on the very nature of the Republic that would eventually lead to its decline and its dislike and distrust by much of the world. In that sense, yes, they won the argument, but not the reality. \nSimilar to his other works, Stephen Kinzer presents an easily readable, entertaining, and informative history of these important years. The True Flag is an important addition to not only understanding this particular time of imperial expansion, but also as a basis for understanding most of the subsequent events leading up to today<U+2019>s aggrandizing imperial rhetoric<U+2014>it is not new. \nJim Miles is a Canadian educator and a regular contributor/columnist of opinion pieces and book reviews for The Palestine Chronicle. Miles<U+2019> work is also presented globally through other alternative websites and news publications. Reviews . Bookmark the permalink .",

Secretary of State Michele Reagan, four staffers and a freelance Spanish-language interpreter cast 138 votes on 40 ballots using seven touch-screen machines. The mood was jovial<U+2014>until a printout showed the numbers on one machine didn<U+2019>t line up with the master list of votes. Janine Petty, Arizona<U+2019>s deputy state election director, scanned the printout and quickly discovered another of Ms. Reagan<U+2019>s staffers had voted for two of the wrong candidates. The machine had worked perfectly, after all. Ms. Reagan jokingly admonished the sheepish staffer, telling him he should go on their fictional <U+201C>Wall of Shame.<U+201D> Across the country, state election officials are carrying out final tests on tens of thousands of voting machines that are part of a multistep process that delivers results in local, state and federal contests. Next week, the last of more than 120 million ballots are expected to be cast in a watershed election to determine who controls the White House, Congress and the direction of the Supreme Court. In a span of hours, the votes will be counted in places ranging from the Moose Lodge in Key West, Fla., to a fire hall in Kodiak, Alaska, relayed to state capitals and then broadcast around the world. The process was designed so the federal government didn<U+2019>t oversee it, but new fears about hackers from abroad have led to a scramble to see if the security protocols in place are sufficient. In Arizona, officials have been on edge for months. In July, a Russia-linked hacker posted online the stolen login credentials of a Gila County election official, spooking Ms. Reagan and others around the country. They know now that protecting the voting process means guarding against much different threats than they have confronted<U+00A0>in the past. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re not dealing with a couple of kids sitting in their bedroom,<U+201D> she said, sitting on an eight-seat plane on the way to Parker. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s cyberwarfare. These little state agencies are not the Pentagon. We don<U+2019>t have the resources.<U+201D> Hackers have scanned the election systems of at least 20 states, U.S. officials said, and now close to 40 states are working with the Department of Homeland Security to try to protect their election systems from digital tampering. As part of that effort, DHS is running a scan of the internet-linked state election systems to look for vulnerabilities, such as digital doors that hackers might be able to open. Through these reviews DHS officials learned that roughly 20 states had their election systems <U+201C>scanned<U+201D> by outside groups in a way that is akin to casing out a site for a future robbery, a DHS official said. DHS officials also discovered a broad range of computer security tools are used by states, and some needed to have their software updated or put in place new protections. They haven<U+2019>t yet found any <U+201C>catastrophic<U+201D> weaknesses, the DHS official said. Beyond cyber issues, there are other concerns. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has promoted unsubstantiated rumors of vote rigging and fraud, saying illegal immigrants have entered the U.S. from Mexico and will cast millions of votes. Arizona has dealt with voting challenges for decades. taking pride in its history as a hardscrabble libertarian frontier At one time, it loaded ballots onto mules for a 10-mile trek from a polling site at the base of the Grand Canyon to its rim. But in July, the state had to take the entire voter registration system offline to ensure that the hacker who had stolen the Gila County login credentials hadn<U+2019>t tampered with the information of 3.4 million voters. Russian officials have denied trying to interfere in the November elections, but the threat has awakened new fears. <U+201C>No one, not even the federal government, can protect themselves against the most sophisticated threat,<U+201D> said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, an election security expert and chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. <U+201C>What you see is people realizing that we have not been attuned to certain threats. Everyone is adopting armor.<U+201D> Even though Ms. Reagan and other state officials believe their voting machines cannot be hacked, they worry that antagonists could confuse the public by publishing false results on social media or temporarily knocking a state election site offline. Arizona is considered a reliably Republican state, but this year is different and that is raising the stakes for election officials. Polls suggest the presidential race here is tied. GOP Sen. John McCain has had to work to fight off a challenge from Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick. Longtime Maricopa County Sheriff Joseph Arpaio, a Republican, risks being ousted . And there are separate ballot measures that would legalize marijuana and raise the minimum wage to $12 by 2020. Voter enrollment numbers have soared. Here in La Paz County, voter enrollment has jumped to 9,000 this year from around 8,000 in 2014. Election director Kevin Scholl watches the state election testers with a forced smile, hoping they don<U+2019>t uncover any problems with his machines, which are more than 10 years old and will be replaced soon. When they aren<U+2019>t in use, the machines are sealed and locked down the hall, in a room that abuts a computer closet, which is also disconnected from the internet. Once voting is complete, memory cards are pulled out of the machines and loaded into that computer system in the secure room. The votes are tallied and then loaded onto a memory card, which is put into a different computer that sends the results securely to Ms. Reagan<U+2019>s team in Phoenix. Each of Arizona<U+2019>s 15 counties follows the same process. Ms. Reagan and her team wrapped up in Parker before 11 a.m., and then re-boarded their plane and flew 30 minutes to Yuma, a larger town near the Mexico border. She brought with her Ken Matta, a systems administrator who has been conducting tests since 2002. In Yuma, they were met by Robyn Stallworth Pouquette, the county recorder. Her office has received calls for weeks from people voicing concerns that the election will be <U+201C>rigged.<U+201D> The board of supervisors<U+2019> office in Yuma County is in an old bank, and the ballots are locked in a giant vault. Within minutes, Ms. Reagan and her team cast 2,906 votes on the machines there, looking for discrepancies. Standing with Ms. Pouquette was Paul Melcher, deputy county administrator, who is serving as interim head of elections. They ran through numerous contingency plans for Nov. 8. What do they do if there is a natural disaster? A terrorist attack? The power goes out? <U+201C>You try to plan for the unexpected,<U+201D> he said. At 12:02 p.m., Ms. Petty collected paperwork and the votes in Yuma lined up perfectly. <U+201C>Everything was beautiful,<U+201D> she told Ms. Pouquette and Mr. Melcher.

By Vic Bishop - October 28, 2016 \nWith the U.S. presidential elections just around the corner, concerns about violence on Election Day seem to be escalating. Several schools have announced that they will not hold classes when the polls are open due to fears of potential violence. According to a recent survey of voters, <U+201C>A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are <U+2018>very concerned.<U+2019><U+201D> \nVoters have been very obsessive in what<U+2019>s been an emotional presidential election year. It is possible that supporters of the winning party make a public display showing off their victory to emphasize the painful fact that the other candidate has lost. Will they become easy targets? Whoever has lost may question the validity of the election and accuse of opposing side of manipulating the results. If it comes to this, should we expect civil unrest? It may be smart to stock up on a few days of extra food and water , so you can just hole up at home if need be. \nMore details from the aforementioned survey can be found here . Election Year Has Been Filled With Political Hostilities \nIt<U+2019>s no surprise people are apprehensive about Election Day. Voters in the U.S. have been passionately divided when it comes to the candidates. Many are fervent to keep the worse of two evils out of office. Decisions seem to be driven more by animosity towards one candidate, rather than by inspiration or vision offered by the other. \nRegardless if the voter survey offers an accurate representation of how Americans truly feel, we cannot deny that political discord has already incited violence in communities across the States. A summary here offers just a glimpse at the various incidents that have occurred during the year. Take a look below at the reception a man wearing a Trump hat received when attending a Clinton rally. \nViolence isn<U+2019>t exclusive to Clinton supporters. Two videos below show how Trump supporters respond to unwelcome demonstration by their opposition. \nWith so much hatred and hostility surrounding the election, one can reasonably expect a violent, or at least unpleasant, conclusion. And any aggression will likely be exacerbated by the news media, which will make matters worse. Confidence In The Election Process Falters \nIn addition to the looming question of who will be named president, another big unknown is how will U.S. citizens react? Will they accept the results of the election ? As per the previous mentioned voter survey, it seems that the confidence Americans once had in their election process is definitely floundering. Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are <U+201C>very confident<U+201D> about that. More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won<U+2019>t recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn<U+2019>t have won fair and square. More than two-thirds of Trump voters say they worry the election returns could be manipulated. In contrast, eight in 10 of Clinton voters say the returns can be trusted to be fair and accurate. ( source ) Best Course is to Stay Prepared \nThe drama of the election year will likely continue after November 8. It is reasonable to expect that some communities will experience civil unrest, particularly where divisions are strong. It only makes sense to prepare, at least at the basic level, with a week<U+2019>s worth of storable food and water available in your home. It might also be smart to stock up your bug-out bag . Of course, some may feel the need to be a bit more aggressive with their preparedness plans: <U+201C>Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I<U+2019>ve been buying a lot more ammunition,<U+201D> says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan<U+2019>s Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to <U+201C>declare martial law and take our guns away<U+201D> after the election.

Russian Navy Fleet Starts Strikes at Terrorists' Positions in Syria's Aleppo Jaish Al-Fatah Leader Admits Receiving Financial, Military Aid from Saudi Arabia Why do we only hear of the <U+201C>humanitarian crisis in Aleppo<U+201D> and not everywhere else in Syria? Is Maintaining Assad the Least Worst Option? Army sources disclosed on Wednesday that pro-government troops are making final coordination for a massive offensive on Jeish al-Fatah terrorists in the Eastern parts of Aleppo city.\n\"As the army's 24-hour ultimatum to the terrorists to leave the city came to an end and as relative calm has prevailed over the Western and Southwestern parts of Aleppo, the army, the Lebanese Hezbollah fighters and special forces are getting ready to start attacking militants' defense line from several Eastern and Southern flanks,\" an army officer said.\nMeantime, he appreciated the Russian help, saying, \"The Russian air and naval back up will speed up the Syrian army's advances in the operation.\"\n\"Government forces are about to start their operation against the terrorists in Aleppo any moment,\" he added.\nLocal sources disclosed earlier on Wednesday that civilians in the Eastern districts of Aleppo city took to the streets to oppose Jeish al-Fatah's rule in the city, calling on the militants to leave Aleppo immediately.\n\"Unprecedented clashes between people and terrorists have pushed the Eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo city into a new wave of tensions,\" sources said, adding, \"People have taken part in demonstrations across the districts of Bostan al-Qasr and al-Kelaseh, calling on the terrorists to leave the city now.\"\n\"People have also attacked terrorists' food stuff warehouses, fighting with the militants for looting their food stuff from their neighborhoods,\" the sources added.\nThe sources went on to say that terrorists have arrested a number of demonstrators, hitting them badly.\nCivilians in militant-held districts of Aleppo are tired of terrorist groups' measures, including suppression of people and banning food and medicine for the families who prevent their young sons from joining the terrorist groups.\nMeantime, Tens of fighter jets launched airstrikes on terrorists' positions in Aleppo on Tuesday to herald the long-awaited ground operations to capture the Eastern parts of the city.\nTens of warplanes started massive air assaults on enemy targets in the Eastern parts of Aleppo on Tuesday after three weeks of lull and as Russia's Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier launched combat operations in Syria, the Arabic-language al-Mayadeen news channel reported.\nThe airstrikes started after several humanitarian pauses declared by the Syrian army and Russia to give a chance to the civilian population as well as the militants to leave the Eastern parts of the city through 8 corridors. Thousands of civilians left the city in the first few days, but militants blocked their exist paths, threatening to kill anyone who dares to approach the passages opened by the army. The terrorists aim to use the civilian population as a human shield.\nThe last such pause was declared on Monday when the army gave a 24-hour lone ultimatum to the Jeish al-Fatah coalition of terrorist groups to leave the flash point city. The deadline was not met by the militants, though.\nDefense experts believe that the blitzkrieg is the first part of the long-awaited army operations in Eastern Aleppo to take back the entire city. Aleppo is halved into the government-ruled West and militant-held East. The militants rejected a guaranteed exit to relocate to Idlib or other militant-ruled territories in the hope that over 30,000 fresh forces would penetrate the city through the Southwestern front to lift the army's several-month-long siege on Eastern Aleppo.\nJeish al-Fatah lost thousands of militants in over two weeks of bloody war in Southern and Southwestern Aleppo, but failed to open a corridor for entrapped friends in the East.\nThe massive airstrikes in Aleppo come as Russia's Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft-carrying cruiser began combat operations in Syria.\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced earlier that Russian frigate Admiral Grigorovich launched missiles on terrorist targets in Syria.\n\"Today, we started a major operation to launch massive strikes on ISIL and al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front) targets in the Idlib and Homs provinces in Syria,\" Shoigu said at a meeting with the ministry<U+2019>s leadership and defense enterprises.\n\"For the first time in history of Russian Navy, Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft-carrying cruiser has begun military operations,\" Shoigu said.\nRussian naval task force in Syria is reliably protected by Bastion Coastal Defense Missile Systems and Pantsir systems, the minister said.\nAlso, General Command of the Syrian Army announced earlier that the country's soldiers and popular forced are about to hit Jeish al-Fatah's positions in the Eastern districts of Aleppo from nine different flanks.\n\"Our forces, including very well trained units, are deployed in nine different fronts and are waiting for the specified deadline,\" the command center said in a statement.\nOther informed sources disclosed that the Syrian army has prepared a large number of forces, who are expert in street battle and are equipped with lethal weapons, ready to start final the battle with the terrorist groups.\nThe sources also added that these forces will be backed up by the missile and air support of the Syrian and Russian force",

Amnesty says the US must come clean about the civilian toll of its fight against Islamic State.\nAmnesty suspects that US Central Command (CENTCOM), which directs coalition airstrikes in Syria, <U+00E2><U+20AC><U+0153>may have<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+015A> carried out unlawful attacks<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+009D> in Syria , failing to take necessary measures to prevent civilian killings.\n<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+0153>We fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria,<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+009D> said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty International<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+2122>s Beirut regional office.\n<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+0153>It<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+2122>s high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria. Independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public.<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+009D>\nAmnesty investigated evidence, including eyewitness accounts, reports by human rights organizations and the media, photographs and video footage as well as satellite imagery, related to 11 suspected coalition attacks in Syria. The group estimates that the attacks have claimed as many as 300 civilian lives. So far none of these deaths has been acknowledged by CENTCOM.\nThe report published on Wednesday added that the total civilian death toll from coalition action <U+00E2><U+20AC><U+0153>could be as high as 600 or more than 1,000<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+009D> since the operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) started in Syria in 2014.\nOne of the strikes investigated by Amnesty took place in the early hours of December 7, 2015. The attacks hit two houses in the village of Ayn al-Khan, near al-Hawl in al-Hasakah governorate in northern Syria, killing 40 civilians, including 19 children, and injuring at least 30 others, the report said.\nAccording to an eyewitness account, an initial night strike was followed by a second attack from a helicopter gunship, which hit first responders trying to dig out survivors.\n<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+0153>At this point I had a two-month-old baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop him<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+015A> I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved me<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+015A> My mother, aunt, wife and children <U+00E2><U+20AC><U+201C> a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who I<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+2122>d rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed,<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+009D> the survivor said.\nThe strike is believed to have targeted IS fighters. But local Kurdish militia reportedly warned the coalition that there were civilians in the area.\nAmnesty said CENTCOM<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+2122>s failure to acknowledge civilian deaths in Syria, as well as the poor record of investigating such incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq, poses grave concerns over the toll which the civilian population of Mosul, Iraq is likely to face from the ongoing operation to take the city from IS. The US-led coalition is providing air support for the offensive.\n<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+0153>Given the likely increase in air strikes by the US-led Coalition as part of the Iraqi offensive to recapture Mosul, it is even more pressing that CENTCOM be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians. And it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure,<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+009D> said Maalouf.\nA similar operation to capture Manbij, Syria, which is far smaller than Mosul, killed more than 200 civilians, Amnesty estimated.\nMeanwhile, US State Department spokesman John Kirby said that the US <U+00E2><U+20AC><U+0153>takes seriously all credible allegations of civilian casualties.<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+009D>\n<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+0153>Pentagon has a fairly comprehensive system for analyzing themselves what these allegations are and then, when they feel that they want further investigation, they do it. And unlike any other military in the world, they actually release the results of these investigations. And unlike any other military in the world, if the hold people accountable for their actions they [bring them to justice] too,<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+009D> Kirby said during the press briefing on Wednesday.\nAt the same time, he said that the Department of State is not aware of the Amnesty<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+2122>s report about the US Central Command (CENTCOM) strikes in Syria and suggested contacting the Pentagon for that matter. He also welcomed the Amnesty<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+2122>s <U+00E2><U+20AC><U+0153>input<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+009D> and stressed that <U+00E2><U+20AC><U+0153>no military tries harder than the US military to limit, to prevent casualties to civilians or damage to civilian infrastructure.<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+009D>\n<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+0153>We are not at all afraid to receive criticism about our efforts,<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+009D> Kirby added.\nThe 300 fatalities are those that Amnesty considers credible, but the number is likely around 900, the report<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+2122>s author, Neil Sammonds, told RT. He said that while there were some indications that the Pentagon would try to improve the targeting of its strikes in Syria, so far this hasn<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+2122>t happened.\n<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+0153>Until now the big picture in Syria is that they are not investigating thoroughly enough, they are not aware as they should be of the amount of civilians they have killed, and it means that it is quite possible that they will be killing more civilians in their campaign to retake Mosul from Islamic State.<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+009D>\nHe added that Amnesty was focusing on other parties in the Syrian conflict, including the Syrian government, Russia, terrorist groups and armed rebels, who, he said, are responsible for more civilian deaths than the US-led coalition, which explains why the report didn<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+2122>t come sooner.\nLast week, Amnesty International blasted Russia for civilian deaths in Aleppo. The Syrian city is divided between government forces and various armed groups, including the Al-Qaeda offshoot Al-Nusra Front. Russia says that the militants use civilians as human shields and would not allow them to leave the city, derailing several attempts by Russia to open humanitarian corridors out of the city.\nSource \n",

She is a Republican who has an extensive experience as a lawyer. Her experience qualifies her for Congress as she has years of building multitasking skills.\nEven though Perry is a GOP candidate, she is moderate in her thinking. She will represent all residents of her district and Nevada. Putting the citizen<U+2019>s needs and desires first is her priority.\nIntroducing Mary Perry Perry is a strong woman with a sense of humility needed for success in Washington D.C. As a Congresswoman, she will work both sides of the aisle to secure the needs of Nevadans.\nShe understands people who are underprivileged; her background includes growing up in a low-income family in Arkansas. When she was 14, Perry and her family moved to Galveston, Texas.\nPerry spent over eight years in the Air Force as a computer operator for 5 years then began working in training management. She embraced the opportunity to serve America. Perry was discharged in 1993 and chose to make Las Vegas her home.\nIn 1996, Perry secured a Bachelor of Science degree in business management from the University of Las Vegas. Two years later she began studying at the William S. Boyd School of Law. In 2001 she graduated and passed the Nevada State Bar exam. Perry has also passed the bar in Missouri and Hawaii.\nSince 2003, Perry practiced family law. Her caring for people is evident and can be seen by the pro bono legal service she has provided. In fact, Perry has dedicated as much as 50 percent of her time serving those who could not otherwise afford an attorney.\nMary Perry on the Issues While in Washington D.C., Perry will strive to work for Nevada<U+2019>s concerns. She intends to work hard toward solutions, not create new problems.\nHer stand on the issues are as follows:\nAffordable Care Act: Unlike many politicians, she does not believe that repealing the ACA would be effective unless there is a program in place to take its place. The choices are repeal or repair. Perry has a four-part plan to improve what she calls a monstrosity of legislation to make it affordable, sustainable, and provide quality healthcare. Education: This is a huge issue for Nevada. The failing schools have proved that the Department of Education is not effective as a governing body. It is vital to rid the educational system of big government and return the power to local entities. Each state would then be empowered to tailor their program to fit the needs of their student body. Energy: Dependence on foreign oil must end. There are many ways to achieve this. We could completely end our dependency on oil by using compressed natural gas to run automobiles, heat our homes, etc.\n1 <U+2013> Return federal lands to the western U.S. The feds own approximately 84 percent of the land in Nevada. There is the potential of using the wind and sun as alternative energy.\n2 <U+2013> Allow the Keystone XL pipeline construction to proceed.\n3 <U+2013> Oppose all proposals to impose the environmental program referred to as cap-and-trade. Should this program be implemented, it would significantly raise household bills for energy. Additionally, it would be controlled by the federal government.\n4 <U+2013> End the <U+201C>green energy<U+201D> programs run by the federal government.\n5 <U+2013> <U+201C>Loosen federal regulations that place heavy burdens on the exploration, drilling, and transportation of oil and natural gas.<U+201D> Immigration Reform: The fact that there are individuals who do not have the right to be in the U.S. legally.\n1 <U+2013> Secure the border for many reasons; preventing illegal immigration, stop the flow of illegal weapons and drugs. Furthermore, the secure border would prevent possible terrorists from entering the country.\n2 <U+2013> Require employers to use the tool in place for determining the eligibility of employees to work in the U.S.; E-Verify.\n3 <U+2013> Support H.R.2131 -SKILLS Visa Act, which will encourage raising the number of immigrants with specialized skills in America. The bill is designed for the creation of worldwide employment-based immigration levels. Jobs and Economy: Eliminating red tape and keeping taxes at a minimum will promote job creation.\n1 <U+2013> Create a more efficient government by implementing a business like budgeting system.\n2 <U+2013> The tax system needs repairing. Perry explained, <U+201C>It should not take an accountant and an attorney to understand it.<U+201D>\n3 <U+2013> Tariffs need to be set encouraging companies to stay in America. If it is not more profitable for a business to operate off-shore, then there would be an increase of jobs in the U.S.\n4 <U+2013> <U+201C>Repeal laws and regulations that negatively impact free enterprise.<U+201D> Medicare and Social Security: Seniors have earned these benefits. Perry will fight to protect the programs. She will also be prepared to do what it takes to strengthen both social security and medicare. Second Amendment: The right to bear arms is a constitutional, fundamental, and individual right, as written in the Bill of Rights. It is vital to oppose any effort to restrict gun rights. Taxes: Higher taxes are bad for the economy. On Perry<U+2019>s website, she lists her proposals for tax legislation. These include; voting against all net tax increases, support a simpler tax system, eliminate the federal death tax, lower corporate tax rate, and oppose increases in dividend and capital gains taxes. Veterans: As a vet, Perry is passionate about those who served the U.S. She has outlined a solid plan for veteran<U+2019>s rights. The Congressional district Perry seeks to represent would benefit from a moderate politician. She served the U.S. during her years in the Air Force The training and discipline from the military, the years in college, and the time spent a lawyer have created powerful yet reasonable characteristics that Perry will use in Washington, D.C.\nBy Cathy Milne\nSources:\nWebsite: Friends of Mary Perry for Congress District One\nFacebook: Mary Perry\nNoticiero Movil:  Moderate Underdog in a Blue District: Getting to Know Mary Perry\nBallotpedia: Mary Perry\n\nImages Courtesy of Mary Perry <U+2013> Used With Permission",

The Wall Street Journal is hosting WSJDLive, an annual event that brings together tech leaders and luminaries. Click here for the latest news and join the conversation at #wsjdlive. The social network is building new tools to make videos more compelling, including new filters that will make live videos look more painterly, said Chris Cox, Facebook<U+2019>s chief product officer, at the WSJDLive conference in Laguna Beach, Calif. Those filters reinterpret a live video in the style of painters like Monet or Rembrandt. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re making the camera a really nice creative tool and that<U+2019>s the kind of thing we<U+2019>re very invested in right now,<U+201D> Mr. Cox said during a panel with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook<U+2019>s chief operating officer, on Tuesday. It is unclear when those filters, which are still in the prototype phase, will be available to all users. Video will be 70% of all traffic to sites like Facebook<U+2019>s mobile traffic by 2021, Mr. Cox added. Mr. Cox and Ms. Sandberg<U+2014>two of the longest tenured executives at the 12-year-old social media company<U+2014>also reiterated that Facebook is a technology company focused on building tools, not a media company focused on making stories. Facebook has become a key source of expression as well as information for its 1.7 billion monthly users. Prompts from the company have encouraged more than two million users to register to vote, Ms. Sandberg said. But as it has grown, Facebook has found itself grappling with the some of the very issues faced by news organizations for decades. That tension has been highlighted over the last year by several controversial content decisions made by Facebook. In September, the company drew rebuke when its reviewers deleted posts containing a famous Vietnam War photo of a girl fleeing napalm bombs. Facebook later reversed the decision after intense criticism from Norway<U+2019>s prime minister and the nation<U+2019>s largest newspaper, saying it would allow the image due to its <U+201C>history and global importance.<U+201D> Last December, top Facebook executives agreed to preserve some of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump <U+2019>s posts, even though two posts calling for a ban on Muslims from entering the U.S. violated the site<U+2019>s rules for hate speech, The Wall Street Journal reported last week . Ms. Sandberg said Facebook has twin goals: to be a platform for all ideas and to create a safe community. <U+201C>Those two things can come into conflict because one person<U+2019>s free expression can be another person<U+2019>s hate,<U+201D> Ms. Sandberg said. <U+201C>You can see with lots of these decisions<U+2014>we<U+2019>re balancing these things.<U+201D> Last week, Facebook said it would relax its strict rules around what users can post to allow more newsworthy content, even if it pushes the limits of what the site allows. Facebook has had rules in place for years banning discrimination toward people based on their race and religion. <U+201C>I think the really big question is how do we make sure that people have free expression on Facebook,<U+201D> said Ms. Sandberg. She added that the company is evolving as a service and trying to <U+201C>really figure<U+201D> out where to draw the line on content. Facebook said it would seek input from publishers, journalists, photographers, law-enforcement officials and safety advocates as it allows more newsworthy content. The site doesn<U+2019>t want to give users a platform to commit violence, Ms. Sandberg said, pointing out that Facebook cooperates with law enforcement. Facebook typically removes content that violates the rules. Live video, an area in which Facebook is investing heavily, is a new challenge to its standards. Facebook Live, which launched globally in April, allows users to broadcast their lives with a tap of a button. To ensure a steady flow of live videos after launch, Facebook agreed to pay millions of dollars to at least 140 major publishers, celebrities, athletes and public figures to produce live broadcasts. Now, Facebook is looking to drum up enthusiasm for live video among ordinary people. The filters showcased Tuesday allow users to capture live video that they can proud of, Mr. Cox said.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Eliza Shapiro \n source: http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/11/moskowitz-will-not-serve-as-trumps-education-secretary-107436 \n text: Eva Moskowitz, CEO of Success Charter Network. | Dario Cantatore/Getty Images for Tribeca Film Festival By Eliza Shapiro 11/17/16 11:41 AM EST Eva Moskowitz will not serve as education secretary under President-elect Donald Trump's administration, the charter school leader announced on Thursday. \"At this time, I will not be entertaining any prospective opportunities,\" Moskowitz told reporters at an unrelated news conference outside City Hall. Story Continued Below Moskowitz, CEO of Success Academy, the city's largest charter network, said she had voted for Hillary Clinton, but hopes to work with Trump on the issue of school choice, saying there were \"many positive signs\" that the president-elect would govern differently than he campaigned. \"I will work with him and whoever he selects as education secretary,\" she said, adding that she is \"troubled by what I see as a sort of rooting for Trump's failure.\" Moskowitz had been under consideration for the Cabinet position, according to Trump officials, and she met with Trump at his office in Trump Tower on Wednesday, POLITICO New York reported. She previously declined to comment on the possibility of serving under Trump. Moskowitz's meeting with Trump came as something of a surprise to New York City's education community, given her long history as a Democrat and the overwhelmingly minority population of her 41 charter schools. The morning after Trump's surprise victory last week, Moskowitz wrote a letter to her staff, telling them she was personally \"upset\" by the outcome. She also predicted: <U+201C>Many of our families today will feel very deeply and very directly that they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump<U+2019>s campaign.<U+201D> Other education reform leaders, including former D.C. schools Chief Michelle Rhee and Center for Education Reform director Jeanne Allen, are reportedly still in the running for the post. Moskowitz<U+2019>s brief flirtation with a Trump appointment could provide enduring fodder for her critics. United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew has already begun that line of attack: on Wednesday, he criticized Moskowitz for entertaining the possibility. The speculation could also put Moskowitz in an awkward spot with Success Academy parents. Of the 14,000 children in her 41 charters, 93 percent are black or Latino. Many are Muslim, and some are undocumented immigrants <U+2014> all groups that came out disproportionately against Trump last Tuesday. Moskowitz repeatedly declined on Thursday to answer questions about whether she was concerned that any undocumented students in her schools might be deported under Trump's administration. Moskowitz has grown her national stature in recent years, criss-crossing the country to promote Success Academy specifically, and education reform in general, in the halls of Congress and at the annual closed-door meeting of the country's most influential financiers and CEOs at the Sun Valley Conference. But even charter school allies expressed concern about what a possible Moskowitz appointment would mean for the national education reform movement. New York Magazine columnist Jonathan Chait, a strong supporter of charters, warned on Wednesday that Moskowitz's appointment could spell \"disaster for the cause of education reform\" by tying the movement to Trump's administration. Moskowitz maintains close ties to hedge-fund billionaire John Paulson, who has been a major donor to both Trump and Success Academy. Thursday<U+2019>s news conference was the second time in a year that Moskowitz took to the steps of City Hall to end speculation about her future ambitions. Last fall, she convened a news conference to announce that she would not challenge Mayor Bill de Blasio's reelection in 2017, though associates of Moskowitz maintain that she still hopes to one day become mayor. Moskowitz will now remain at the helm of the Success network, which she plans to grow to 100 schools over the next decade. That aggressive expansion plan has been complicated over the last year, as she's battled negative stories about the internal workings of her network and about controversial discipline practices in Success schools. In her remarks on Thursday, Moskowitz singled out The New York Times <U+2014> which has reportedly critically on Success Academy <U+2014> for their coverage of Trump's transition. \"When the Times takes near-daily pot-shots at President-elect Trump's transition team, they are using up ink that should be spent on the challenges our country faces,\" she said. Moskowitz, who was at City Hall to press for more school space for charter students, said she plans to continue her ongoing battle with the mayor. \"If I left and went to D.C., who would keep their eyes on Mayor de Blasio?\" she said on Thursday.

They made up 45% of the state<U+2019>s electorate in 2012, exit polls showed, and 43%<U+00A0>on Tuesday. But they helped deliver the state for Republican Donald Trump that Mitt Romney lost four years ago. That was because Mr. Trump boosted his party<U+2019>s margins among white voters, particularly working-class whites. Mr. Trump won white voters in Ohio without a four-year college degree by 27 percentage points, taking 62% of their votes. Mr. Romney won this group in 2012, but by 14 points. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s success offers evidence to support a view long controversial among Republicans<U+2014>that the party can win by pumping up turnout among its largely white base, rather than adopting policies on immigration or other matters that might draw in more minority voters. The share of white voters continued its long-term fall, dropping from 72% of all voters in 2012 to 70% this year. Exit-poll results show how Mr. Trump was able to pump up his totals among this shrinking group. In Florida, for instance, whites made up 62% of the electorate, down from 67% in 2012. But while Mr. Romney won 61% of their votes in 2012, Mr. Trump took 64%. That was enough to flip the state into his column. Similar shifts took place across the upper Midwest<U+2014>in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio<U+2014>as well as in Pennsylvania. Michigan remains too close to call, but Mr. Trump moved the other states into the GOP column. Hillary Clinton was able to make up for some of those losses with better performance than Barack Obama among college-educated white voters. But she was toppled by the working-class vote. <U+201C>What completely broke the machine was these massive shifts among white, noncollege voters,<U+201C> said Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Democratic-leaning Center for American Progress, who has studied this voting bloc. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s the real story.<U+201D> For some, it is a validation of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign message, which focused heavily on the idea that illegal immigration and free-trade deals had sapped jobs that should belong to struggling Americans. Others worry that eventually there won<U+2019>t be enough working-class white voters to deliver this sort of victory. <U+201C>At some point that strategy is going to catch up with us,<U+201D> said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who advocates a broader appeal. <U+201C>He managed to slip by one more election without it, but there is no doubt<U+2026>that the proportion of whites in the national electorate is still declining and will continue to do so.<U+201D> Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com",

People are trading the narrative that America will be great again, so the U.S. dollar is very strong and gold has weakened as a consequence. There is a sense that between the Chinese Silk Road and the planned infrastructure spending by Trump that this will drive demand for industrial commodities and at the same time this will strengthen the world economy. I think those premises are wrong. \nA Look At 2017 I think 2017 will see one of those unique situations where the dollar moves up as a consequence of the relative strength of the U.S. economy, but I also believe that gold will move higher as well as a consequence of negative real interest rates on a global basis and increasing realization among investors that the debt and deficits of various governments are not sustainable. \nWith regards to the industrial metals, I don<U+2019>t think the demand creation will be there, but I think prices will move higher as a result of supply destruction. This will be a messier phenomenon but one that will generate larger price increases. \nAssuming that people took profits as I advocated in the summer on King World News, I think we will be looking at the same type of reload opportunity that we saw in late 1975 and late 2001 and early 2002. No bull market goes straight up. There are retrenchments that are normal and healthy and right now we are seeing exactly that. \nHere Is What Sprott Asset Management Is Doing The gold and silver mining shares have been hammered and that has created enormous opportunity for investors. We are carefully deploying capital at Sprott Asset Management into private placements with high-quality companies that we believe will experience significant upside moves as the market correction comes to an end. \nLooking at the start of 2017, the elites clearly do not like Trump, and this should create a lot of noise as he moves to push his agenda through Congress. That noise should be extremely positive for the gold market. So while it is possible that gold might remain weak at the start of the year, at some point we will see some real fireworks to the upside in 2017.<U+201D> \n*** KWN has released one of legendary Art Cashin<U+2019>s greatest audio interviews ever discussing the gold market at length, including the recent takedown in gold, what to surprises to expect in key markets as Trump becomes president, and what impact massive public works projects will have on the United States, inflation, gold, bonds, and much more. and you can listen to this extraordinary interview by CLICKING HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. \n***KWN has also released the extraordinary KWN audio interview with whistleblower Andrew Maguire, where he discusses the gold and silver smash, at what price the large sovereign wholesale bids are located, and much more, and you can listen to it by CLICKING HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. \n  Former Soros Associate Just Warned The Pros Have Have It Wrong, Gold & Silver Will Skyrocket Like The 1970s CLCK",

Nevertheless, as a proud young American, I have complete faith in our nation<U+2019>s ability to move forward <U+2014> regardless of the bleak outcome on Tuesday. I implore Donald Trump to restore a sense of unity to our polarized and vitriolic political and social realms. I implore Mr. Trump to act in a way that fosters pride in the political system of our country, especially for the sake of my generation. And, lastly, I implore Mr. Trump to keep the promise that he made to the American public at the G.O.P. convention in July to be a compassionate head of state for all citizens. Godspeed! MATT OSUBOR New York To the Editor: In 2008, as I drove home from the friend<U+2019>s house where I had watched the election results, tears streamed down my face because we had elected an African-American president. On Tuesday night, after I got home from my son<U+2019>s house, where I had watched the election results, I sobbed <U+2014> not in pride but in despair. CAROLINE ACKER Berkeley, Calif. To the Editor: Donald Trump won because average, middle-class Americans voted against the corrupt Washington political establishment, not because they like Mr. Trump. His victory can best be described as a revolt against professional politicians, lobbyists, big business/Wall Street, big government and corruption. My hope is that Mr. Trump drains the political swamp in Washington, and that he keeps his word to make America great again for everyone! DANIEL ROBINOWITZ Dallas To the Editor: The unthinkable has happened. Aside from Sept. 11, 2001, this is the saddest day for America and the world in my lifetime. I write this from Colombia, visiting with friends and watching the disaster unfold. I cannot wrap my head around the fact that we have elected a sexual predator, tax evader, liar, bigot, xenophobe and hater to the most important office in the world. I was aghast when George W. Bush won two terms, but I would be thrilled to have Bush 43 back in the White House today. Undocumented immigrants will need to start hiding out. Investors need to brace for a major downturn in the markets, and our allies in NATO need to reconsider their alliances. A staunch conservative will be named to the Supreme Court, no gun safety laws will be enacted, and we can forget about taking on the catastrophe of climate change. Everything I have believed in and about this great nation is about to come tumbling down, and I wonder how long it will take <U+2014> if ever <U+2014> to recover from the blunder of electing Donald Trump. HENRY A. LOWENSTEIN Cartagena, Colombia To the Editor: I am a liberal Democrat who, not being able to stomach either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, voted for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. I hope the Democratic Party does some serious reflection on why its candidate lost. It bears some part in all of this <U+2014> for anointing a candidate like Hillary with so much baggage, for neglecting blue-collar workers across the Rust Belt states, for failing to see the extent to which Hillary<U+2019>s email server and Clinton Foundation controversies turned off many voters, including Democrats like me. I hope that The New York Times also does some reflection on how it got things so wrong this past year. SARITHA PRABHU Clarksville, Tenn. To the Editor: I could not bring myself to vote for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, but Mr. Trump could turn out to be a better president than the press thinks. While he often seemed uniformed and erratic during the campaign, he is intelligent and well spoken when he wants to be, and he thinks big. Nor is he a lock-step partisan. He has tendencies both left and right, and if the gravity of his new office tempers his worst impulses and he surrounds himself with good people, he has the capacity to be a strong leader who gets things done. Most of all, I am thrilled that Mr. Trump beat the mainstream press, which dropped all pretense of neutrality this year in order to save us from a monster. Along with other elites in both parties, you are glum today. It<U+2019>s delicious. MARK R. GODBURN North Canaan, Conn. To the Editor: All of us who are patriotic Americans, however we felt before Election Day, must now support President-elect Donald Trump. This is our patriotic duty. All Americans must deal with the results of this election with maturity and with respect for the will of the majority of our country. It is our historical responsibility, no matter whom we supported, to respect the democratic process. Above all we must find common ground and then work out our differences in a civilized manner. The entire world is watching the United States very closely at this moment. America must come together and lead the world through these perilous times. WILLIAM E. BAUMZWEIGER Studio City, Calif. To the Editor: It is 6:29 in the morning after Election Day. At first, I was angry at the results <U+2014> angry at an America that has become so twisted to support a man with racist, sexist and bigoted ideas. Then I was sad and worried <U+2014> genuinely fearful for my own and others<U+2019> lives. I<U+2019>m afraid for every minority out there. I<U+2019>m afraid for women everywhere, who are seeing that a man who has said and done such nasty things to women has now been elected president of the United States. To everyone who is upset at the results of the election, keep fighting. Now, more than ever, we need to fight for our rights. We will not sit down. We will not be silenced. We will keep working toward progress. STEPHANIE WANG McMurray, Pa. The writer is a high school senior.

The Dallas telecom giant, which agreed to buy Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion last month, began the practice known as <U+201C>zero rating<U+201D> with its own DirecTV<U+2019>s video app in September. AT&T has said it plans to do the same for its over-the-top service DirecTV Now when it launches later this month. AT&T<U+2019>s practice <U+201C>may obstruct competition and harm consumers by constraining their ability to access existing and future mobile video services not affiliated with AT&T,<U+201D> Jon Wilkins, the head of the FCC<U+2019>s wireless division, wrote in a letter to Robert Quinn, AT&T<U+2019>s head of external and legislative affairs. In a statement responding to the letter, Mr. Quinn argued that consumers benefit from the program because it lets others pay for data use. <U+201C>We welcome any video provider that wishes to sponsor its content in the same <U+2018>data free<U+2019> way,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ll do so on equal terms at our lowest wholesale rates.<U+201D> AT&T has said zero rating promotes competition and that it offers any company that wants to be zero-rated the same payment terms available to its DirecTV subsidiary. But the FCC in its letter argued that the in-house payments made by DirecTV don<U+2019>t require any net outlays by the parent company, and so can<U+2019>t be compared with AT&T<U+2019>s rivals paying for the same privilege. The agency, which sent the letter the day after Donald Trump won the presidential election, cited its net neutrality rules, passed last year, in justifying its concerns and asked AT&T to respond by Nov. 21. It highlighted that the letter specifically applies to AT&T<U+2019>s practices and not to all zero rating, which it assesses on a case-by-case basis. <U+201C>These are incredibly popular services that we hope regulators won<U+2019>t take away from the millions of people who enjoy them today,<U+201D> AT&T<U+2019>s Mr. Quinn said. <U+201C>It makes it easier for consumers to say goodbye to their cable company.<U+201D> But the FCC said AT&T<U+2019>s policy of charging itself doesn<U+2019>t take into account the <U+201C>notably different financial impact on unaffiliated providers<U+201D> because there is no cash cost for AT&T to zero-rate its own services. The agency also noted that the data usage levels could lead to significant costs for a third-party video provider. Those charges could <U+201C>render infeasible any third-party competitor<U+2019>s attempt to compete with the $35 per month retail price that AT&T has announced for DirecTV Now.<U+201D> The FCC noted that potential subscribers to another service would have to take into account the cost of that service, plus data costs. <U+201C>Unaffiliated video content providers appear to confront significant disadvantages,<U+201D> the letter stated. Streaming services like Netflix and Hulu have been growing in popularity in recent years as consumers cut the cord on cable and watch more video on their mobile phones. Those rival streaming services and media companies are likely to ask regulators to scrutinize zero rating as part of a review of AT&T<U+2019>s takeover of Time Warner, people familiar with the matter have said. AT&T began allowing companies to pay for zero rating in 2014, but so far no major streaming providers have done so. Verizon Communications Inc. doesn<U+2019>t charge its customers for data for its National Football League games or its go90 mobile video app. T-Mobile US Inc. <U+2019>s <U+201C>Binge On<U+201D> program allows any video provider to be exempt from data caps without paying the carrier, although the video is delivered at lower quality. It also allows customers and content companies to opt out. <U+2014>Shalini Ramachandran and Ryan Knutson contributed to this article. Write to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Robert Fisk \n source: informationclearinghouse.info \n text: The Tales of Bodies and Blood That Surround a Front Line in Syria By Robert Fisk\n The Independent \" - We arrived so soon after Jabhat al-Nusra<U+0092>s retreat from the village that one man and his family had only just buried the remains of four Islamists at the bottom of their field. <U+0093>We found them at the back and they stank so much that we had to get rid of them,<U+0094> Mohamed Kenjo said. <U+0093>So we took the remains and put them under a covering of earth away from our home.<U+0094>\nBut the house he once shared with his wife and six children had been looted <U+0096> everything, from the washing machine and the water tank, to cups and saucers and kettles <U+0096> and the homes of Kenjo<U+0092>s neighours lay in ruins, broken open by shells and rockets. This was the front line north of Hama, a city whose history lay in the blood of insurrection more than 34 years ago.\nSo close to the front line, in fact, that the fighter bombers were still howling over our heads to attack the Islamists <U+0096> Ahrar al-Sham, Nusra, all the usual suspects <U+0096> in the next village to the north-west. The Syrians say you can only see their jets, that the Russian fighter-bombers are so fast it<U+0092>s impossible to catch them with the naked eye. You could make out the spray of anti-missile flares that the aircraft released, four or five bright stars that drifted through the imperial blue sky like fireworks.\nBut then, as the planes turned one after the other from their bombing runs, you could just see them as the sun caught their swept-back wings, daggering up into the heavens to the south before their bombs exploded with a loud, hollow sound like two giant wooden planks banging together on the ground. Amid the soldiers, sweating, tired, a general turned up, steel helmet over his eyes, marching briskly with his officers through the ruins. I wanted to know how many of the Nusra men had died.\n<U+0093>Many, many,<U+0094> he replied. But when I asked how many of his Syrian soldiers had been killed in the broken, smashed village of Soran, his answer came without hesitation. <U+0093>We had 42 martyrs,<U+0092> he said bleakly. I didn<U+0092>t doubt the figure. And when soldiers tell the truth, it means they are winning. But that<U+0092>s a lot of men to lose for one dust-covered hamlet. The Syrian army<U+0092>s death toll in six years of war is a state secret. But I<U+0092>ve been given a reliable figure for the government army<U+0092>s fatalities in this terrible war: around 75,000. These are the dead, not the hundreds of thousands of wounded. Soldiers expect to die. They live by the sword.\nCivilians on both sides are the innocents whose lives should be spared. Their mortality statistics come from all sides, including the United Nations. Is it 250,000 or 300,000 as the UN now states? Or 400,000 as the <U+0093>experts<U+0094> in faraway cities now claim? Whatever the figure, add another 75,000 to it.\nThe ruins of the village of Soran north of Hama (Nelofer Pazira)\nThe Nusra men and their allies had only captured this place two and a half months ago. House after house in what had been Soran had been blown apart. Some remained, their doors ajar, the bougainvillea still spilling over their concrete walls. But always, when I walked inside, there were cupboards torn open by the retreating Islamists, piles of children<U+0092>s clothes and toys and clocks and family snapshots scattered across the floor. One picture showed a baby smiling from a cot, another a husband and wife surrounded by their children. The Islamists had probably been looking for money hidden in the cupboards. But why did the looters want a washing machine? Did they plan to lug this rubbish away in their retreat? What happened to those who lived here?\nThere was no doubt of the tragedy of one middle-aged man. He stood forlornly in the street beside a huge bomb crater surrounded by heavy, jagged pieces of steel casing that lay at his feet. <U+0093>I am a policeman in Hama,<U+0094> he said. <U+0093>My father stayed behind. He was an old man. And on the day they left, the killers murdered him. They shot him at the back of his home.<U+0094> And he led me into his father<U+0092>s blackened house and pushed open the door to a small, darkened closet. <U+0093>We found him there, on the floor,<U+0094> he said.\nOther Syrian villagers, returning now that the Islamists had fled, told similar stories, of missing women, of bodies in the wreckage. Highways seem to survive wars, as if history insists that the basic geography of a society should remain mapped out amid the ruins for a village<U+0092>s later reconstruction. So on the main road, those who had fled the invaders last August had turned up in pick-up trucks and old cars to see what remained of their homes, to collect what detritus was left.\nIn the neighbouring village of Maardes, I found a woman and her daughter <U+0096> her name was Qamar, which means <U+0093>moon<U+0094>, and they had returned to a real moonscape. She and Qamar found part of a wardrobe and a mat carpet which they loaded pathetically onto a pick-up which a relative had brought up from Hama. In a different age, in 1982, the Muslim Brotherhood <U+0096> a pale ghost compared to the Islamists of today <U+0096> had staged a fearful insurrection in the city, put down with more than equal ferocity by Hafez al-Assad<U+0092>s army all those years ago.\nThe statistics of those long dead civilians who had died in the government<U+0092>s reprisals are as slippery as today<U+0092>s death toll. Was it five or six thousand? Or 20,000 as we journalists claimed at the time?\nMany of the ruins of Hama<U+0092>s old city were bulldozed away to make room for new apartment blocks and a luxury hotel. But a few ancient houses remain beside the ancient <U+0093>nouriah<U+0094> water wheels that still wail and creak away in this haunted city. Its Sunni Muslim citizens are quiet now. Maybe they have learned their terrible lesson. Or maybe the government learned to treat them with respect, leaving new generations with their new-found trade and wealth and schools. Today, its market packed with shoppers, it feels like a memory of the old, dubiously <U+0093>safe<U+0094> dictatorship that dominated Syria before this war; content, subdued, careful, aware <U+0096> to use an old British wartime maxim <U+0096> that <U+0093>careless talk costs lives<U+0094>. Brotherhood prisoners back in 1982 were later slaughtered in a prison massacre at Palmyra.\nThe Ibrahim mosque still displays a three-decade old shell hole in its minaret. But Nusra has not let the city forget its past. Less than a month ago, a suicide bomber set off a truck load of explosives outside the Baath party headquarters. One governor has been assassinated. It<U+0092>s a relief to drive north again to a wooded hillside whose burned trees and massive earth revetments show that it was an artillery position until a few days ago. Two 120mm guns stand on a parapet above the plain of Hama.\nOn top of the hill, there stands the almost untouched shrine of Ali Ibn Hussein al-Abdin, the fourth Imam who survived the seventh century battle of Kerbala, a Shiite holy place <U+0096> the Alawi sect to which the al-Assads belong is Shia <U+0096> and soldiers had arrived from the battlefront to pray and kiss the black marble shrine beneath its cupola of antiquity. A major later stood outside the courtyard and pointed to the horizon. You could see 30 <U+0096> perhaps 40 <U+0096> miles across the flat, featureless countryside where around 7,000 armed opponents of the Assad regime are still fighting to retake the lost villages and cut the desert military supply road to Aleppo. Are they all Nusra men? A few Isis members, no doubt. Perhaps they were the <U+0091>moderate<U+0092> rebels whom David Cameron, a former British prime minister seemingly invented.\nAnd how long before the Syrian army could recapture all those lands which ran seventy miles to Aleppo and linked up to the Turkish border north of the city? The major looked across this vast expanse of territory. Then he pointed to the sky and opened his hands. The gesture said it all. Only God knows.",

He was caught using private email for work purposes while he was trying to take down Hillary Clinton for doing the same. And last week he flat out lied about an FBI letter in clear violation of federal law under the Hatch Act. But just when you think Chaffetz can<U+2019>t be dirtier, it turns out his campaign is literally being funded by a criminal enterprise controlled by overseas investors. \nThe single biggest campaign donor Jason Chaffetz is a company called Nu Skin Enterprises. Research done by Reverb Press has revealed that it adds up to nearly six figures in total, a surreal dollar amount for a fairly obscure company to give to a single Congressmen. But despite the lack of name recognition, Nu Skin is a billion dollar pyramid scheme which pushes questionable anti-aging miracle cures. And it<U+2019>s been busted by the Feds for criminal behavior resulting in tens of millions of dollars in penalties. \nBizarrely, Nu Skin Enterprises is now being bought up by overseas Chinese investors to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, placing the company largely under overseas control even as it<U+2019>s begun its illegal business practices into China. Included in the investors list: family members of former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. So what does this all have to do with Congressman Jason Chaffetz? In short, a busted criminal pyramid scheme now controlled by Chinese political figures has been funding its very own member of Congress from the very start of his political career. In fact, before entering politics, Chaffetz used to be an employee of the company. With each new turn, the story grows stranger.

The dispensary was then raided as part of the enforcement program carried out by Santa Ana police, according to the lawsuit. \nHidden video of the raid released by Pappas shows Santa Ana officers forcing Sky High customers to the floor, profanely referencing James in her wheelchair and munching on snacks. \nThe bust,which went viral, led to the suspension of three police officers, who are no longer employed by the Santa Ana Police Department . \nPolice have not said why the trio aren<U+2019>t with the department. They have been charged with misdemeanor petty theft and scheduled to be back in court next month. \nThe lawsuit alleges police caused extensive damage and took thousands of dollars in cash along with marijuana products during the Sky High raid. \nPappas said he is continuing to pursue petitions in Orange County Superior Court for return of money and items seized in the raid and a lawsuit that seeks other unspecified monetary damages. \nContact the writer: 714-796-7767 [email protected] Twitter: @thechalkoutline",

A Hillary presidency will be surrounded by bitter people, and overt uses of power, along with war, increased taxes and thinly-veiled pay-for-play politics benefiting the billionaires who<U+2019>ve bankrolled her rise to power.\nThe other path is less predictable, but possible just the perfect <U+201C>magic formula<U+201D> they need to get things flowing again.\nThe Brexit vote, a by-product of populist anger against economic stagnation and political angst, was secretly a win for those who wield power from the financial sector.\nIn the end, the disquiet of the people has proven to be the secret ingredient to stirring something up in an economy otherwise stymied by quantitative easing and dismal economic returns.\nAs Zero Hedge explains , it just may be, particularly in light of some of the statements that have been made by significant figures on Wall Street:\nSo yes, inflation is possible, it just can<U+2019>t coexist with political stability, which may explain why <U+2013> according to some more conspiratorial elements <U+2013> a <U+201C>surprising<U+201D> Trump victory on Tuesday may be assured : after all, what better way to unleash political instability than to inaugurate the candidate who promises a full break with the establishment as we know it. If in the process, it leads to a surge in much needed inflation, now that QE has tried and failed, it<U+2019>s a price the establishment, reeling under the weight of record global debt, is willing to pay.\nOne River Asset Management<U+2019>s Eric Peters laying out his inflationary <U+201C>revelation<U+201D>:\n<U+201C>British spenders have entirely looked through post-Brexit uncertainty,<U+201D> said Mark Carney [governor of the Bank of England]. <U+2026> So the Bank of England forecast its biggest inflation overshoot since 1997; expecting 2018 price gains to peak at +2.8%.\nWhat<U+2019>s it tell us?\nA populist uprising, compromised free trade, immigration restrictions, a 15% currency devaluation, 0.50% interest rates combined with aggressive QE is today<U+2019>s magic formula for modestly exceeding a 2% inflation target 2yrs hence. \n[<U+2026>]we live in the 2010s, and inflationary expectations have succumbed to decades of independent central banking. Economic volatility is remarkably muted too. With it has come a long period of political stability. [<U+2026>] And we also know that a long period of political stability is drawing to a close. \nBut we can<U+2019>t be sure that political volatility will increase inflation volatility. Nor can we be sure that it won<U+2019>t. It all depends on time and place. And today<U+2019>s time and place is something new.\nIs this proof that the elite are secretly planning to make lemonade from the lemons of American discontent and the wild card candidacy of Donald Trump?\nThat is a difficult call to make, but it is worth noting that there is clearly an advantage to be held if this outcome does occur.\nAs Tumelar notes, the fix is in either way:\nIt<U+2019>s either inflation by Trump<U+2019>s victory or by WW3 started by Hillary Clinton. \nA hard choice for the banksters. \nOf course, the situation is much more complicated than just inflation, or any one factor. There is a great deal of speculation that the end of QE, known to be no longer effective at stimulating the economy has made a stock market collapse inevitable, subject to the Fed raises rates.\nIt appears that Yellen has been waiting for the outcome of the election, and one way or another, will dump the next crisis on the next president. If that proves to be Trump, he will be blamed for the downfall<U+2026> meanwhile, there will be those waiting in the shadows to profit from disaster.\nFor his part, astute columnist Brandon Smith has consistently argued that the elite have chosen Trump and will allow him to take the presidency <U+2013> only to use the unpredictability as a catalyst for order out of chaos, and the institution of great political and economic controls over the country:\nThe vast majority of analysts in the mainstream and in the alternative media refused to acknowledge the possibility that a successful Brexit actually works in FAVOR of the globalists, because it provides them a perfect scapegoat for a financial crisis that has been broiling for years and is now ready to burst into flames.\n[<U+2026>]\nI argue that the globalists want Trump in office, just as they wanted the passage of the Brexit. I argue that they need conservative movements to feel as though we have won, so that they can pull the rug out from under us in the near future. I argue that we are being set up. \nAgain, the elites are openly telling us what is about to happen. They are telling us that if <U+201C>populists<U+201D> (conservatives) gain political power, the system will effectively collapse. To what extent is hard to say, but let<U+2019>s assume that the situation will be ugly enough to influence the masses to reconsider the ideal of globalism as a possible solution. The elites are fond of the Hegelian dialectic and the philosophy of <U+201C>order out of chaos,<U+201D> after all.\nAgain, the reasons parallel the reasons that Brexit was able to succeed in spite of fierce establishment opposition.\nThe master manipulators are adaptive to any market conditions, and their influence runs deeper than the electorate of any given political season. Its agents and officers instruct the candidates and make demands, not the other way around.\nIn a puppeteer<U+2019>s world, must we always argue for the existence of puppets on every stage?\nRead more: \n<U+201C>Trump Will Be ALLOWED To Win,<U+201D> Only to Be Blamed For The Coming Financial Crash \nThe Bubble Will Burst, But Fed Is Waiting For Politics <U+201C>With Trump Lurking Around<U+201D> \nTrump Accuses Fed of Not Raising Rates Because Obama <U+201C>Doesn<U+2019>t Want a Bubble Burst<U+201D> Until He Leaves \nRon Paul: Unless the Fed is Stopped, America Will <U+201C>Soon Experience Major Economic Crisis<U+201D> \n<U+201C>Fed Risks Triggering Panic and Turmoil<U+201D>: World Bank Warns Against Raising Rates \n",

Jeff tells us how he has been involved in White Nationalism for around 25 years and reminds us of the sacrifices that many good men have made over that time to promote our cause, being imprisoned or physically attacked for their beliefs. The NSM is a political movement as well as being involved in street activism, so they are involved in a lot of community outreach work. Jeff talks about how their roots go back to George Lincoln Rockwell and the only groups that have legitimate ties to his movement are the New Order and the NSM. He was taught by the people who had learned from him and public service was always a part of what they were doing. \nJason asks what it was like to be a political skinhead involved in National Socialism and what changes he has seen in his time. Years ago a fight just used to be a fight, but nowadays you can be hit with hate crime charges as well, which can lead to lengthy prison sentences and ruined lives, just for a fistfight that may not have even involved racial politics. You cannot even defend your life any more without being charged with hate crime, as we have seen recently in Britain, where activists have received serious jail time for defending themselves against violent antifa in Kent. Jeff is banned from Britain as well as Matt, not due to any criminal activity but just because his speech is politically incorrect. Matt reminds us that the reason for this is because they have no answer to our talking points. They cannot debate us so they always seek to shut us down. \nThe NSM will be taking an important role in the new Nationalist Front alliance with the TWP and Jeff talks about previous attempts to do this before, where good people have tried to broker a peace between the various organisations but due to petty reasons were never able to achieve it. He explains how the main problem has always been personality issues, where people have an issue with someone and then make up stories about them to cause problems. \nThe TWP and the NSM will be at a national rally together at the state capital of Pennsylvania on November 5th and all are welcome, especially other organisations. Jeff reminds us that although it is good to be promoting stuff on the internet, real political change has always been made on the streets. He suggests that if people are worried of being caught on camera, they should just wear a hat and sunglasses. Matt points out that he has never met anyone at an event that he has ever then gone on to have problems with on the internet. \nFor the last part of the podcast Jeff talks about how he has worked to modernise the NSM, distancing them from German symbols and concentrating on American ones instead. He has taken some flak for this but believes that if we want to win, then we will have to start taking risks, after all, who dares wins. \nPresented by Matthew Heimbach and Jason Augustus with special guest Jeff Schoep \nThe Daily Traditionalist: Jeff Schoep and the NSM <U+00E2><U+0080><U+0093> DT 102816",

And while his first meeting with the former secretary of state left him unimpressed with her positions on the issues of racial inequality and social justice on which he advocates, Mckesson said Clinton has since developed a strong grasp on them. Story Continued Below Mckesson was an active participant in major protests in Baltimore; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Ferguson, Missouri. He was part of a group of activists who met with President Barack Obama, law enforcement officials and politicians at the White House earlier this summer to discuss the relationship between police and the African-American community. Specifically, Mckesson wrote that Clinton<U+2019>s racial justice platform is strong because <U+201C>it is informed by the policy failings of the past and is a vision for where we need to go.<U+201D> He praised her proposals on policing practices and criminal justice reform, as well as her economic package, which he said is <U+201C>akin to a New Deal.<U+201D> <U+201C>When I met with her last week, it was clear that she now understands these issues well at a policy level and that she has researched the implications of the positions that she has proposed,<U+201D> Mckesson wrote. <U+201C>In this meeting, she spoke both about the context of change and the concrete actions necessary to open new pathways of equity and justice.<U+201D> Mckesson was clear that he does not agree with Clinton on everything and called on the Democratic nominee to call for the abolition of a federal program that allows for the seizure of money and property from individuals who have not been convicted of a crime. He also urged her to oppose the death penalty and fight for its elimination. <U+201C>But elections do have consequences,<U+201D> Mckesson wrote, which is why he said he will be voting for Clinton. He said the <U+201C>Make America Great Again<U+201D> slogan that GOP nominee Donald Trump has used on the campaign trail harkens back to a time of racial and religious prejudice in the U.S., when Jim Crow laws <U+201C>masqueraded as the will of the people.<U+201D> <U+201C>I often hear some of my peers say that they may not vote, that a Donald Trump presidency would bring about a productive apocalypse <U+2014> that the system would grind to a halt and force us to confront everything that is wrong with the system,<U+201D> he wrote. <U+201C>But we know that the system will not come to a grinding halt; it never has. In a Trump administration, the system would surely grind us , black and brown folks, even more than it already does.<U+201D> <U+201C>Trump is the first major-party candidate in recent memory who campaigns expressly on moving backward from today. It<U+2019>s the only way he wins,<U+201D> he added. <U+201C>Clinton has the plan to move American forward.

This young man grew up in a fairly disadvantaged neighborhood, in a fairly disadvantaging city, in a very disadvantaging nation <U+2014> all the result of our shared history of slavery and institutional inequality that allows American cops to choke blacks on Youtube and go home and play with the kids. Now, on a day that promised to be a new dawn in American politics but that looks increasingly like our racial dusk, it occurs to me that this young man came to me not only out of intellectual striving but existential worry. How can any black American securely exist in a country where his or her future is haunted by the past, making the present an almost-impossible-to-embrace moment of both hope and fear? In putting democracy to work, Americans elected Donald J. Trump to be 45th president of the United States, so we are about find out. This student wasn<U+2019>t actually talking about time travel, of course. Rather, immersed in the black political genre of Afrofuturism <U+2014> wherein blacks use the imaginative soil of science fiction and fantasy to reframe debates about colonialism, racism, otherness and political legitimacy <U+2014> he wanted to think about the way blacks experience time differently from whites. Now that idea may strike you as absurd. A second is a second, a minute has 60 of them, an hour has 60 minutes, there are 24 hours in a day, and a day is the same for everyone. Well, of course that<U+2019>s true. But that doesn<U+2019>t mean the experience of those days adds up as neatly as the ticking of the universal clock suggests. James Baldwin, for example, argued relentlessly that whites believe they are white because they consistently forget their history. In failing to deal honestly with the legacy of white supremacy, whites embrace their sense of identity as bound up with American virtue and in doing so they obscure notions of responsibility and culpability for historical wrongs and horrors that no reasonable person can deny took place. Baldwin felt that in refusing to deal honestly with the fact that their prosperity depends entirely on a history of black exploitation, rape, murder and pillage, whites imbue their identity with an innocence that allows them to see the future as open and free and their minutes and days as pregnant with possibility and power. What happens in these instances is indeed a warping of time. The laws of the universe are experienced without friction for white Americans because a willful denial of the past leaves them with no sense that their present is insecure or that their future is in question. It will always be O.K. in exactly one minute, day, or year from now. But this is not many blacks<U+2019> experience of time. Rather, many blacks are now morbidly amused by America<U+2019>s newfound horror over black death at the hands of the state. <U+201C>We must do something to stop this tragedy!<U+201D> the newly awakened shout. But for us there is nothing new in this. Indeed, if we had been truly listened to so many decades ago the timeline of many innocent blacks would have been extended; the histories of so many families would be marked by more Christmases spent together; the futures of so many of the young and living would not be tinged with the apathy born of doubt and skepticism. These people <U+2014> I suspect my graduate student is among them <U+2014> would not look to tomorrow wondering if it really is in their power to change. We talk unceasingly in this country about pulling oneself up by the bootstraps, but doing so isn<U+2019>t only a matter of managing action, it is also about planning action, and doing that depends on what one really thinks an American minute amounts to. To say at this point that his candidacy was controversial is, well, uncontroversial. In the time he made his case to the people we came to learn that he believes <U+201C>the<U+201D> African-Americans live in hell <U+2014> linguistically defining us as a monolithic block of existential misery worthy of pity and more police. We learned that racial paranoia can be expressed openly by whites and left unchallenged; that nonwhite voters left unmonitored would <U+201C>steal<U+201D> the election; that the powerful can grab women by the genitals without remorse; that finding every way he could to avoid paying taxes and betting on a housing crisis was just called <U+201C>business.<U+201D> All this indicates a man for whom normal expectations <U+2014> what is supposed to happen a minute from now <U+2014> are null and void. That he has been elected to the nation<U+2019>s highest office indicates a largely white electorate that believes that the country<U+2019>s future should be in the hands of a man to whom the present has no causal relationship to the past, and thinks that the future is what we make of it. Trump secured a mere 8 percent of the black vote. One way to think of a cast ballot is as an instrument of democratic voice, a way of legitimizing those who hold power. But another way to think about voting is that it represents a means of securing a kind of future. Barack Obama<U+2019>s slogan, <U+201C>Change We Can Believe In<U+201D> evoked in the minds of the people a sense of future possibilities bound only by what we collectively agree to imagine together. But Trump, displaying during his campaign every form of racial disregard one can imagine, as validated and certified by the Ku Klux Klan , pledges to <U+201C>Make America Great Again.<U+201D> The other 92 percent of voting blacks see, not a change-seeking, future-altering movement like #BlackLivesMatter, but a clear white supremacist sentiment given voice in the highest political office in the land. Those who know history must certainly be reminded of 1865, when Andrew Johnson took office determined to undo Reconstruction. Baldwin wrote to his nephew in 1962, <U+201C>[Whites] are, in effect, still trapped in a history which they do not understand; and until they understand it, they cannot be released from it.<U+201D> Today, President-elect Donald Trump gives little reason for blacks and sympathetic whites to think he doesn<U+2019>t intend on taking us all back more than a century in order to seek his American greatness.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/electromagnetic-control-grids-division.html I said it before, the way people are controlled is through setting them in opposition with each other. The only way people regain control is if they work with each other for a beneficial future. The only way this falls apart is if people are fighting each other over petty things.It<U+2019>s all so much deeper than we are told. They didn<U+2019>t just invent petty products<U+2019> for this <U+201C>world<U+201D> this <U+201C>universe,<U+201D> they introduced a whole spiritual soul-trading system by the use of electromagnetic frequency nets. The state of the original human is eternal, but with this system the population is recycled over and over in time.Active DNA is a physical thing that pulls information from what is called the <U+201C>aether<U+201D> (other realities) and manifests it physically in this reality. If DNA is targeted , i.e. by the system just mentioned, then other realities can also be manipulated in instances where the DNA is active. That is what this is all about: The Universe, time, and the Earth are naturally a multi-dimensional existence of which those other realities, times and planes were influenced because of the manipulation that took place here.To say it another way, the divisive control grid has had access to higher dimensions and therefore the soul-energy of Humanity, and the non-physical realms we are connected with.This is out of balance and cannot remain this way forever. It is leading up to a fulcrum of experience in which the forces at play must reach a completion of cycles.The way we can fix this is by becoming aware of the hidden knowledge which is literally the invisible energy of the mental and emotional bodies. We must see how Humanity is being manipulated, or blocked from our higher awareness.The off-the-wall explanation is that physical reality manifests out of the collective unconscious.Which also means that when each person on Earth clears their unconscious of all the debris and toxins stuck in their <U+2018>fields<U+2019> then we all will experience life on Earth at a frequency which reflects that healing.To get to this healed <U+201C>timeline<U+201D> we have to go through a healing process. This process is cathartic and involves expelling the toxins of mind and body and is painful in and of itself.In previous times this has been a <U+201C>washing machine<U+201D> cycle where people get tossed in and every so many thousand years some people get out while the rest are recycled.This time may be the fulfillment of those cycles where the entire bunch gets released at once.The idea is that if people are not prepared for this they will experience the chaos of a simultaneous clearing and healing.Instead of painful healing spread out over months or years, it would all occur in a matter of days or weeks.This is the time to take steps to represent ourselves. The follow the herd mindset is how people are manipulated and controlled mentally and physically.We have to connect and work together, really work together, not just messaging and posting meme pictures which is just another way of control.To the credit of this process it can be said that truth is spreading so fast because of that ability to convert the topics and knowledge into meme images and other quick bits of information that can be shared and understood within seconds. Instead of minutes to hours of discussion or documentary, condensed images with captions can describe a complex situation to the fullest of its true exaggeration without having to explain hours of backstory and research.However, few people own it all. Fewer people still have advanced technology that allows for a <U+201C>futuristic<U+201D> existence without the problems people are challenged by today. And even fewer people than that have the knowledge of the true human history.What is not realized is that the shock of Humanity finding out about the origins of time and space is going to be far greater than figuring out that they were manipulated this entire time by people with greater knowledge.The real truth under all the supposition is a complete disconnection from every school of thought which is currently accepted. It<U+2019>s completely beyond normal into the realm of paranormal, time loops, altered consciousness and DNA, soul-knowledge, eternity, quantum superimposition guided by imagination and attitude, and that it all happens right here<U+2026> but is invisible to the 5-senses .Currently the development of that which interprets energy from beyond the 5-senses has been purposely ridiculed and categorized to push people away from finding the truth so easily. One could say this is for control as much as it is protection of the current system as much as it is for a challenge of their own spiritual values.To take this a step further, imagine we are in a simulator of sorts, designed by the intelligence behind the <U+201C>Multiverse<U+201D> (or even something more personal).If so, then what does it mean when people fight and hurt each other for material things? Do we say, they were just doing what they needed to or they are just in a simulator?Or is this is a way of seeing who would do what, in what kind of situations, in a way that cannot be repeated, or in a way that cannot be falsified without dumping self-responsibility?Or it may be a test, a manipulation, a challenge or a learning process all at once using confusion and fear to control Humanity.In truth we have the capabilities and tools to remove this mental confusion and fear. In reality the mind is naturally beyond polarity as it is capable of abstracting from eternity.Right now or minds are polarity based and this is the source of disturbance in our world. By doing so we are trading that transcendence, our true heritage, for a polarized world by being disconnected from that eternal source which is the emanation of the soul and spirit through our body.That is also why people say there are souled beings and non souled here because the other beings came from a Universe that is not connected with the source of this Universe. It is as if they cut across timelines to get to us.Our completion out of polarity, our expansion out of paradox and into eternal meaning, would not be the same as the non-souled. Actually one would cancel out the other, for if we reached completion and they did not then their occurrence of interjection would be experienced as a time loop which does not complete.If they reached completion and ours did not, we would experience the completion cycle of another Universe<U+2019>s being which would not resonate or return <U+201C>soul-knowledge<U+201D> to the source people are connected with.This is in part why people are saying <U+201C>ascension<U+201D> is the way out. Because if the time loops are severed then it would be a planck time fractal repetition into infinite and those without the ability to navigate <U+201C>hyperspace<U+201D> would become one of with the void. If this is to happen or either way, one must learn to navigate the spiritual world because that is the real playing field.The big issue is not that we have stuff happening on Earth.The issue is that the real playing field, the spiritual planes, have been targeted and infiltrated as far as this imbalance goes. When we become aware of the knowledge of experience on the soul level we can bring harmony back to the overall system and when enough people do this <U+201C>the grid<U+201D> (or spiritual soul-trading system) cannot work with the harmonious energy.There is no way to use harmonious energy and manipulate it to serve a personal need, it always serves the whole.

In an electorate as deeply divided as we currently see in this country, you expect no less. But ask yourself this question: If your candidate loses, are you ready to take up arms and try to overthrow the government? For some who ardently support GOP nominee Donald Trump, the answer is a resounding yes. \nTake for example Jared Halbrook, who lives in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and told the New York Times : <U+201C>People are going to march on the capitols. They<U+2019>re going to do whatever needs to be done to get her out of office, because she does not belong there. <U+201C>If push comes to shove, (Clinton) has to go by any means necessary, it will be done.<U+201D> \nRoger Pillath said he also sees violence on the horizon if Clinton is elected: <U+201C>It<U+2019>s not what I<U+2019>m going to do, but I<U+2019>m scared that the country is going to go into a riot. I<U+2019>ve never seen the country so divided, just black and white <U+2014> there<U+2019>s no compromise whatsoever. The Clinton campaign says together we are stronger, but there<U+2019>s no together. The country has never been so divided. I<U+2019>m looking at revolution right now.<U+201D> \nAs Trump continues to talk of the election being <U+201C>rigged,<U+201D> his words are having an effect on people like Paul Swick, who had this ominous warning: <U+201C>If she comes after the guns, it<U+2019>s going to be a rough, bumpy road. I hope to God I never have to fire a round, but I won<U+2019>t hesitate to. As a Christian, I want reformation. But sometimes reformation comes through bloodshed.<U+201D> \nRetired truck driver Alan Weegens envisions a very dark future for the United States and says he<U+2019>s ready to do whatever is necessary: <U+201C>I am not going to take my weapon to go out into the streets to protest an election I did not win. But I think that if certain events came about, a person would need to protect themselves, depending on where they lived, when your neighborhood goes up in flames.<U+201D> \nSee if you can recall the last time we heard this kind of violent talk which led to actions by far right nuts who were inspired to be <U+201C>heroes<U+201D> in their own minds. The year was 1995 and Bill Clinton was President. Timothy McVeigh parked a rental truck loaded with explosives outside the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and killed 168 innocent Americans, including children.

But the Obama administration said three-fourths of consumers would still be able to find plans for less than $100 a month with the help of federal subsidies. The open enrollment period under President Obama <U+2019>s signature health law begins on Nov. 1, but consumers got their first look at their options on Monday. Consumers who go without insurance next year could face possible tax penalties of $700 a person or more. In many parts of the country, the available options are sure to become part of the political conversation in the election season<U+2019>s closing days. And the rising costs and shrinking options all but ensure that the next president will need to make significant adjustments to the health law, something both Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump have promised. The average increase of 25 percent in benchmark premiums on the federal exchange compares with increases of 2 percent in 2015 and 7 percent this year. Major insurers have pulled out of the public marketplace in many states, citing multimillion-dollar losses, and state officials have approved rate increases of 25 to 50 percent or more for some insurers that remain. One in five consumers on the federal health insurance website HealthCare.gov will find only one insurer with offerings next year, the administration said. For a 27-year-old consumer, in the prime age group sought by insurers, the average monthly premium for a benchmark plan would be $302 next year, up from $242 this year, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services . <U+201C>While the president<U+2019>s allies in Washington will try to spin the numbers, families across the country will be forced to figure out how to pay for such unaffordable insurance,<U+201D> said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who is an opponent of the Affordable Care Act and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over much of the law. The administration minimized the marketplace<U+2019>s troubles. Officials said people could lower their costs by seeking income-based subsidies in the form of tax credits and by switching to less expensive plans. While some markets will have few choices, consumers nationwide will see an average of 10 plans per insurer. Plans vary in cost and cover different doctors, hospitals and drugs. The Obama administration said last week that it expected monthly enrollment in the Affordable Care Act marketplace to average 11.4 million next year, up from a monthly average of 10.5 million this year. But five million to seven million people who buy insurance on their own do not receive federal subsidies. <U+201C>The number of people eligible for tax credits will increase<U+201D> as premiums rise next year, and the amount of assistance will also increase, Kevin Griffis, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said. Under the federal health law, insurance plans are classified in four levels: bronze, silver, gold and platinum, depending on the amount of coverage. <U+201C>If every returning consumer nationwide selected the lowest-cost plan within the same metal level they picked last year, average premiums <U+2014> taking into account financial assistance <U+2014> would fall by $28 per month, or 20 percent, compared with 2016,<U+201D> Kathryn E. Martin, an acting assistant secretary of health and human services, said. But in many places, the options have shrunk. Laura M. Schlett, 44, of Brandon, Miss., a suburb of Jackson, said she was losing coverage because her insurer, UnitedHealth, was pulling out of the public marketplace there, as in many other states. Ms. Schlett said that she received a subsidy of $110 a month and spent $240 a month for health insurance with a $3,000 deductible this year. <U+201C>I can<U+2019>t afford to get sick after paying for the health insurance,<U+201D> Ms. Schlett said. In Phoenix, only one insurer, Health Net, a subsidiary of Centene, is listed on HealthCare.gov, and it is offering only four plans for 2017. A Phoenix family of four with income of $62,000 a year could obtain a premium tax credit of $1,079 a month next year, but would still owe $342 a month, or roughly $4,100 a year, and the policy has an annual deductible of $14,100 for the family, according to HealthCare.gov . In Raleigh, N.C., 18 plans are available for 2017 from two insurers, but the premiums could be a substantial expense for some consumers. For a 53-year-old man with income of $53,000 a year, the cheapest midlevel silver plan will cost $714 a month, or $8,568 a year, according to the federal website, and no subsidy would be available. But a man of the same age with income of $25,000 a year could get a subsidy of $639 a month, reducing his premium to $75 a month, or $900 a year. In Eugene, Ore., the cheapest silver plan available to a 35-year-old man has a full, unsubsidized premium of $348 a month, or $4,176 a year, and an annual deductible of $3,000. A total of 14 plans are available from two insurers. In Charleston, W.Va., consumers have a choice of 16 plans offered by two insurers. For a 40-year-old woman, the cheapest silver plan has a full, unsubsidized premium of $505 a month, or $6,060 a year, and an annual deductible of $6,150. If the woman has annual income of $30,000, she could get a subsidy of $326 a month, but would still owe premiums of $179 a month, or about $2,150 a year. Stabilizing the insurance marketplace could be a major challenge for Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate for president, if she wins, as opinion polls suggest she will. The assurances by the Obama administration on Monday differed in tone from Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s remarks on the campaign trail. She has supported the Affordable Care Act, but denounced <U+201C>skyrocketing out-of-pocket health costs<U+201D> and said the federal government should have the power to block or modify unreasonable rate increases so coverage would be more affordable.

The next president made his name in real estate in Manhattan. The next president began his campaign at his New York City skyscraper, cast his vote at a nearby public school and celebrated his victory at a Midtown hotel. And the next president lost at the polls in all those places on Tuesday. New Yorkers overwhelmingly voted against Donald J. Trump , one of their own, went home and woke up with him as the winner. Feelings of hometown pride in the Republican nominee<U+2019>s victory were generally absent on Wednesday, the city<U+2019>s mood framed by a shawl of gray clouds. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think any New Yorkers slept,<U+201D> said Maye Le<U+00F3>n, 39, a hair stylist in East Harlem. The feeling of loss was magnified by the shock of it, not just for New Yorkers but for all those who voted for Hillary Clinton , the Democratic nominee, and believed her victory was a sure bet, even as the sun set and polls closed on Tuesday. That her victory proved to be an illusion, so much smoke, left many <U+2014> mainly in New York, along the East Coast and on the West Coast <U+2014> wondering how they could have gotten it so wrong. Were they that locked in an echo chamber of the like-minded? <U+201C>I never even considered the possibility that Hillary would lose,<U+201D> said Shirley Wu, 26, a student at New York University. <U+201C>Because I didn<U+2019>t know a single person voting against her.<U+201D> As a construction worker, Eve Galarza, 39, put it: <U+201C>They elected him. It says a whole lot about America.<U+201D> As if that were some strange land. Michael Moran, 65, an artist who used to live near the former home of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s family in Jamaica Estates, Queens, said the surprise of the result depressed him. <U+201C>I feel funny about the country,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>I feel out of touch.<U+201D> The last New Yorker to be elected president rode <U+201C>a political cataclysm, unprecedented in the nation<U+2019>s history,<U+201D> according to The New York Times the next day. That was in 1932, and his name was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. On Wednesday in New York, the new political cataclysm felt to many not homegrown but like something that started someplace else and washed up here. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t really understand the country as well as I thought I did,<U+201D> said Tristan Chirico, 32, a student in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. <U+201C>I feel gaslit, like I<U+2019>m going crazy. I can<U+2019>t fathom how this is possible.<U+201D> Another Crown Heights resident, Alison Benko, 23, said, <U+201C>I felt like I woke up and my country was stolen.<U+201D> And yet, it was not. For all the talk of a <U+201C>rigged election,<U+201D> there has not been a hint of impropriety regarding the actual voting. What was actually stolen, perhaps, was a portrait of the country that many people carried. <U+201C>New York City is liberal, and I think people weren<U+2019>t seeing beyond that,<U+201D> said Rosalie Kaufman, 71, at a museum in Mr. Roosevelt<U+2019>s former home on East 65th Street in Manhattan. <U+201C>They saw what they wanted to see.<U+201D> She added: <U+201C>I love New York. I will always live here, but it doesn<U+2019>t represent the United States.<U+201D> A student at Hunter College, Hector Lorenzo, 34, of Washington Heights, leaned on a wrought-iron fence outside the 32nd president<U+2019>s former home and considered the election of the 45th. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m shocked,<U+201D> he said of the results. <U+201C>I guess you figure there will be some division in the country. But this is more widespread, and scarier, than I thought it was.<U+201D> Like many, Holly Rilinger, 42, a fitness trainer in Manhattan, posted about the election on Facebook: <U+201C>I woke up more upset with how blind-sided I feel,<U+201D> she wrote. <U+201C>How insulated I have allowed myself to become. How in the world have I become so completely disconnected from the rest of the country? I have mid-western roots.<U+201D> Kristina Blaine, 36, from Rego Park, Queens, saw both sides of the election within her own family, spread around New York, Ohio and Florida. She visited Trump Tower in Manhattan on Wednesday holding a sign that read: <U+201C>Some of my family voted for Trump. I am sorry America.<U+201D> She regretted not trying to change minds: <U+201C>Instead of rocking the boat with my family, I didn<U+2019>t,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>I could have done more.<U+201D> Early in the presidential campaign, Ted Cruz<U+2019>s derogatory accusation that Mr. Trump was a symbol of <U+201C>New York values<U+201D> was roundly mocked in the city itself. Now, with his victory, Mr. Trump, for better or worse, really is the face of New York in the White House, a born-and-raised son of the city representing the nation to the rest of the planet. New Yorkers reflected on his New York values, some with praise. <U+201C>In this city, you have to be respectful of everyone,<U+201D> said Luis Estrella, 63, from Elmhurst, Queens. <U+201C>He<U+2019>s from New York, so I think he<U+2019>s going to be tolerant of everyone, even though he has said the opposite. That<U+2019>s just noise.<U+201D> Rafael Gonzales, 66, of Washington Heights, said he had jumped up and hugged his television when the election swung Mr. Trump<U+2019>s way and shouted, <U+201C>S<U+00ED>, muchacho!<U+201D> <U+201C>He was born here and who are you if you don<U+2019>t do something for your people?<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>He<U+2019>s going to do well because New Yorkers get along with everybody.<U+201D> Others suggested the new New Yorker in Washington would not be representative of his roots, but more of a city caricature. <U+201C>He<U+2019>s always so negative, always criticizing everything,<U+201D> said Margie Rivera, 61, who lives in East Harlem. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s not New York.<U+201D> Enissia Rivera, 23, speaking near Trump Tower, twisted it the other way. <U+201C>He<U+2019>s not a New Yorker,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>It takes morals, and he doesn<U+2019>t have any.<U+201D> Marcin Perkowski, a foreman at a hotel construction site in Manhattan <U+2014> a job seemingly near and dear to the president-elect <U+2014> suggested it was too soon to pass judgment. <U+201C>I think we will see after four years,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Right now it<U+2019>s been less than 24 hours and nothing has changed.<U+201D> And yet, for many, everything had. Correction: November 9, 2016 An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a foreman at a hotel construction site in Manhattan. He is Marcin Perkowski, not Marafino.

Shim worked for Iranian broadcaster Press TV as a foreign correspondent covering wars, legitimate protests and fake uprisings in multiple countries. \nVia AnonHQ \n\nShe reported live from Syria, Iraq, Turkey, and Lebanon during the conflict since 2011, including in the critical region of Daraa during the beginning of protests, which are misrepresented by American media as the reasons for the fake civil war. Serena Shim was killed two years ago on October 19, 2014, in Turkey while reporting on the intense battle for the Syrian border city of Kobani which was the focus of international media attention. She was 29 when she died.\nScroll Down For Video Below! The city of Kobani, which has one of Turkey<U+2019>s major border crossings with Syria, because it was under threat of being completely captured by the Islamic State. The US was forced to respond because Islamic State grew out of control and threatened the border stability of Turkey, and it became the first major area bombed during the US campaign in Syria.\nThe US and Turkey were also arguing over Washington<U+2019>s plan to arm Kurdish fighters on the Syrian side of the border and how to allow Kurds from Iraq to support the effort by crossing through Turkey. On the day she was killed, the US began operations to airdrop weapons to the Kurds. Less than two days later, Islamic State fighters released a video showing the capture of an American weapons cache airdropped near the city. The video received international media attention which led the Pentagon to admit the weapons mistakenly reached ISIL terrorists.\nIt is claimed she was killed in a car accident with a cement truck. However, physical details about the case raise questions about the official explanation by Turkish officials. There are also conflicting stories about the timeline after her death and before the family received her body, which indicate actions by the government of Turkey and possibly the United States.\nTwo days before her death, Serena Shim reported on live international television that Turkish intelligence services were planning to arrest her for questioning on the suspicion her being a spy. The day after her death, US officials denied releasing any information it had about whether the US government was aware of Turkey<U+2019>s plans. State Department officials told WTF News it would be December 2017 before a Freedom of Information Act request could be completed for information on what actions were taken by them to assist her as a US citizen.\nSerena Shim conducted an undercover investigation in Turkey and Syria lasting multiple months during 2012 as she spoke fluent Arabic. Her report aired on Press TV beginning in December 2012. The issues listed below are topics she reported on first or experienced in person before they were reported by major media outlets. US officials continue to hide her death and not a single major media outlet in America reported on her death at the time despite the fact that she was popular in America and the Middle East.\n1. HILLARY CLINTON<U+2019>S EMAILS PROVE THE US STATE DEPT AND WHITE HOUSE KNEW SAUDI ARABIA AND QATAR ARE FUNDING ISLAMIC STATE \nClinton admitted, in an email conversation from August 2014 obtained by Wikileaks, that US allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar were sending money and weapons to ISIL. August 2014 was the height of terror during Islamic State<U+2019>s rise, leading to the growing international media outrage which forced President Obama to publicly announce the beginning of airstrikes against ISIL in Syria on September 23, 2014.\nTHE FREE THOUGHT PROJECT \n<U+201C>While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>The Qataris and Saudis will be put in a position of balancing policy between their ongoing competition to dominate the Sunni world and the consequences of serious U.S. pressure.<U+201D> \nThe business newspaper Financial Times reported that Prince Saud al-Faisal admitted Saudi Arabia created and funded Islamic State as a response to the US supporting Shia powers in Iraq. The FT also reported in 2013that Qatar had already spent $3 billion on funding the opposition.\nAmerica<U+2019>s top military official General Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked <U+201C>Do you know any major Arab ally that embraces ISIL?<U+201D> by Republican Senator Lindsay Graham. <U+201C>I know major Arab allies who fund them,<U+201D> replied Dempsey.\n2. THE UNITED STATES WANTED THE ISLAMIC STATE TO GROW, AS PROVED BY LEAKED INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENTS \nThe rapid growth of the Islamic State was not an accident, and many observers of the conflict questioned the US commitment to fighting terrorism as they ignored the group<U+2019>s rise. Since the start of the armed conflict in 2011, United States officials including Hillary Clinton have publicly stated that their solution to stop the war is to replace Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other government leaders. The public policy of the United States has been to support what the US calls moderate opposition groups under the name Free Syrian Army (FSA) with the goal of having them weaken the government forces.\nThat strategy changed in mid-2012 as news reports confirmed these rebels were committing war crimes by killing civilians and executing soldiers. One of the largest factions Al Nusra was specifically identified as a terrorist group in December 2012. At the same time, the Islamic State (known as Al Qaeda in Iraq) was growing in Syria and had become a dominant force by 2013. The Islamic State grew in Syria for almost two years before the US announced it would take military action in September 2014. The intelligence report was dated August 2012 confirms the US government would have known about this threat for two years.\nJUDICIAL WATCH <U+201C>If the situation unravels, there is the possibility of establishing a declared or undeclared Salafist Principality in eastern Syria (Hasaka and Der Zor), and this is exactly what the supporting powers to the opposition want, in order to isolate the Syrian regime, which is considered the strategic depth of the Shia expansion (Iraq and Iran).<U+201D>Syria has been fought over for two separate gas pipeline projects, a pipeline from Qatar rejected by Assad for one from Iran. The second pipeline is a Russian plan to connect with Turkey to deliver gas to Europe; the deal was finalized less than two weeks ago.\n",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Gillian \n source: shiftfrequency.com \n text: Leave a reply \nOrly Levy <U+2013> Have you ever been around or noticed someone that made you feel good? They weren<U+2019>t intentionally trying to, there was just something about their energy that allowed you to relax and enjoy yourself more. Most likely, this person had a high vibration and that<U+2019>s why you were attracted to them and felt good being around them. Similarly, have you ever heard someone say <U+201C>there was a good vibe<U+201D> describing a situation? That person must have experienced a positive interaction and described it in terms of the energy felt. \nYou might be wondering what having a high vibration means. As humans we are all energy in motion and we vibrate a frequency out to the universe. People who have a high vibration often feel lighter, open, stable and loving. While feelings of heaviness, denseness, darkness and fear are found in the lower vibration zone. Just like radio stations have different frequencies and you can tune into whatever you want to listen to, people can raise their vibration (change their frequency) in order to feel better. \nAfter learning about energy in tai chi and yoga, I began to become aware of my own vibes. When I was moody or upset about something, I noticed I felt heavy and people avoided me. When I was happy and felt good about life, I felt open and people seemed attracted to me. I also became aware of how I disliked feeling this low vibration and that around certain people I either felt better or worst. I realized that rather than being at the mercy of my mood and other people<U+2019>s energy field , I could do activities that raised my vibration and made me feel better. The key here is that anything the makes you feel authentically good raises your vibrations. \nHere is a list of 12 ways you can naturally raise your vibration and feel better: 1. Breathe. \nBreathing is the best way to clear your energy and create openness in your heart. When you breathe deeply your belly expands on the inhale and contracts on the exhale. Put your hand on your belly to check that you are breathing fully and deeply. 2. Exercise. \nAny form of exercise the gets your heart rate going and feels fun (not forced), raises your vibrations. 3. Laugh. \nLaughter is a fun and easy way to feel good. Find a way to add some laughter into your daily routine and you will feel the difference. 4. Watch cartoons. \nCartoons feel light and cozy. They remind you a being a kid and feeling safe. Cartoons often carry messages of love and protection. 5. Say Affirmations. \nBy reciting affirmations you are reminding your conscious mind that what you desire is here and now. Anything is possible and you are shining light on truth. 6. Pray. \nPrayer doesn<U+2019>t have to be something you practice in a religious setting. You can connect, ask for guidance, and give thanks to God or the universe at any time and at any place. 7. Dress up. \nSometimes putting on a nice dress and red lip stick feels good. It reminds us of how sexy, feminine and fun we can be. 8. Count your blessings. \nWhat are you grateful for? Gratitude for all the love, support and abundance that is already present in your life is the fastest way to feel good. 9. Give. \nDo something nice for someone else for no reason at all. Not because you want something in return or you owe them, but because you want to share your love. 10. Say <U+201C>I love you.<U+201D> \nTell the people you love, <U+201C>I love you unconditionally no matter what.<U+201D> Say it out loud even if you think they already know and then close your eyes and feel it. 11. Tell yourself the same. \nEvery ounce of love you give out starts with you. Remember to show yourself the love and receive it! 12. Spoil yourself with something you<U+2019>ve been desiring but saving for when you felt worthy. \nDo something fun and exciting. Your life is now, the time is now and feel your vibration raise tenfold. \nRaising your vibration leads to feeling good, free and loved. When you follow your feelings and raise your vibration you are not only helping yourself feel better but you are positively impacting everyone around you. Your energy doesn<U+2019>t stop with you, it radiates out in the universe and touches the entire planet. Once you raise your vibrations you will also be less likely to get sucked into someone else<U+2019>s low energy vibration. Imagine being around someone you love that is struggling and helping them by just being yourself and radiating your energy out. \nIn the comments below I<U+2019>d love to hear from you. What are your favorite ways to raise your vibration? \nOrly Levy is an Intuitive Life Coach and Writer based in Southern California.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said he was <U+201C>sickened by what I<U+00A0>heard<U+201D> and disclosed that Mr. Trump had been uninvited from a joint<U+00A0>appearance on Saturday in Wisconsin. The Trump campaign said vice<U+00A0>presidential nominee Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, would go<U+00A0>instead. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has worked to build bridges between the party and the Trump campaign, said <U+201C>No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about<U+00A0>in this manner. Ever.<U+201D> Sen. Mark Kirk (R., Ill.), who is in a tight re-election battle and had already withdrawn his endorsement of Mr. Trump in June after the candidate mocked a man with a disability, said Mr.<U+00A0>Trump should quit the presidential contest. On Twitter, he<U+00A0>wrote: <U+201C>@realDonaldTrump should drop out. @GOP should engage rules for<U+00A0>emergency replacement.<U+201D> Sen. Mike Lee of Utah issued a statement after midnight EDT saying Mr. Trump should step aside as nominee. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s time for us not to settle; it<U+2019>s time for us to expect more,<U+201D> said Mr. Lee, calling on Mr. Trump to <U+201C>allow someone else to carry to banner<U+201D> of GOP principles. Reps. Barbara Comstock of Virginia and Mike Coffman of Colorado also called for Mr. Trump to be replaced. The sharply worded statements showed both the outrage within the party<U+00A0>and the recognition of the damage to the GOP<U+2019>s effort to gain ground<U+00A0>among women, many of whom were already turned off by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s past<U+00A0>comments. The presidential nominee<U+2019>s surrogates on Capitol Hill had<U+00A0>insisted he would be able to make up any gender gap, and the<U+00A0>Trump campaign had dispatched his daughter Ivanka to meet with female<U+00A0>Republican lawmakers just weeks ago. On Friday afternoon, a decade-old recording emerged in which Mr. Trump spoke in crude sexual terms about women.<U+00A0>Immediately, Republicans moved to condemn Mr. Trump<U+2019>s language.<U+00A0>The rebukes came from every corner of the Republican party<U+2014>from Mr.<U+00A0>Trump<U+2019>s opponents in the presidential primary, from the party<U+00A0>leadership, from Senate Republicans in difficult re-election battles.<U+00A0>In each case, the message was similar. <U+201C>It is never appropriate to condone unwanted sexual advances or<U+00A0>violence against women,<U+201D> said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.),<U+00A0>the highest ranking Republican woman in the House. <U+201C>Mr. Trump must<U+00A0>realize that it has no place in public or private conversations today<U+00A0>or in the past.<U+201D> <U+201C>These comments are repugnant, and unacceptable in any circumstance,<U+201D><U+00A0>said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). <U+201C>As the father<U+00A0>of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize<U+00A0>directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility<U+00A0>for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that<U+00A0>tape.<U+201D> <U+201C>Donald Trump<U+2019>s comments were outrageous and unacceptable,<U+201D> Sen. Pat<U+00A0>Toomey (R., Pa.), currently locked in a tight re-election battle, said in a posting on Twitter. <U+201C>There are no excuses for Donald Trump<U+2019>s offensive and demeaning<U+00A0>comments,<U+201D> Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) said in a statement. <U+201C>No woman<U+00A0>should ever be victimized by this kind of inappropriate behavior. He<U+00A0>alone bears the burden of his conduct and alone should suffer the<U+00A0>consequences.<U+201D> Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah withdrew his endorsement late Friday. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m out,<U+201D> he said in an interview with the Fox 13 television station in Salt Lake City.<U+00A0><U+201C>I can no longer in good conscience endorse this person for<U+00A0>president. It is some of the most abhorrent and offensive comments<U+00A0>that you can possibly imagine.<U+201D> Other Utahns took similar steps. Gary Herbert, the Republican governor of Utah, also rescinded his<U+00A0>endorsement, writing on Twitter: <U+201C>Donald Trump<U+2019>s statements are beyond<U+00A0>offensive & despicable. While I cannot vote for Hillary Clinton, I<U+00A0>will not vote for Trump.<U+201D> Former<U+00A0>Utah Gov. John Huntsman, who briefly ran for president in 2012, and<U+00A0>had endorsed Mr. Trump, told the Salt Lake Tribune: <U+201C>The time has come<U+00A0>for Gov. Pence to lead the ticket.<U+201D> It wasn<U+2019>t the first time that Republicans have been prompted to<U+00A0>denounce Mr. Trump<U+2019>s comments, such as when he called for banning<U+00A0>Muslims from entering the country and when the Republican nominee<U+00A0>criticized the family of a Muslim officer who died while serving in<U+00A0>Iraq. But in their intensity and number, the repudiations of Mr.<U+00A0>Trump<U+2019>s remarks stood out. <U+201C>These comments are disturbing and inappropriate,<U+201D> said Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), who had only recently agreed to endorse Mr. Trump, wrote<U+00A0>on Twitter. <U+201C>There is simply no excuse for them.<U+201D> <U+201C>As the grandfather of two precious girls, I find that no apology can<U+00A0>excuse away Donald Trump<U+2019>s reprehensible comments degrading women,<U+201D><U+00A0>wrote Jeb Bush, a former GOP presidential candidate who was a frequent<U+00A0>target of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s. <U+201C>Donald<U+2019>s comments were vulgar, egregious & impossible to justify,<U+201D><U+00A0>wrote Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.). <U+201C>No one should ever talk about any<U+00A0>woman in those terms, even in private.<U+201D> Democrats noted that many Republicans stopped short of withdrawing<U+00A0>their support of Mr. Trump or calling on him to drop out of the race. <U+201C>This is who Donald Trump is, and it is just the latest reminder of<U+00A0>why he is unfit for the presidency,<U+201D> Democratic National Committee<U+00A0>Chairwoman Donna Brazile said in a statement. <U+201C>The only remaining<U+00A0>question is whether Republicans will continue to stand by him and call<U+00A0>him a role model for our children.<U+201D> Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com",

Two differing approaches to historical memory are on display. Both create their own historical distortions. By eradicating monuments of an entire era, one paints that era as bad in every single way. By sanctifying an autocratic ruler, the other whitewashes the imperfections of the past. \nAccording to the Ukrainian television station Espreso TV , the last remaining statue of Lenin in Ukraine, located in the town of Novgorod-Severskii, has been taken down. There were once more than 2,000 Lenin statues in the country. As a result of a 2015 law prohibiting communist memorials and symbols, Ukraine is now Lenin-free. \nMeanwhile, a bell-tower dedicated to Russia<U+2019>s last Tsar, Nicholas II, was formally opened in the Crimean capital, Simferopol, on Tuesday. Attending the opening was Duma deputy and former chief prosecutor of Crimea Natalia Poklonskaia, who has acquired something of a reputation as a monarchist, and whose idea the bell tower was. Poklonskaia told reporters that, <U+2018>For me, my colleagues and friends, this isn<U+2019>t simply a bell tower, but an entire church. And this church is not simply a building but a holy one, in which will be carried out, with full rights, all the services and liturgies as laid down in the church canons.<U+2019> \nThe first story illustrates an approach to historical memory which is destructive and coercive; the second an approach which is constructive and voluntary. If there is one thing the participants can agree on, it is that they aren<U+2019>t fans of communism. But as these examples show, the victors of today<U+2019>s memory wars aren<U+2019>t always the victors of tomorrow<U+2019>s.",

Speaking via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday, RT reported that Assange claimed the daily email release ritual has <U+201C>whipped up a crazed hornet<U+2019>s nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign<U+201D> leading them to attack WikiLeaks. \n<U+201C>They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile,<U+201D> he added. \nAssange described Ecuador<U+2019>s decision to shut down his internet for the duration of the presidential campaign as a <U+201C>strategic position<U+201D> so that its <U+201C>policy of non-intervention can<U+2019>t be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador.<U+201D> He said he was sympathetic with Ecuador, insisting they face the dilemma of having the US interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the US elections next month. He also said that he did not agree with Ecuador<U+2019>s decision but did understand it. WikiLeaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from Ecuador, he said. \nHe did, however, reject the idea that WikiLeaks is interfering with the US election, claiming, <U+201C>this is not the interference of electoral process, this is the definition of electoral process <U+2013> for media organizations and, in fact, everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring. It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform.<U+201D> It will, of course, be spun as interference if Hillary were to lose as the tables would then be turned, and instead of Trump slamming the <U+201C>rigged<U+201D> elections, it will be Hillary who will demand a pound of flesh, perhaps literally. \nAssange did not stop there and also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being <U+201C>controlled by Clinton supporters.<U+201D> If there is anything the Podesta emails have revealed, it is that he is correct in his assessment .",

Two audience members told DailyMail.com that they had seen the man holding a firearm. That has not been confirmed by law enforcement. As police and good Samaritans took him down, the crowd surged backward and strained against the press section. <U+2018>CNN sucks!<U+2019> one man yelled. <U+2018>You people caused this!<U+2019> Audience members at the front of the crowd reportedly said they saw the man raise up a sign before a scuffle ensued.

In March a man leaped over a police barricade during a Trump rally at an airport hangar in Dayton, Ohio. The man,Thomas Dimassimo, was charged with disorderly conduct and inciting panic, but he never reached the stage. Secret Service tackled him when he was still several yards away from the candidate. <U+2018>I was ready for him, but it<U+2019>s much easier if the cops do it, don<U+2019>t we agree?<U+2019> Trump said at the time. <U+2018>And to think I had such an easy life!

He has finally decided to come forward and break silence on his experience, but for the some reason the Clinton<U+2019>s have refused to deny a thing that he says. Even more shocking is when you take a closer look at Hillary<U+2019>s ex-lover, it appears that he was shot in the head and Hillary<U+2019>s odd behavior is having many claim murder. \nMany of those paying close attention to the Clintons<U+2019> suspicious dealings and sketchy behavior over the years have long since thought that longtime ally and lawyer Vince Foster was indeed having an affair with the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Well, Clinton<U+2019>s fixer, Jeff Rovin, just confirmed these suspicions. \nRovin admitted to Sean Hannity, on the record, that Hillary Clinton and Foster had indeed been having an affair for many years. \nThis is especially interesting when we analyze the questionable circumstances of Foster<U+2019>s death that was ruled as a suicide. Foster died of a gunshot wound to the head and a great deal of people who have analyzed the facts strongly believe that it was not a suicide at all, but rather murder. \nRovin proceeded to run down this road without intending to when he described Hillary<U+2019>s reaction to Foster<U+2019>s death: \nHe [Rovin] claimed to have helped scrub the office of Vince Foster to snatch documents related to the Whitewater scandal and covered up an alleged affair between Hillary and Foster. But Rovin told Hannity he was tasked with distracting the media while Hillary<U+2019>s crew rummaged through Foster<U+2019>s office. He also called the Hillary-Foster affair <U+201C>pretty much an open secret.<U+201D> \nIt just seems too close to be coincidence.

Back then, he wrote, it was the rock stars who filled the tabloids with their sex and excess. By contrast the British royals, raised on noblesse oblige, largely limited their public appearances to celebrations on behalf of hospitals, schools and other worthy causes. The roles are now reversed. These days it is the British royals caught exiting nightclubs in the wee hours of the morning or captured playing naked billiards. By contrast, knighted rock stars emerge periodically from their landed estates to offer polite statements on the environment. Something of the same has just happened this side of the Atlantic. At least since his victory speech promising to be president for all Americans<U+2014>and notwithstanding the occasional tweet deriding <U+201C>Saturday Night Live<U+201D> as <U+201C>nothing funny<U+201D> or the New York Times as <U+201C>failing<U+201D><U+2014>Mr. Trump has mostly tried to sound positive and inclusive. Meanwhile, those who spent the 2016 campaign decrying Mr. Trump for his temperament and fascist tendencies are now exhibiting precisely those traits. The most recent outburst came Friday night, when Mike Pence and some of his family took in a performance of the Broadway hit <U+201C>Hamilton.<U+201D> Having entered the theater to a mixture of cheers and boos, the vice president-elect at the end of the performance found himself lectured from the stage by the cast. Lin-Manuel Miranda, who both wrote the musical and starred in it, tweeted that he was <U+201C>proud<U+201D> of the moment, which he characterized as <U+201C>leading with love.<U+201D> As Mr. Pence pointed out, cast members have a right to say what they please. But the rest of us likewise have a right to note how boorish and self-congratulatory they were. Then there are the CEOs such as GrubHub <U+2019>s Matt Maloney, who sent out an email to employees suggesting that those who agreed with the president-elect should resign. Mr. Maloney later backtracked, denying that his line about <U+201C>you have no place here<U+201D> was aimed at Trump supporters. Plainly the markets thought otherwise: His stock took a beating. He wasn<U+2019>t the only CEO with, uh, a temperament not suited for the job. Another CEO has been sacked for making death threats against Mr. Trump on social media. Meanwhile, Sophie Theallet, who runs her own fashion label, released a statement declaring that, such is her opposition to discrimination, she will never make a dress for the new First Lady, Melania Trump. <U+201C>I encourage my fellow designers to do the same,<U+201D> Ms. Theallet says, right after a line calling for <U+201C>respect for all lifestyles.<U+201D> In short, since the election many in the anti-Trump crowd are finding their inner Donald. One result is the spectacle of a press corps that abandoned even the pretense of objectivity during the campaign behaving as though the president-elect<U+2019>s decision to have a steak dinner without telling them<U+2014>at a very public restaurant<U+2014>portends some kind of constitutional crisis. The rest of the coverage isn<U+2019>t much better. Consider a recent story from Politico headlined <U+201C>Trump lashes out at accusations of transition chaos.<U+201D> The evidence for <U+201C>lashing out<U+201D>? A tweet in which Mr. Trump said <U+201C>It is going so smoothly.<U+201D> Yet it<U+2019>s unfair to single out Politico. If you want to get a good picture of what a herd of independent minds looks like, just plug <U+201C>Trump lashes out<U+201D> or <U+201C>Trump lashing out<U+201D> into Google News. Not to mention the other great switcheroo of 2016: on political violence and acceptance of the election results. Throughout the campaign, America was routinely warned that Mr. Trump was the second coming of Hitler. So how is it that since the election the actual brownshirts<U+2014>folks who go around beating up others for their views<U+2014>so often turn out to be targeting Trump supporters? Or that thousands of protesters are today marching around with signs proclaiming their refusal to acknowledge Mr. Trump as the legitimately elected president? Since Election Day Americans have seen the trashing of cars and shops that now constitute modern expressions of tolerance. In addition, the flesh-and-blood victims of the Love Trumps Hate beatdowns include a 15-year-old high-school student wearing a <U+201C>Make America Great Again<U+201D> hat in Rockville, Md., a 49-year-old Chicago man dragged out of his car, and a 21-year-old Arab-American university student chased down and hit from behind at a Black Lives Matter rally in El Cajon, Calif. All the while, the president-elect continues his Twitter <U+201C>rants.<U+201D> Here are a few of the most recent: <U+201C>I have always had a good relationship with Chuck Schumer.

She presented her ability to survive 4-and-a-half hours on a stage with Donald Trump as proof of sufficient stamina to serve as commander-in-chief. \n<U+201C>She evidently intended this as a joke, although I suspect our combat veterans would not be amused,<U+201D> states AAPS executive director Jane Orient, M.D. \nVideos are, however, circulating on the internet, from her rather brief and rare appearances in public, which are purported to show pathological eye movements. \n<U+201C>These are quick, episodic, and inconsistent,<U+201D> states Dr. Orient, who is an internist. <U+201C>So we decided to ask doctors on our email list to have a look at one of the videos . A helpful tool is to paste the URL into http://RowVid.com and watch it at half or quarter speed.<U+201D> \nNearly two-thirds of respondents said they saw abnormal movements. Only 15% did not, and 21% were unsure. There are long segments in which the eye movements appear normal. \nAbout 60% of those who saw abnormal movements thought <U+201C>the cause could be a potentially disabling neurological condition,<U+201D> and none of them were willing to say that it isn<U+2019>t. \nSuch movements signify an abnormality in portions of the brain that coordinate the eye muscles. There is a long differential diagnosis. Possibilities the respondents suggested include increased intracranial pressure (she is at risk for that because of her history of head trauma and a transverse sinus clot); a drug effect; or a chronic degenerative neurological condition. Parkinson<U+2019>s disease is mentioned<U+2014>with drug treatment concealing most manifestations but causing the eye signs. \nDoctors were asked which tests would be helpful, and 37 responded . The most common one was a full neurological examination by unbiased specialists, including a neuro-ophthalmologist. \n<U+201C>A neuro-ophthalmologist could do a structured examination, but it might be normal at a moment in time. The video clips need to be explained,<U+201D> stated Dr. Orient. <U+201C>A cardiologist might do an electrocardiogram that is perfectly normal<U+2014>but he will also look at a 24-hour monitor that may show a transient life-threatening rhythm disturbance.<U+201D> \nA collection of additional clips in slow motion has been posted. \n<U+201C>As Hillary revealed to the public, perhaps illegally, the President may have only four minutes to respond to a nuclear threat,<U+201D> said Dr. Orient. <U+201C>The public needs to know whether she is concealing a serious, progressive illness that may impair memory, reasoning, alertness, or ability to think quickly at a critical time.<U+201D> \nThe Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) is a national organization representing physicians in virtually all specialties and every state.

But as the students checked out presentations from colleges ranging from the State University of New York at Binghamton to Abilene Christian University in Texas, several expressed concerns about going to America under a Donald J. Trump administration. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s the main topic of conversation among my friends,<U+201D> said Palak Gera, 21, who is applying to graduate programs in pharmaceutical science in North Carolina, Illinois and North Dakota. <U+201C>They don<U+2019>t want to apply to the U.S. under Trump.<U+201D> Aman Kumar, 18, who is looking at universities in California, said, <U+201C>In his campaign, he<U+2019>s discriminating against Muslim and other brown and black people,<U+201D> adding, <U+201C>I<U+2019>m thinking of applying to Canada.<U+201D> This year, the number of international students in United States colleges surpassed one million for the first time, bringing more than $32 billion a year into the economy and infusions of money to financially struggling colleges. College admissions officials in the United States caution that it is too early to draw firm conclusions about overseas applications, because deadlines for applications are generally in January and February. But they are worried that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election as president could portend a drop in international candidates. Canadian universities have already detected a postelection surge in interest from overseas. <U+201C>We have seen an increase in applications from the U.S. and from international students in the last week,<U+201D> Jocelyne Younan, the director of global undergraduate recruitment at McGill University in Montreal, wrote in an email. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve also seen an increase in students inquiring about McGill on social media.<U+201D> Traffic on a University of Toronto website for international applicants surged the day after the election, officials there said <U+2014> and most of it came from Americans. <U+201C>Visits to our recruitment website from the U.S. are typically around 1,000 a day,<U+201D> said Ted Sargent, the university<U+2019>s vice president, international. <U+201C>On Nov. 9, that spiked to 10,000.<U+201D> On the same day, there was an increase in visitors from Britain and India, Mr. Sargent said. <U+201C>Our positive message as a university, but also as a city and a country, definitely is about openness to people from around the world and a real inclusiveness,<U+201D> he said. A disruption in the flow of international students could be particularly worrisome for universities that balance their books with income from international students, who generally pay higher tuition. At Indiana State University, 1,000 of the 13,500 students are foreign, including many Saudis who transferred this year from Idaho State, and officials are concerned, said Santhana Naidu, an associate vice president for communications and marketing. <U+201C>We have already received inquiries from prospective students who are in the applicant pool,<U+201D> Mr. Naidu said. <U+201C>They<U+2019>re asking, <U+2018>Is it safe for me to come there?<U+2019> and generally getting the lay of the land.<U+201D> Mr. Naidu will be among officials meeting this week at the university, in Terre Haute, to determine what they can do to assuage fears. Scott Manning, the director of global programs at Susquehanna University, a liberal arts college in Selinsgrove, Pa., said he had heard before the election that two prospective students from China were waiting until after the vote to submit visa documents necessary to attend Susquehanna. <U+201C>They were kind of spooked about threats Trump made about the South China Sea, back and forth with Japan about some uninhabited islands, and trade issues in general,<U+201D> Mr. Manning said. The students, who were considering an English-language program beginning in January as a precursor to fall enrollment, have still not submitted their documents, he said. Officials at Ohio State University said it was too early to tell whether the election result would affect international applications, adding that there had been an increase so far this year, although most were received before Election Day. International study has historically been affected by social forces. Attacks on Indian students in Australia in 2009 and 2010 were believed to be part of the reason for a sharp drop-off in applications from India. International education experts first raised concerns in May about the election of Mr. Trump, when a study was presented at a meeting of Nafsa: Association of International Educators indicating that a Trump presidency could dissuade international students from coming to the United States. The study, by Intead and FPP EDU Media, two companies specializing in international student recruitment for colleges, found that 60 percent of international prospective students would be less likely to attend a college in the United States if Mr. Trump were elected. <U+201C>We were really surprised, if not shocked, by the results,<U+201D> said Benjamin Waxman, the chief executive of Intead. More recently, international education experts who have been in China and India <U+2014> the two biggest feeder countries to American colleges <U+2014> also said they were seeing postelection jitters. Andrew Chen, the chief development officer at WholeRen, an international education consulting company in Pittsburgh, returned to the United States this week from China, where, he said, colleges in other countries were trying to capitalize on fears over Mr. Trump. <U+201C>Many organizations and programs are starting to use this to promote education in the U.K., Australia and Singapore,<U+201D> Mr. Chen said. <U+201C>These competitors paint the U.S. as not safe. Now, with Trump, they<U+2019>re saying it<U+2019>s going to be unfriendly.<U+201D> But Mr. Chen said he believed the fears of international students were unfounded. <U+201C>He doesn<U+2019>t like refugees from the Middle East, and he said for all Muslims he wanted to do a background check,<U+201D> Mr. Chen said. <U+201C>And also people from Mexico. He doesn<U+2019>t like those people.<U+201D> Mr. Chen added, <U+201C>But I don<U+2019>t think he ever said he doesn<U+2019>t like international students who pay tuition to study in the U.S.<U+201D> Rahul Choudaha, an international education consultant in New Jersey, has been traveling for the past week in India, where he said there was a palpable worry among students and their parents. <U+201C>They are not seeing the United States as a safe destination,<U+201D> said Mr. Choudaha, a founder of interEdge, a company that helps international students. <U+201C>They<U+2019>re changing the destination to Australia or Singapore.<U+201D> <U+201C>It<U+2019>s an anti-immigrant tone,<U+201D> he added. <U+201C>Just stylistically, he seems to be a very different person than people thought would be taking leadership in America.<U+201D> As she prepared her applications to prestigious American universities, Naina Lavakare, a senior at the British School in New Delhi, developed a Plan B. <U+201C>It was a family joke,<U+201D> said Ms. Lavakare<U+2019>s mother, Jyoti Pande. <U+201C>You can apply anywhere you want. However, if it<U+2019>s Trump in the White House, we<U+2019>re not sure we want to send you to the U.S.<U+201D> Ms. Lavakare, 17, has adjusted her college aspirations. While she still has several American colleges on her list <U+2014> in New York, California and Rhode Island <U+2014> she dropped universities in <U+201C>red states<U+201D> to focus on colleges in Britain and Canada, her mother said, because she was concerned about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s anti-immigrant talk. Ms. Lavakare and her friends, Ms. Pande said, <U+201C>view Trump as a bigot and a misogynist.<U+201D> She added, <U+201C>I think that is what is freaking them out more than anything else.<U+201D> Nida Najar reported from New Delhi, and Stephanie Saul from New York.

        "input": "time: null \n author: VANESSA FRIEDMAN \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/fashion/hillary-clinton-ralph-lauren.html?_r=0 \n text: Has Hillary Clinton found her dresser in chief? It would appear that way. While the Twitterverse was busy parsing the possible subtexts of Melania Trump<U+2019>s decision to wear a hot pink Gucci pussy-bow blouse to watch her husband, Donald J. Trump, during the second presidential debate Sunday evening (given his recently revealed lewd comments about women from 2005), it was actually what Mrs. Clinton wore that seemed meaningful to me. Specifically, her use of a Ralph Lauren navy wool double-faced pantsuit with a cream shawl collar and cream wool top to better frame the jovial-serenity-atop-policy-wonk approach with which she has chosen to contrast herself with Mr. Trump. See, she also wore Ralph Lauren to the first presidential debate (a red trouser suit), to her speech accepting her party<U+2019>s nomination at the Democratic National Convention ( an ivory suit ), and to her opening campaign rally on Roosevelt Island ( a periwinkle blue suit ). In other words, she has worn Ralph Lauren for most of her recent major televised public appearances. If three is a trend, as they say, four would be what? Commitment? A very clear pattern, to say the least. This matters both because of what it means now and what it suggests about how Mrs. Clinton is using clothing to bolster her own narrative, and because of what it means for the future. After all, if she wins the election, it will be up to someone to help craft the image of the first female president of the United States. And thus far, despite the fact that a spokeswoman said the company would not comment on the relationship, evidence is beginning to build that that someone would be Mr. Lauren. After all, during the 2008 campaign, Mrs. Clinton had no clear allegiance to any one designer. And though she has worn other designers over the many months of this campaign (including Giorgio Armani), and though during her time as secretary of state Mrs. Clinton often wore jackets from the designer Nina McLemore, the increasing choice of Mr. Lauren as the current go-to name and the ability of the clothes to flatter the candidate without calling attention to themselves make it very likely that the pattern will continue. Certainly it would make sense, from both a historical and a professional point of view. First ladies from Jacqueline Kennedy (with Oleg Cassini) to Nancy Reagan (with Adolfo) often allied themselves with a single designer, both as a collaborator in shaping the style of the administration, and for simplicity<U+2019>s sake. President Obama said in an interview with Vanity Fair during his first term in office that the fewer decisions he had to make every day, the more he could concentrate on political priorities. And one of the easiest places for anyone to reduce options is in the wardrobe. Put simply, the president has more important things to worry about than clothes. Which doesn<U+2019>t mean they don<U+2019>t matter. Ralph Lauren is an interesting choice for Mrs. Clinton, both aesthetically and strategically. Mr. Lauren is, perhaps, the most ur-American of American designers: a man who built an empire on the mythology of the untrammeled West, where cowboys roamed free among herds of bison, along with a kind of <U+201C>Brideshead Revisited<U+201D> Anglo past. He is a man who takes his bow at the end of his show in cowboy boots and jeans, who owns a ranch with tepees so luxurious they made Oprah Winfrey green with envy when she visited. A man who dresses the United States Olympic team for the opening and closing ceremonies, and who (because he got in trouble, admittedly) is now doing so in Made-in-America stuff. A man who gave $13 million in 1998 for the restoration of the original Star-Spangled Banner . Born in the Bronx, a man who started his career as a tie salesman, he is the stereotypical American success story. He is also Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s peer: He is in his mid-70s and will have experienced many of the same social and political upheavals that she has. What he is not, however, is young, a hyphenate (such as Cuban-American or Asian-American), in need of the publicity, or even a very adventurous designer <U+2014> all hallmarks of the choices made by the current political style-setter in the White House, Michelle Obama. Mrs. Obama has used her public profile to support new American names, to further disseminate the idea of the United States as a melting pot, and to otherwise expand the definition of a first lady. (He is also not <U+2014> duh <U+2014> European, which sounds ridiculous but also distinguishes Mrs. Clinton from Mr. Trump, who favors Brioni suits, and whose wife, Melania, has worn the Italian label Fendi and the British label Roksanda Ilincic while supporting her husband, as well as the aforementioned Gucci.) And though it seems Mr. Lauren is the establishment choice, given both his dominant position in the fashion world and the noncontroversial politesse of his clothes <U+2014> which could be construed as a bad choice for Mrs. Clinton, given the clear desire on the part of so much of the electorate to upend the Washington establishment <U+2014> he has, in fact, never been much of a White House presence (a black dress worn by Mrs. Obama to a British state dinner aside). That honor often went to Oscar de la Renta , who died in 2014 but who had dressed first ladies from Mrs. Kennedy to Laura Bush during his career. A Clinton-Lauren collaboration would have, indubitably, elegant results. She would look, if she does become president, always appropriate. Odds are that the pantsuits would continue but that they would be slightly more tailored than they have been, a bit less like coat-dresses, a little softer. Together, they would not foment sartorial revolution, or shatter the Angela Merkel mold of dressing, or change the parameters of what it means to look like a president. That<U+2019>s probably no bad thing, since the next holder of the executive office will have other eggs to break, and there<U+2019>s no reason to waste political capital on clothes. As a woman, though, I can<U+2019>t help but wish that something a little more radical may happen so that the feminization of power could be clear for all to see, whether they are listening to a speech or just looking at Instagram. And maybe, if Mrs. Clinton is elected, she will decide to cast her sartorial net widely, and experiment. You never know. But either way, if Mrs. Clinton does become president, whoever dresses her will be designing the look of history. That, at least, we know for sure.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its second large gain this week, rising 256.95 points to 18589.69, led by a rally in financial, pharmaceutical and engineering firms. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note surged to 2.07%, its highest level since January. Yields rise when prices fall. The action shows that after months of either playing down the likelihood of a Trump presidency or selling shares in a defensive reflex when Mr. Trump rose in pre-election polls, investors are welcoming the prospect that expansive fiscal spending under the Trump administration could bolster economic activity, push up inflation and support higher bond yields in coming years. A Trump stimulus could be good for stocks and bad for bonds, analysts said, by boosting economic growth that would bolster hiring and corporate earnings while cutting taxes, leading to deepening deficits that tend to be associated with higher interest rates. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election also sent waves through industries deemed likely by investors to be sharply affected by potential changes in government policy. The Republican<U+2019>s victory throws doubt on AT&T Inc. <U+2019>s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Inc. Mr. Trump said in October that he would block the AT&T-Time Warner deal, and that he would try to break up the Comcast Corp. -NBC Universal merger. In both cases, Mr. Trump said the media is controlled by too few people. Shares of AT&T rose 1.2%, while Time Warner shares, which were already trading at a wide discount to AT&T<U+2019>s offer, fell 1.5%. At an investor conference Wednesday, AT&T finance chief John Stephens extended an olive branch. <U+201C>We really look forward to working with President-elect Trump,<U+201D> Mr. Stephens said. <U+201C>His policies and his discussions about infrastructure investment, economic development and American innovation all fit right in with AT&T<U+2019>s goals.<U+201D> Drugmakers and some other firms have been hit hard this year by fears that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would have favored measures to sharply limit drug-price increases. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election should free up a sector that some view as deeply undervalued, said some analysts and investors. <U+201C>The case for health-care stocks is clear cut,<U+201D> said Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance . <U+201C>It has been the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 year to date, and the removal of political risk is a near certainty.<U+201D> While Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election could temporarily trip up the surging mergers-and-acquisitions market, it may ultimately spark an acceleration in deal making, bankers and lawyers said. Some deal makers said they view a Trump victory as a long-term positive. The Obama administration has stepped up scrutiny of mergers and a number of proposed deals have fallen apart in the face of antitrust and other regulatory pressure. Some investors said they weren<U+2019>t sure how seriously to take the prospect of Trump stimulus, saying he has committed only verbally and hasn<U+2019>t released detailed plans or outlined relative priorities. At the same time, many said they believe Mr. Trump views his mandate as centering on restoring U.S. growth after a tepid postcrisis economic expansion that ranks among the slowest ever. Many investors saw evidence Wednesday that the market is already grappling with likely nuances. Mr. Trump has promised to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure projects, a position that was applauded by Caterpillar Inc., which also relies heavily on export markets. Caterpillar shares rose 7.7% Wednesday. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve got a lot to do at home on building our own infrastructure in this country, and we are excited about some of the things that he has said in this regard,<U+201D> said Kathryn Dickey Karol, Caterpillar<U+2019>s vice president for global government and corporate affairs. But Martin Richenhagen, chief executive of farm-equipment maker AGCO Corp. , said he is concerned about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s repeated support for trade protectionism. <U+201C>That would be a nightmare if we make life difficult for imports and exports,<U+201D> said Mr. Richenhagen, who was in Germany this week. AGCO shares rose 0.5%. While his election stands to provide relief to drugmakers worried about the specter of government price limits, it likely will fan fears for hospital operators and some health insurers that the Medicaid expansion in President Barack Obama <U+2019>s health law could get rolled back. That provision had brought those companies more paying customers. Mr. Trump has vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, though many analysts think it is unlikely that all of the ACA<U+2019>s effects would be undone. Mr. Trump also took aim at high drug prices during his campaign, hinting at measures such as reimportation of drugs and giving Medicare powers to negotiate drug prices to limit price rises. J. Mario Molina, CEO of Molina Healthcare Inc., a large insurer of Medicaid patients, expects the new administration to expand Medicaid further. <U+201C>Health-care reform is in place, it<U+2019>s going to be modified, it<U+2019>s going to move forward,<U+201D> he said. Molina shares dropped 16% Wednesday and HCA Holdings Inc., the biggest U.S. hospital company, saw its shares drop 11%. Wednesday<U+2019>s rally came after Mr. Trump<U+2019>s surprise victory spiraled through financial markets overnight Tuesday and into Wednesday morning, sending U.S. stock futures and the dollar sliding and havens such as gold and the Japanese yen soaring. Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner at Meridian Equity Partners, said he arrived at the New York Stock Exchange at 7:15 a.m. and<U+2014>after following a tumultuous night of stock-futures trading<U+2014>was surprised to see indications that the market could open flat or higher. As Mrs. Clinton walked to the podium to give her concession speech at about 11:30 a.m. Eastern time, Mr. Corpina said a hush fell over the NYSE trading floor. He said traders crowded around televisions on the floor and turned up the volume. As Mrs. Clinton delivered remarks, which underscored a smooth transfer of power, the quiet on the floor was punctuated by phone rings and computer beeps announcing client orders. <U+201C>She kept her head high, she said the right things, and that helped with the overall market,<U+201D> Mr. Corpina said. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell as low as 1.720%, according to Tradeweb, but then climbed above 2% for its biggest one-day yield gain since 2013. The decline in bond prices extends a selloff that began this summer after yields in the developed world hit record lows after the U.K.<U+2019>s vote to leave the European Union. Some investors said Wednesday<U+2019>s moves reflect more the manic state of the markets than the impact of potential infrastructure spending, which both candidates had proposed during the campaign. <U+201C>We just priced in too much stimulus too quickly for my liking,<U+201D> said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates. <U+2014>Riva Gold, Dana Mattioli and Ryan Knutson contributed to this article.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Ramzy Baroud \n source: antiwar.com \n text: Share This \nLast July, the Palestinian Authority took the unexpected, although belated step of seeking Arab backing in suing Britain over the Balfour Declaration. That \"declaration\" was the first ever explicit commitment made by Britain, and the West in general, to establish a Jewish homeland atop an existing Palestinian homeland. \nIt is too early to tell whether the Arab League would heed the Palestinian call , or if the PA would even follow through, especially considering that the latter has the habit of making too many proclamations backed by little or no action. \nHowever, it seems that the next year will witness a significant tug of war regarding the Balfour Declaration, the 100 th anniversary of which will be commemorated on November 02, 2017. \nBut who is Balfour, what is the Balfour Declaration and why does all of this matters today? \nBritain<U+2019>s Foreign Secretary from late 1916, Arthur James Balfour, had pledged Palestine to another people. That promise was made on November 02, 1917 on behalf of the British government in the form of a letter sent to the leader of the Jewish community in Britain, Walter Rothschild. \nAt the time, Britain was not even in control of Palestine, which was still part of the Ottoman Empire. Either way, Palestine was never Balfour<U+2019>s to so casually transfer to anyone else. His letter read: \n\"His Majesty<U+2019>s government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.\" \nHe concluded, \"I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation.\" \nBalfour was hardly acting on his own. True, the Declaration bears his name, yet, in reality, he was a loyal agent of an Empire with massive geopolitical designs, not only concerning Palestine alone, but with Palestine as part of a larger Arab landscape. \nOnly a year earlier, another sinister document was introduced, albeit secretly. It was endorsed by another top British diplomat, Mark Sykes and, on behalf of France, by Fran<U+00E7>ois Georges-Picot. The Russians were informed of the agreement, as they too had received a piece of the Ottoman cake. \nThe document indicated that, once the Ottomans were soundly defeated, their territories, including Palestine, would be split among the prospective victorious parties. \nThe Sykes-Picot Agreement , also known as the \"Asia Minor Agreement\", was signed in secret one hundred years ago, two years into World War I. It signified the brutal nature of colonial powers that rarely associated land and resources with people who lived upon or owned them. \nThe centerpiece of the agreement was a map that was marked with straight lines by a China graph pencil. The map largely determined the fate of the Arabs, dividing them in accordance with various haphazard assumptions of tribal and sectarian lines. \nThe improvised map consisted not only of lines but also colors , along with language that attested to the fact that the two countries viewed the Arab region purely on materialistic terms, without paying the slightest attention to the possible repercussions of slicing up entire civilizations with a multifarious history of cooperation and conflict. \nThe Sykes-Picot negotiations were completed in March 1916 and, although official, was secretly signed on May 19, 1916. \nWWI concluded on November 11, 1918, after which the division of the Ottoman Empire began in earnest. \nBritish and French mandates were extended over divided Arab entities, while Palestine was granted to the Zionist movement a year later, when Balfour conveyed the British government<U+2019>s promise, sealing the fate of Palestinians to a life of perpetual war and turmoil. \nRarely was British-Western hypocrisy and complete disregard for the national aspiration of any other nation on full display as in the case of Palestine. Beginning with the first wave of Zionist Jewish migration to Palestine in 1882, European countries helped facilitate the movement of illegal settlers and resources, where the establishment of many colonies, large and small, was afoot. \nSo when Balfour sent his letter to Rothschild, the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine was very much plausible. \nStill, many supercilious promises were being made to the Arabs during the Great War years, as the Arab leadership sided with the British in their war against the Ottoman Empire. Arabs were promised instant independence, including that of the Palestinians. \nWhen the intentions of the British and their rapport with the Zionists became too apparent, Palestinians rebelled , marking a rebellion that has never ceased 99 years later, and highlighting the horrific consequences of British colonialism and the eventual complete Zionist takeover of Palestine which is still felt after all of these years. \nPaltry attempts to pacify Palestinian anger were to no avail, especially after the League of Nations Council in July 1922 approved the terms of the British Mandate over Palestine <U+2013> which was originally granted to Britain in April 1920 <U+2013> without consulting the Palestinians at all. In fact, Palestinians would disappear from the British and international radar, only to reappear as negligible rioters, troublemakers, and obstacles to the joint British-Zionist colonial concoctions. \nDespite occasional assurances to the contrary, the British intention of ensuring the establishment of an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine was becoming clearer with time. The Balfour Declaration was not merely an aberration, but had, indeed, set the stage for the full-scale ethnic cleansing that followed, three decades later. \nIn fact, that history remains in constant replay: the Zionists claimed Palestine and renamed it \"Israel\"; the British continue to support them, although never ceasing to pay lip-service to the Arabs; and the Palestinian people remain a nation that is geographically fragmented between refugee camps, in the Diaspora, militarily occupied, or treated as second class citizens in a country upon which their ancestors dwelt since time immemorial. \nWhile Balfour cannot be blamed for all the misfortunates that have befallen Palestinians since he communicated his brief, but infamous letter, the notion that his \"promise\" embodied <U+2013> that of complete disregard of the aspirations and rights of the Palestinian Arab people <U+2013> that very letter is handed from one generation of British diplomats to the next, in the same way that Palestinian resistance to colonialism has and continues to spread across generations. \nThat injustice continues, thus the perpetuation of the conflict. What the British, the early Zionists, the Americans and subsequent Israeli governments failed to understand, and continue to ignore at their own peril, is that there can be no peace without justice and equality in Palestine; and that Palestinians will continue to resist, as long as the reasons that inspired their rebellion nearly a century ago, remain in place. \nRamzy Baroud ( www.ramzybaroud.net ) is a media consultant, an internationally-syndicated columnist and the editor of PalestineChronicle.com .

        "input": "time: null \n author: Ian Talley \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-tones-down-criticism-of-china-other-trading-partners-in-new-currency-report-1476475201 \n text: WASHINGTON<U+2014>The U.S. Treasury Department sharply toned down its criticism of China and other Asian export giants in its latest currency report to Congress on Friday, an assessment in stark contrast to the heated election-year rhetoric targeting Beijing<U+2019>s exchange-rate policy as a central threat to the U.S. economy. Treasury said authorities in China, Japan and Korea have resisted the temptation to use their currencies to gain a stronger export advantage, a marked turnaround from recent years and the fruits of a successful global campaign. Preserving a two-decade precedent, no country was named a currency manipulator. <U+201C>Treasury has been working aggressively to address exchange-rate issues,<U+201D> the department said in its biannual report. <U+201C>This strategy has produced results.<U+201D> Fred Bergsten, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who was long a critic of China<U+2019>s currency policy, said it is too early for the administration to declare victory. <U+201C>But I do think that a new set of currency-policy norms<U+2014>almost cultural norms<U+2014>have evolved amid a steady drumbeat against currency intervention,<U+201D> Mr. Bergsten said. The administration<U+2019>s trumpeting of its financial diplomacy runs counter to the narrative propounded by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump . Capitalizing on the economic pain that China<U+2019>s rise and past currency manipulation caused over the past two decades, Mr. Trump has said he would slap China with a slew of tariffs in retaliation for Beijing<U+2019>s trade and exchange-rate policies. Fighting currency manipulation has been a priority for the administration because cheaper exchange rates undermine U.S. exports. The country<U+2019>s economic expansion has been weighed down by a strong dollar in part because the U.S. is a haven in a world of weak and shaky growth. But China<U+2019>s steady appreciation of the yuan over the past decade has pushed it to levels the International Monetary Fund say are roughly in line with market fundamentals. Beijing is slowly making its currency a market-determined exchange rate, in part to gain elite, international-reserve status . And though the yuan has fallen over the past year against the dollar as its economy slows faster than expected, Chinese officials have spent more than a half-trillion dollars over the past year to prevent the currency from depreciating faster and further. Similarly, officials in Tokyo have resisted strengthening domestic calls to intervene in the yen as investors buy the currency to higher and higher levels. And Korea, which has repeatedly intervened in its currency in the past, has kept the won from falling over the past year, <U+201C>representing a shift from several years of asymmetric intervention,<U+201D> the Treasury Department said. Instead of using the threat of trade sanctions to whip currency offenders into compliance, Treasury has instead sought to build international peer pressure and leverage its financial diplomacy against damaging exchange-rate policies. That has become more important as other trade irritants between the U.S. and China have moved more to the fore and as it tries to negotiate a pan-Pacific trade deal. <U+201C>It has become much more difficult for any major economy to act unilaterally to depress its currency,<U+201D> said Ted Truman, a former senior financial diplomat at the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve. For Japan to intervene now, for example, <U+201C>the hurdle is now very high<U+201D> after Tokyo signed numerous commitments against intervention and has refrained from action for nearly five years. To be sure, Treasury is still critical of the six countries named in its new <U+201C>monitoring list<U+201D> of potential currency offenders. <U+201C>More transparency over exchange rate management and goals<U+201D> and strong adherence to its international commitments on currency policies <U+201C>will enhance the credibility of China<U+2019>s exchange rate regime,<U+201D> the department said. The administration once again chastised Germany for relying too much on exports to juice growth and not using its budget to juice anemic growth in the eurozone. Europe<U+2019>s powerhouse now has the world<U+2019>s largest trade surplus in dollar terms. Japan should overhaul its economy to alleviate the burden on monetary policy to revive its long-dormant economy, it said. South Korea needs to be more transparent about its exchange rate operations, Treasury said. Switzerland joined Taiwan as economic anomalies that meet some of Treasury<U+2019>s criteria for its name-and-shame list, but aren<U+2019>t countries with currency policies that are a threat to American growth. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew also has said repeatedly that the true test of whether China is moving toward a market-determined exchange rate is whether Beijing allows the currency to appreciate when market pressures reverse. Some economists say the test may come sooner. Many analysts say if growth looks to falter further in China, Beijing could give in to the political pressures to allow a stronger depreciation of the yuan. China<U+2019>s exports suffered a 10% year-over-year fall in September, reviving some of those concerns. But so far, the yuan<U+2019>s fall against the dollar reflects more the greenback<U+2019>s strengthening and Beijing<U+2019>s decision to allow the currency to track a basket of other currencies more closely.

McCaskill Jack Shafer \n source: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/stein-moves-for-pennsylvania-recount-231882 \n text: \"The Stein recount effort is mobilizing concerned voters across Pennsylvania to request recounts in their precincts,\" Jill Stein's campaign said. | Getty By Daniel Strauss 11/28/16 05:06 PM EST Updated 11/28/16 05:05 PM EST Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein is taking steps to initiate a recount in Pennsylvania, three days after filing for a recount in Wisconsin. Recount requests were filed Monday in more than 100 Pennsylvania precincts, according to her campaign. \"The Stein recount effort is mobilizing concerned voters across Pennsylvania to request recounts in their precincts,\" Stein campaign manager David Cobb said in a statement. \"Additionally, the campaign filed a legal petition in state court today on behalf of 100 Pennsylvania voters to protect their right to substantively contest the election in Pennsylvania beyond the recounts being filed by voters at the precinct level. This petition will allow the campaign to pursue a full statewide recount in Pennsylvania if precinct-level recounts uncover any irregularities or tampering.<U+201D> Story Continued Below Stein campaign lawyer Lawrence Otter announced Monday that he filed a lawsuit arguing for a statewide recount of the Nov. 8 presidential election results. The suit, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO, argues that a recount is warranted based on \"grave concerns\" by the more than 100 petitioners involved in the lawsuit \"about the integrity of electronic voting machines used in their districts.\" To initiate a statewide recount through the courts, the Stein campaign must sufficiently prove that there was a strong probability of election fraud in Pennsylvania. But with that high bar for the Stein campaign to meet, the campaign is also hoping to initiate a recount through another route, with Pennsylvania voters in every precinct submitting affidavits to their precinct clerks asking for recounts in their respective precincts. So far, the Stein campaign said, they had successfully gotten 100 precincts to make the requests <U+2014> a fraction of the necessary 9,163 voting precincts. Further complicating the effort, the Pennsylvania Department of State noted that some of the precincts are in counties that had finished certifying their election results, closing the five-day window for petitioning precincts to hold recounts. By Nolan D. McCaskill \"The Department of State is working to gather information from the 67 counties regarding their progress in certifying election returns. We<U+2019>ve learned that many counties have completed their certification, thereby closing the 5-day window to petition at the county level for a recount,\" the Department of State said in a statement on Monday. <U+201C>The Department of State is also providing guidance to the counties on the process for handling recount petitions. We are aware of petitions filed in Berks, Bucks, Centre, Montgomery, and Philadelphia. However, we are not aware of how many have been filed in each county. We have been working to gather that information from the counties. Because the Department is not the filing agency, we are relying on reports from the counties.<U+201D> Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Rob Gleason dismissed Stein's Pennsylvania effort as an act of desperation. <U+201C>Our General Counsel has reviewed the Election Contest and said it is totally and completely without any merit. It does not even allege any facts to support its wild claim that the <U+2018>discontinuity<U+2019> of pre-election polls reported by the media showing that Hillary Clinton would win and the actual results could only have occurred through computer hacking originated by a foreign government,\" Gleason said. <U+201C>This desperate act by Jill Stein and those supporting her is a sad commentary on the failure of some to accept the results of the will of the people as reflected by their votes.<U+201D> The Pennsylvania action follows Stein's initiation of the recount process in Wisconsin, where her campaign filed just before the state's 5 p.m. deadline Friday. Stein had promised supporters that if she raised enough money to pay for additional recounts, her campaign would also file for similar action in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Hillary Clinton's top campaign lawyer said Saturday that the Democratic nominee's campaign would participate in the Wisconsin recount initiated by Stein, and would follow a similar approach in Michigan and Pennsylvania if she pursued recounts in those states. In Wisconsin, Trump<U+2019>s margin of victory is just over 22,000 votes. And in Pennsylvania, it's even larger <U+2014> roughly 71,000 votes. In Michigan, Stein has hired former state Democratic Party chairman Mark Brewer and has until Wednesday to request a formal recount, which is estimated to cost nearly $800,000.

        "input": "time: null \n author: US Marine Fighting Tyranny \n source: fromthetrenchesworldreport.com \n text: New York Times <U+2013> by Mike Isaac SAN FRANCISCO <U+2014> The futurists of Silicon Valley may not have seen this one coming: The first commercial delivery made by a self-driving truck was 2,000 cases of Budweiser beer. On Tuesday, Otto , the Uber-owned self-driving vehicle operation, announced the completion of its first commercial delivery, having delivered its beer load from Fort Collins, Colo., to Colorado Springs, a roughly 120-mile trip on Interstate 25. In recent years, Uber has predicted a future in which you can ride in a self-driving car that will take you where you want to go, no driver necessary. But the idea that commercial trucking could be done by robot is a relatively new idea <U+2014> and a potentially controversial one, given the possibility that robots could one day replace human drivers. <U+201C>We think this technology is inching closer to commercial availability,<U+201D> Lior Ron, co-founder of Otto, said in an interview. In August, Uber acquired Otto, a San Francisco start-up run by a number of veterans of Google<U+2019>s long-running autonomous vehicle research. Though largely symbolic, the beer delivery marks the first commercial partnership for Otto, which was founded less than a year ago. Terms of the deal between Otto and Anheuser-Busch InBev , which owns the Budweiser brand, were not disclosed. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve tested with trailers, of course, but there<U+2019>s nothing like actually doing the real thing, end to end,<U+201D> Mr. Ron said. The delivery was indicative of Uber<U+2019>s larger ambitions to become an enormous transportation network, one in which the company is responsible for moving anything, like people, hot meals or cases of beer, around the globe, at all hours and as efficiently as possible. Travis Kalanick, Uber<U+2019>s chief executive, has said he envisions a future in which transportation will occur in different ways, using both manned and unmanned vehicles. Otto is a particularly large bet for Uber, which paid nearly $700 million for the start-up only a few months after the company started publicly discussing its self-driving-truck ambitions. Since backing down from its money-burning effort to dominate the Chinese ride-hailing market in August, Uber has invested more time and resources to focus on breaking into the trucking market. Annual trucking industry revenue topped $720 billion in 2015, according to American Trucking Association estimates. A good part of that total came from top brands that rely heavily on the trucking industry to transport their goods. Anheuser-Busch, for example, delivers more than a million truckloads of beer domestically every year. <U+201C>We view self-driving trucks as the future, and we want to be a part of that,<U+201D> said James Sembrot, senior director of logistics strategy at Anheuser-Busch. Though the delivery went smoothly, the two companies did not indicate whether there would be any further deals. For this initial delivery, Otto<U+2019>s truck departed Anheuser-Busch<U+2019>s facility in Loveland, Colo., in the early morning before reaching the interstate in Fort Collins. The truck drove through Denver <U+2014> alongside regular passenger car traffic <U+2014> and navigated to its destination in Colorado Springs without incident. Otto said a trained driver was in the cabin of the truck at all times to monitor the vehicle<U+2019>s progress and take over if necessary. At no point was the driver required to intervene, the company said. Future expansion of the pilot program will allow Otto to test for more types of road and weather conditions, a major factor in autonomous vehicle route plotting.",

While Trump won a resounding victory in the electoral college, he was actually bested in the popular vote by Hillary Clinton, who won populous states like California, New York and Illinois by wide margins. And while Democrats have been, to varying degrees, conciliatory in the days since Trump<U+2019>s victory, some have been quick to needle him with the fact that more Americans actually voted for his opponent. Story Continued Below That argument, that Trump would have lost if not for the intricacies of the Electoral College, does not hold water, according to the Manhattan billionaire. <U+201C>If the election were based on total popular vote, I would have campaigned in N.Y., Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily,<U+201D> he wrote on Twitter. The president-elect easily cleared the 270 vote threshold in the Electoral College with wins swing states like Ohio, Florida and North Carolina as well as in traditionally blue states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But as of Tuesday morning, he still trailed his Democratic opponent in the popular vote, 61,845,761 to 60,882,946, a margin of 962,815 votes. Trump lost California by nearly 3 million votes and New York by just over 1.5 million votes. Those two states last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 1988 and 1984, respectively. Minutes after his first tweet Tuesday morning, Trump added another, writing that <U+201C>the Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!<U+201D> Trump was not always so fond of the Electoral College. On election night in 2012, Trump ranted about the Electoral College when he appeared to believe, incorrectly, that President Barack Obama lost the popular vote to Mitt Romney. <U+201C>He lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Paul Hannon \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/oecd-says-trumps-policies-could-lift-global-growth-1480327202 \n text: U.S. and global economic growth would be boosted by increases in spending and tax cuts promised by President-elect Donald Trump, but those gains would be lost if he pressed ahead with threatened tariff increases that triggered retaliation, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Monday. During his campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to boost infrastructure spending by as much as $1 trillion, although the details of how that would be financed are sketchy. He has also promised to cut corporate and personal income taxes. In its twice-yearly report on global economic prospects, the Paris-based research body said that while the exact form it would take is uncertain, it does expect Mr. Trump to offer some fiscal stimulus from the early months of his presidency, and that its likely scale that would boost U.S. economic growth to 2.3% from 1.9% in 2017, and to 3% from 2.2% in 2018. There would also be benefits for other parts of the world as U.S. demand for imports rises, with global economic growth raised to 3.3% from 3.2% in 2017, and to 3.6% from 3.3% in 2018. The OECD is the first international economic policy agency to publish an estimate of the likely impact of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s proposals. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s now some prospect of the world exiting from this low-growth trap,<U+201D> said <U+00C1>ngel Gurria, the OECD<U+2019>s secretary-general. <U+201C>Even though we still show the signs of those very heavy legacies of the crisis, we may be at a moment where we could see a turn for the better.<U+201D> The OECD<U+2019>s forecasts are based on an increase in U.S. government spending in 2017 and 2018 of 0.25% of gross domestic product, a cut in income taxes that reduces government revenue by 0.5% of GDP in each year, and a cut in the corporate tax rate that reduces revenue by 0.75% of GDP in 2018. It calculates that thanks to the boost to growth, such a package would leave the government<U+2019>s debts slightly smaller as a share of economic output. The OECD, which gives policy advice to its 35 members, said other governments should also provide more fiscal stimulus than now planned, since that would further boost global growth. With the room for monetary policy initiatives that boost growth having been <U+201C>exhausted,<U+201D> the OECD has in recent years urged more investment spending by governments as a way out of what it calls the <U+201C>low-growth trap.<U+201D> <U+201C>The actions and proposals we have seen so far are not enough,<U+201D> said Mr. Gurria, who added the plans of most European governments <U+201C>are too timid.<U+201D> But it warned that a slide toward protectionism could offset the boost from higher government spending and lower taxes. In addition to his pledges on spending and taxation, Mr. Trump said he would introduce higher tariffs on imports from China and Mexico, and reassess other trade relationships that he said placed U.S. workers at a disadvantage. <U+201C>Protectionism and inevitable trade retaliation would offset much of the effects of the fiscal initiatives on domestic and global growth, raise prices, harm living standards, and leave countries in a worsened fiscal position,<U+201D> said Catherine Mann, the OECD<U+2019>s chief economist. The OECD estimates that for some of its members more than 25% of jobs depend on foreign demand. Rather than resort to trade barriers in an attempt to protect some jobs in the short term, the OECD said governments would do better to help those who have lost their jobs acquire new skills. <U+201C>Let<U+2019>s protect those who may be disadvantaged by the globalization process, but lets not stop the globalization process,<U+201D> said Mr. Gurria. Turning to the U.K., the OECD raised its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.2% from 1% in September, but said it expects the economy to slow further in 2018 to grow by just 1% as uncertainty about the terms of the country<U+2019>s departure from the European Union weakens business investment. Its forecasts are lower than those of the U.K.<U+2019>s Office for Budget Responsibility, which last week said it expects the economy to grow by 1.4% next year and 1.7% in 2018. In a budget update Wednesday,<U+00A0>U.K. Treasury chief Philip Hammond signaled a new course after almost a decade of belt-tightening, saying he expects billions in extra borrowing over the next few years to support the economy as it exits the EU. <U+201C>The latest government plans...indicate a slower pace of fiscal consolidation and some increase in public investment,<U+201D> the OECD said. <U+201C>A more significant increase in public investment would support demand in the near term and boost supply in the longer term.<U+201D> Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com",

[In the music business] it<U+2019>s obvious that we<U+2019>ve had to, you know, women and minorities have had to fight for, you know, trying to get equal opportunities for, for ages . . . . There<U+2019>s not enough diversity . . . . I<U+2019>m just an entertainer but, um, you know, I<U+2019>m a fan of Hillary [Clinton] . . . of course I<U+2019>m a fan of Hillary. Of course I would love to see a woman president.<U+201D> \nCarey is very much in the news these days because Australian playboy billionaire James Packer recently broke off their engagement. Rumors have it that one of the reasons for the breakup was her <U+201C>insane spending sprees<U+201D>. \nAccording to an account in New York Post <U+2018>s <U+201C> Page Six <U+201D> on Oct. 27, 2016, the following are examples of Carey<U+2019>s <U+201C>over-the-top . . . frenzied spending that may have doomed her engagement to Packer<U+201D>: Sources say Carey <U+201C>regularly drops $10,000 to get her hair and makeup perfect <U+2014> even if it<U+2019>s all going to last just a single day.<U+201D> Power 105<U+2019>s The Breakfast Club radio host Charlamagne Tha God, aka Lenard McKelvey, who knows the singer, told The Post : <U+201C>Mariah is the last of the divas <U+2014> she<U+2019>s got a very old-school approach to stardom. It<U+2019>s champagne-in-the-morning type stuff. She [once] shared some with the Breakfast Club staff at 10 o<U+2019>clock in the morning, but she did not pour her own champagne <U+2014> someone else poured it for her.<U+201D> In 2014, Carey <U+2014> who once called overhead lighting <U+201C>abusive<U+201D> <U+2014> showed up to a filmed radio interview on The Breakfast Club over an hour late, with her own lighting crew in tow. McKelvey told The Post : <U+201C>I remember thinking to myself, damn, what kind of disposable income she has where she has her own lighting director? That was the first and only time that that has ever happened on the radio show.<U+201D> Carey reportedly drops at least $45,000 a year on spa treatments for her dogs <U+2014> Jack Russells named Cha Cha and Jill E. Beans <U+2014> even flying them first class to LA in January, which cost over $2,000 per dog. A close friend of Packer told Woman<U+2019>s Day last month that Carey <U+201C>spends $100,000 a month ordering exotic flowers from around the world to where she happens to be.<U+201D> Carey has her own yacht, the Capri, which costs a cool $340,000 per week plus expenses to maintain, according to <U+201C>Entertainment Tonight<U+201D> . She would use a ferry to reach Packer<U+2019>s boat, the Arctic P, which is the seventh-largest privately owned vessel in the world. Carey<U+2019>s closet is <U+201C>the stuff of legends, packed with more stilettos than the Barneys shoe department.<U+201D> She has a room just to store her shoes. In a recent Instagram showing off part of her vast footwear collection, she calls the room <U+201C>always my favorite room in the house<U+201D>. \nBut Mariah Carey tells us that women can<U+2019>t get a fair deal in anything and, in the music business, women and minorities have to fight for equal opportunities. \nIf you buy this delusional woman<U+2019>s music or go to her concerts, you<U+2019>re contributing to Mariah <U+201C>Marie Antoinette<U+201D> Carey<U+2019>s obscene spending that pollutes the environment and squanders the world<U+2019>s resources. \n~Eowyn",

Click to enlarge Part I Any inquisitive person should be asking themself why a seemingly anti-establishment candidate like Donald Trump has been allowed to get as far as he has in the U.S. presidential race for election November 8. The simplest answer is that he isn<U+2019>t anti-establishment and is only fronting a very convincing facade for public consumption. The family-made rich man has been strategically propped up as the all-accommodating GOP extremist opponent of candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, herself part of the very same establishment and even personal friend to Trump<U+2014>at least prior to the race. The two candidates come from the same organized criminal syndicate that leads back to Israel, its murderous Mossad terrorist organization, and the Lansky international crime syndicate. Furthermore, as we shall see, Trump is nothing more than a puppet of Mossad and is likely under their control through opportunism and, darker yet, blackmail. What Trump and his cronies all share in common is sexual compromise and their loyalty to the international Judeo-masonic power structure. Sexual blackmail and Illuminism Jeffrey Epstein and alleged child sex procurer Ghislaine Maxwell Perhaps the most powerful form of blackmail is that which involves sexual matters, and so it is that throughout human history, many men of power have been brought down upon revelation of some sexual scandal. It was through this channel that Adam Weishaupt<U+2019>s illuminism (blackmail) was so successful in his time through to today (Weishaupt stole the Catholic sacrament of confession and used for his own personal gain<U+2014>so that he could gain knowledge of people<U+2019>s sins in order to use it against them). Since then, it has proven to be the most useful form of blackmail employed, especially in the political world. Every person in a position of power should be suspected of being controlled through this form of blackmail, since the Judeo-masonic cryptocracy controls virtually every aspect of organized government, the press, and the financial system, to name a few. You may have heard of the bizarre sexual initiation of Yale University<U+2019>s Skull and Bones secret society, where the would-be bonesman reveals his sexual secrets to his fellow initiates and initiators. [ i ] From the very start of their societal ascent, you could say, a bonesman is blackmailed and falls under control of the society. Former Israeli Mossad case officer Victor Ostrovsky revealed in his first tell-all book about the Mossad: <U+201C><U+2026> there are three major <U+201C>hooks<U+201D> for recruiting people: money; emotion, be it revenge or ideology; and sex.<U+201D> [ ii ] This scenario is played out in virtually every sphere of influence at one degree (pun intended) or another. As it happens, both presidential candidates are connected to sexual scandals, the likes of which we shall explore in Trump<U+2019>s life. Mossad<U+2019>s child-sex ring procurers Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein",

Story Continued Below Denney's public plea comes as other Electoral College members in the region are seeking to persuade enough of their fellow electors to dump Trump. If 37 or more electors vote for someone other than Trump, it would kick the decision over to the House of Representatives. Electors are due to cast their ballots on Dec. 19 in state capitols across the country. But the Electoral College vote is usually a formality, as electors almost always respect the will of their state's voters. The last case of a member going rogue, known as a <U+201C>faithless elector,<U+201D> was in 2004 when a Minnesota elector slated to support John Kerry instead cast his vote for Kerry<U+2019>s running mate, John Edwards.

One Jewish family helps to brainwash the entire population of Sweden. This Swedish MP has had ENOUGH! \nThe uproar followed her letter to the Aftonbladet newspaper in which she said that <U+201C>ethnicity should be a factor<U+201D> in determining media ownership of more than 5 percent<U+2014>an obvious reference to the Jewish Bonnier family media group. \nThe Bonnier Group owns 96 book publishers, 42 business and trade press newspapers, 105 digital news platforms, 9 film production companies, 176 magazines, 23 major newspapers, 33 TV stations, and 33 <U+201C>other<U+201D> media outlets<U+2014>and quite literally dominates the controlled media in Sweden. \nHagwall had earlier submitted a motion to the Swedish parliament which proposed cuts to the state subsidies paid to media in Sweden. \nAlthough she never mentioned Jews by name, Hagwall said in an explanatory letter to the Aftonbladet that it would be a good idea to <U+201C>let Bonnier<U+2019>s newspapers go under<U+201D> so that <U+201C>no family, ethnic group, or company<U+201D> could control more than 5 percent of the media. \n<U+201C>An entire 80 percent of the media is owned and controlled by the same owners,<U+201D> Hagwell wrote. <U+201C>This is not acceptable. Therefore, media ownership should be spread over many independent companies and people. In order to change this, I suggest press subsidies [only] for the independent media.<U+201D> \nWhen asked by Aftonbladet how the abolition of press subsidies to the country<U+2019>s local newspapers reduce Bonnier<U+2019>s power over the media in Sweden, Hagwall answered by email that <U+201C>most small newspapers are directly or indirectly controlled by Bonnier, and why they have to be subsidized by the Swedish taxpayer is a mystery. \n<U+201C>Let the little Bonnier newspapers in the provinces go under, because then a void will be created which can be filled by newspapers that care about people and business owners.<U+201D> \nShe also said that the Swedish public service broadcaster, Sveriges Television (SVT), should be switched to pay channels to <U+201C>reduce SVT<U+2019>s propagation of the politically correct agenda.<U+201D> \nThe comments provoked a stream of attacks upon Hagwall, and the Swedish Democrat leadership also distanced itself from her, saying in a statement that the matter will <U+201C>affect her future in the party.<U+201D> \nThis week, Hagwall resigned her position as member of the Parliamentary Committee on Taxation and internal group leader of the Sweden Democrats<U+2019> tax policy group. She also will not seek reelection to Parliament in 2018 at the request of the party leadership, and it is currently unclear if she will continue to sit in parliament for the remainder of the current term.",

In separate news conferences, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) sounded upbeat about the prospects of advancing major goals to repeal President Barack Obama <U+2019>s signature health-care law , to cut taxes, and to roll back regulations, especially those dealing with the environment. <U+201C>The opportunity is to go big, to go bold, to get things done for the people of this country,<U+201D> Mr. Ryan said Wednesday at a news conference in his hometown of Janesville, Wis. Not every item on the agenda will be easy. Republicans have had deep differences with Mr. Trump, whose policy stances and contentious comments they criticized during the long and turbulent presidential campaign. Republicans are divided over trade policy and immigration, and many GOP leaders have questioned Mr. Trump<U+2019>s unorthodox questioning of NATO provisions that require members to defend each other. Hard-line fiscal conservatives are loath to raise the debt ceiling, a potentially market-rattling task that will be at hand next year, and many question whether Mr. Trump<U+2019>s goal of building a wall along the Mexican border is feasible. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re going to be enthusiastically supportive almost all the time, and where we have differences we will talk about them privately,<U+201D> Mr. McConnell said. Republicans and Mr. Trump himself on Wednesday began the process of reconciling. Through his staff, Mr. Trump has already reached out to the Main Street Partnership, which represents moderate Republicans, to say he knows that several Republicans in the group didn<U+2019>t support him, but that there are no hard feelings and everyone needs to get to work, said Rep. Chris Collins (R., N.Y.), a liaison between Congress and the Trump campaign. <U+201D>Mr. Trump has already shown in his speech he is going to be very magnanimous in victory,<U+201D> Mr. Collins said. For his part, Mr. Ryan was effusive in his praise for Mr. Trump, calling his victory <U+201C>the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime,<U+201D> and said he had spoken twice to Mr. Trump in the past 24 hours. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said that she too and spoken with Mr. Trump and would work with him to find common ground where possible. Dismantling the Obama administration<U+2019>s 2010 health-care law<U+2014>one of the main areas of agreement between Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans<U+2014>topped the GOP<U+2019>s quickly emerging legislative wish list. Republicans next year will also be positioned to dismantle the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, rewrite the tax code and boost military spending. But Democrats won<U+2019>t be powerless in the Senate, where most legislation needs 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles. Full GOP control of both chambers of Congress and the White House means Republicans will now be responsible for making potentially unpopular decisions over how to fund the government or raise its borrowing limit<U+2014>contentious bills which they have typically relied on a small handful of centrist Republicans and Democrats to carry in the past. The government will need to increase the debt limit sometime after March 2017. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s going to be tough,<U+201D> Rep. Phil Roe (R., Tenn.) said of raising the debt limit next year. <U+201C>We will get it done, but how we get it done, I couldn<U+2019>t tell you.<U+201D> Republicans will hold 52 seats in the Senate next year, with the Democratic caucus in control of 48 seats, assuming that Republican John Kennedy wins the Louisiana runoff in December, as expected. GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire conceded to Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan on Wednesday in the year<U+2019>s tightest Senate race. In the Senate, both parties will have to grapple with how to handle Mr. Trump<U+2019>s nominees to the Supreme Court, which has been operating with eight justices since Antonin Scalia died in February. Senate Democrats blasted Republicans for refusing all year to consider Merrick Garland, Mr. Obama<U+2019>s nominee to the high court. Now Democrats will have to decide whether to vote against Mr. Trump<U+2019>s nominees. A Democratic blockade could nudge Republicans to change the chamber<U+2019>s rules to allow Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed with just a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes currently required for high court nominees. GOP leaders will also have to forge a governing relationship with Mr. Trump, a political novice, as he seeks to push through the contentious domestic and foreign policy ideas he floated in his campaign. Mr. Trump, for instance, has pledged to build a wall along the Southern border and force Mexico to pay for it. It is unclear if congressional Republicans would be willing to allocate new funds for such a wall if Mexico declines to do so. Mr. McConnell and Mr. Ryan criticized Mr. Trump this year for his proposals to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his comments about women, among others. Mr. Ryan said in early October that he would no longer defend the GOP nominee after a 2005 video surfaced showing him talking in crude sexual terms about grabbing women without their consent. But Mr. Ryan struck a far more cooperative tone Wednesday in the hours after Mr. Trump<U+2019>s stunning victory, saying GOP leaders would work with him as he assumes power. <U+201C>Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard, <U+201C> Mr. Ryan said, noting that GOP leaders would coordinate with him on how to approach the final weeks this Congress will be in session before the new crop of lawmakers are sworn in in January. The biggest deadline facing Congress is the expiration of the government<U+2019>s current funding on Dec. 9. Republicans will now have less of an incentive to try to strike a long-term funding agreement with Mr. Obama, making it more likely that lawmakers may just agree to extend current funding levels until Mr. Trump is in office. Democrats said they hoped Mr. Trump would stick to his campaign pledge to push for higher infrastructure funding. <U+201C>We can work together to quickly pass a robust infrastructure jobs bill,<U+201D> Mrs. Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday. <U+201C>We have a responsibility to come together and find common ground.<U+201D> Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com",

More than 130 experts and political analysts from Russia and other countries are taking part in this year<U+0092>s three-day meeting, titled <U+0091>The Future in Progress: Shaping the World of Tomorrow<U+0092>.\nWhile Putin's speech can be seen below, he has already had a handful of pearls, most notably the following statement he just said in response to accusations that Russia could influence the US election:\n\"The number of mythical, dreamt-up problems include the hysteria - I can't think of another word - that has broken out in the United States about the influence of Russia on the current elections for the US president. Does anyone seriously think Russia can somehow influence the choice of the US people ?\"\nHe ended that phrase as follows: \"What, is America a banana republic?!\"\nPutin mocks claim that Russia is trying to influence the US elections: \"What, is America now a banana republic? America is a great power.\"\n<U+0097> Steve Rosenberg (@BBCSteveR) October 27, 2016\nAnd then, to emphasize his trolling, added the following: \"correct me if I am wrong.\"\nHe also had a handful of notable comments on the growing specter of a new cold war, starting by assuring the world that \"Russia doesn't plan to attack anyone\", and adding that \"Russian militaty threat is a myth\" although we are confident many in the Pentagon would be delighted to claim the opposite.\nHe said that NATO has outlived its usefullness as a structure and on the topic of the escalating proxy war in Syria, Putin had a simple comment: \"Our agreements with the US on Syria did not work out.\"\nFollow Putin's speech below.\nPresident of Russia Vladimir Putin : Tarja, Heinz, Thabo, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,\nIt is a great pleasure to see you again. I want to start by thanking all of the participants in the Valdai International Discussion Club, from Russia and abroad, for your constructive part in this work, and I want to thank our distinguished guests for their readiness to take part in this open discussion.\nOur esteemed moderator just wished me a good departure into retirement, and I wish myself the same when the time comes. This is the right approach and the thing to do. But I am not retired yet and am for now the leader of this big country. As such, it is fitting to show restraint and avoid displays of excessive aggressiveness. I do not think that this is my style in any case.\nBut I do think that we should be frank with each other, particularly here in this gathering. I think we should hold candid, open discussions, otherwise our dialogue makes no sense and would be insipid and without the slightest interest.\nI think that this style of discussion is extremely needed today given the great changes taking place in the world. The theme for our meeting this year, The Future in Progress: Shaping the World of Tomorrow , is very topical.\nLast year, the Valdai forum participants discussed the problems with the current world order. Unfortunately, little has changed for the better over these last months. Indeed, it would be more honest to say that nothing has changed.\nThe tensions engendered by shifts in distribution of economic and political influence continue to grow. Mutual distrust creates a burden that narrows our possibilities for finding effective responses to the real threats and challenges facing the world today. Essentially, the entire globalisation project is in crisis today and in Europe, as we know well, we hear voices now saying that multiculturalism has failed.\nI think this situation is in many respects the result of mistaken, hasty and to some extent over-confident choices made by some countries<U+0092> elites a quarter-of-a-century ago. Back then, in the late 1980s-early 1990s, there was a chance not just to accelerate the globalisation process but also to give it a different quality and make it more harmonious and sustainable in nature.\nBut some countries that saw themselves as victors in the Cold War, not just saw themselves this way but said it openly, took the course of simply reshaping the global political and economic order to fit their own interests.\nTo be continued.",

Shares of drugmakers rallied Wednesday on expectations that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election and Republican control of Congress would lessen the chances of government restrictions on drug prices<U+2014>a prospect that seemed on the rise in response to a public backlash against escalating prescription costs over the past few years. Mr. Trump did speak out against high drug prices at times during his campaign<U+2014>including supporting allowing the Medicare agency to directly negotiate lower drug prices with manufacturers<U+2014>but he didn<U+2019>t propose as many specific measures against prices as Mrs. Clinton did. Analysts said price reform may be relatively low on his list of priorities. Mrs. Clinton had proposed various measures including levying fines on drug companies that imposed unjustified price hikes, as well as capping patients<U+2019> out-of-pocket costs for expensive drugs. Those plans, and repeated promises throughout her campaign to take on drug prices, have had a chilling effect on drug stocks since she first voiced her intentions in a single tweet more than a year ago. J.P. Morgan analysts said in a research note the election outcome <U+201C>substantially diminishes the likelihood of significant pricing reform emanating from Washington.<U+201D> Mr. Trump has pledged that on <U+201C>day one<U+201D> of his administration he will ask Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The pharmaceutical industry was broadly supportive of the law when it was passed in 2010 and has benefited from the millions more Americans who gained health insurance under its provisions. If Congress repeals the law, legislators must replace it with <U+201C>something that doesn<U+2019>t cause chaos and doesn<U+2019>t make things worse than they are now,<U+201D> said Ron Cohen, chief executive of drugmaker Acorda Therapeutics Inc., in an interview Despite the election outcome, the industry still has to reckon with <U+201C>the very real concerns the public has<U+201D> about drug prices and health-care affordability, said Dr. Cohen, who is also chairman of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a trade group. <U+201C>Those issues have not changed substantively just because we have a new administration,<U+201D> he said. The NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index jumped 8.9%. Shares of Celgene Corp. rose 8.6%, Allergan PLC was up 8%, Pfizer Inc. rose 7%, and Gilead Sciences Inc. rose 4.4%. In Europe, Shire PLC was up 7.3%, Novo Nordisk A/S climbed 4.3% and Roche Holding AG was up 4.6%. Drug wholesalers and other industry middlemen also got a boost, with McKesson up 6.4% and Express Scripts up 3.4%. The pharmaceutical industry<U+2019>s main lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, issued a statement Wednesday saying it planned to work with the new administration and members of Congress to <U+201C>enhance the private market, improve patient access to care and foster the development of innovative medicines.<U+201D> The group said it favored changes to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration <U+201C>to keep pace with scientific advances,<U+201D> among other policies. Novo Nordisk A/S, a Danish drugmaker that along with France<U+2019>s Sanofi SA has faced criticism for boosting U.S. prices for insulin, said it was too early to predict how the Trump presidency would affect the industry. <U+201C>On the one hand there is campaign rhetoric, and on the other there are the issues the successful candidate prioritizes, and the need for actions to be ratified by Congress,<U+201D> said a spokesman for Novo Nordisk. <U+201C>We will therefore await concrete proposals.<U+201D> Fueling the rally Wednesday, the pharmaceutical industry successfully fended off a ballot measure in California aimed at curbing drug spending. A majority of voters, 53.8%, rejected Proposition 61, which would have required most state agencies to pay no more for prescription drugs than the discounted prices negotiated by the U.S. Veterans Affairs Department. The pharmaceutical industry had spent more than $100 million on TV ads and other efforts to defeat Proposition 61, arguing it could lead to higher drug costs for many Californians. Supporters of Proposition 61, including former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, said drugmakers are overcharging consumers for their products. The defeat of Proposition 61 could chill efforts in other states to take aim at drug prices, said Wells Fargo analyst David Maris. Some analysts also said the election outcome could increase the odds of a so-called holiday to allow U.S.-based multinational companies to bring back foreign earnings at reduced U.S. tax rates. That would be a boost for many pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Merck that have billions of dollars in profits outside the U.S. Drug makers repatriated billions of dollars during a similar holiday during the George W. Bush administration. Evercore ISI noted that Republicans, even with a slim control of Congress, could use special budgeting rules to pass tax-reform legislation. <U+2014>Joseph Walker and Jonathan D.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Madeline Conway Isaac Arnsdorf Nolan D. McCaskill Jack Shafer \n source: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/donald-trump-constitution-liberals-231783 \n text: On his first day in office, they say, Trump could find himself in violation of the seldom-used sentence in the Constitution.  | Getty By Madeline Conway 11/22/16 07:46 PM EST An obscure line in the Constitution has become a rallying point for some legal experts and critics of Donald Trump, who fear the president-elect has little intention of making a clean break between his business interests and his new White House role. On his first day in office, they say, Trump could find himself in violation of the seldom-used sentence unless he disentangles himself entirely from his sprawling global empire. Story Continued Below There<U+2019>s just one problem: In all likelihood, it<U+2019>s up to his fellow Republicans to enforce. Known as the foreign Emoluments Clause, it states that <U+201C>no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.<U+201D> In essence, it bars public officials from taking a gift from a foreign government unless they receive approval from Congress, with the goal of preventing foreign actors from using such a favor to wield influence on American policy. President Barack Obama<U+2019>s administration looked at the provision before he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize to make sure the award would not violate it. At the time, the Justice Department<U+2019>s Office of Legal Counsel determined that since the prize came from the Nobel Committee <U+2014> and not a <U+201C>king, prince or foreign state<U+201D> <U+2014> it was no problem for Obama to accept it without the consent of Congress. That<U+2019>s a different question, however, than whether a President Trump, through his business, could accept money from a foreign government while serving in the White House. By Isaac Arnsdorf Richard Painter, the former chief ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush, set off an online frenzy over the Emoluments Clause this weekend when he told the liberal blog ThinkProgress that Trump may violate it if foreign officials, like diplomats considering staying at his hotel in Washington to please him, pay his company when he is president. That kind of transaction, Painter elaborated, could be considered a gift from a foreign state under the Emoluments Clause. For a foreign diplomat, the value of staying at a hotel with <U+201C>Trump<U+201D> in its name might go up because it involves the president. That would make it a gift, and a potential violation of the Constitution on Day One of Trump<U+2019>s presidency, Painter said. Liberals have seized on that argument to urge Trump to divest his business empire, rather than simply leave its day-to-day management up to his children, as he has promised. Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland, said Tuesday that he plans to introduce a resolution calling on Trump to <U+201C>convert his assets to simple, conflict-free holdings, adopt blind trusts, or take other equivalent measures, in order to ensure compliance with the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.<U+201D> Others have seconded Painter<U+2019>s reasoning, saying that Trump<U+2019>s vast web of foreign business entanglements sets him up to violate at least the spirit of the clause. They note, though, that its enforcement mechanism is essentially political. Trump<U+2019>s determination to cling to his global empire <U+201C>creates an ongoing risk that foreign individuals and interests will confer commercial benefits on hotels, golf courses, or other businesses<U+201D> connected to him, argued Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University. Presidential Transition By Katie Glueck The greatest worry, according to Tribe, would be that those benefits might induce a President Trump to make or influence decisions <U+201C>to the disadvantage of national interests<U+201D> and in favor of his own. <U+201C>Trump can<U+2019>t receive any direct payment of any kind from a foreign government, including a fee for services,<U+201D> argued Noah Feldman, another professor at Harvard and an expert on constitutional law, in a column for Bloomberg View. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think you can say it<U+2019>s a clear violation of black-letter law, but it<U+2019>s a clear violation of the spirit of the Emoluments Clause,<U+201D> said David Kopel, an adjunct professor of constitutional law at the University of Denver and research director at the Independence Institute, a libertarian think tank. Kopel, who also believes that the Clinton Foundation<U+2019>s decision to take gifts from foreign interests when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state qualified as a violation of the clause, called the incentive for foreign diplomats to stay at a Trump hotel <U+201C>the tip of the iceberg<U+201D> of the president-elect<U+2019>s problems under the provision. When his company works with businesses abroad, that, too, raises questions, he said. <U+201C>There are all kinds of ways where foreign governments using private organizations are going to be buying influence in this administration, as they did when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state,<U+201D> Kopel asserted. There is not total consensus: Seth Barrett Tillman, a lecturer in law at Maynooth University in Ireland, takes a different position, arguing that the Emoluments Clause does not actually apply to the president. Among other points, he cites the precedent of George Washington taking two gifts from French officials without congressional approval. <U+201C>That doesn<U+2019>t mean Trump can do anything, but it means we shouldn<U+2019>t reach to the Constitution to do the heavy lifting,<U+201D> Tillman said. That appears to be Trump<U+2019>s preferred interpretation as well. On Tuesday, he told reporters and editors at the New York Times: \"The law's totally on my side, the president can't have a conflict of interest.<U+201D> Presidential Transition By Nolan D. McCaskill Painter said that he disagrees with Tillman<U+2019>s interpretation, but he acknowledged in an interview that there are likely few enforcement mechanisms to stop Trump even if he does violate this clause of the Constitution, given that there are no obvious parties with standing to sue. A rival hotel could theoretically file suit, for instance, but Painter said bringing a case would be difficult. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think it<U+2019>s going to get in the courts,<U+201D> he said. That leaves the political process as the enforcement mechanism, Painter said <U+2014> and with respect to the president, that mechanism is impeachment, a move to which the Republican Congress would have to sign on. So far, however, only one GOP member has even commented on Trump<U+2019>s conflicts of interest: Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who took to Twitter to say that it would be <U+201C>a big deal<U+201D> if Trump had contracts with foreign governments. And even Amash, a libertarian-leaning ally of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, doesn<U+2019>t seem eager to be too vocal: Asked to elaborate on his thoughts on Trump<U+2019>s foreign business ties, his office declined to comment. <U+201C>What that leaves is public pressure to enforce the clause,<U+201D> Feldman wrote. <U+201C>Trump should take that pressure seriously, and divest himself from any business of any kind with foreign governments.<U+201D> For now, Trump doesn<U+2019>t appear to be feeling the heat. In his meeting with the Times, he shrugged off a question about his possible conflicts of interest by lashing out at critics like Painter. <U+201C>If it were up to some people,<U+201D> he said, <U+201C>I would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again.<U+201D> Still, Painter predicted, questions about Trump<U+2019>s overseas assets will continue to dog him throughout his presidency unless he divests himself of the Trump Organization altogether. If a foreign client asked someone working for the company for a favor from the U.S. government, for example, that could lead to political blowback, even if Trump never learned of the request or acted on it. <U+201C>If he owns it, he<U+2019>s going to be accountable anytime someone says something stupid,<U+201D> Painter said. <U+201C>If he continues to own his businesses, the emolument problems do not go away.<U+201D> By Thomas Wright By Bill Scher By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

The detonation was estimated at around the same size as the US nuclear devices that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. \nWhat made this test different was the announcement by Pyongyang that it had <U+2018>standardized<U+2019> production of nuclear warheads and, even more important, reduced their size and weight so they could be fitted atop medium and long-ranged missiles. Previous North Korean nuclear devices were believed too heavy and bulky to be delivered by missiles. \nWestern experts believe North Korea will have 20 nuclear warheads by the end of this year, though how many of them can be delivered by missile is not known. The North has no long-ranged missiles that can hit North America, contrary to this week<U+2019>s hysteria. Its new submarine-launched missile, a real potential threat to the US mainland, is still many years away from deployment. No one seems to care that India has ICBM<U+2019>s and sea-launched SLBM<U+2019>s that can hit the US today. \nNorth Korea<U+2019>s missile force is not designed to attack the United States but rather to deter any invasion or nuclear strike by US forces. The US Air Force underlined this potential threat by flying two nuclear-capable B-1 heavy bombers near the border with North Korea. \nFor North Korea, most of South Korea is too close for potential nuclear attack. Radiation would blow back over North Korea. Only the South<U+2019>s most important southern port, Busan, through which any invading US forces would pass, might be a viable target. \nEven if North Korean missiles could strike the mainland United States, there would be an immediate US nuclear riposte from Guam, Japan and the powerful 7th Fleet that would turn North Korea to radioactive dust. Kim Jong-un is neither mad nor suicidal. \nBut the North<U+2019>s growing force of medium-ranged missiles could hit Japan<U+2019>s home islands, Okinawa, and Guam, America<U+2019>s primary Asian military bases. Three or four N Korean nuclear weapons could cripple Japan. \nIn effect, North Korea holds Japan a nuclear hostage. Japan has no leak-proof defense against nuclear missiles. Its lack of nuclear weapons means that Japan is naked before the North Korean threat and must rely on the uncertain US nuclear umbrella and unproven anti-missile systems. \nThat<U+2019>s why presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed that Japan be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. It<U+2019>s unacceptable for the world<U+2019>s third largest economy to be held in thrall by pipsqueak but nasty North Korea. \nJapan has considered developing nuclear weapons for decades but US pressure and anti-militarist public opinion have prevented Tokyo from doing so. \nJapan could produce a nuclear weapon in three months if it so decided. But it won<U+2019>t, and so remains vulnerable to North Korea and to nuclear-armed China with which Japan is in a serious confrontation in the South China Sea and off the Ryuku Islands. \nThe US and South Korea have staged their annual Fall military exercises that mimic an invasion of North Korea. Each year, North Korea blows its top when this provocation occurs. There<U+2019>s no military need <U+2013> it<U+2019>s merely primitive chest-thumping by Washington and Seoul and tantrum-time for the North. Call it North Asian Primeval Scream Therapy. \nInterestingly, this time South Korea<U+2019>s conservative government led by PM Park Geun-hye joined the all-Korean threat-a-thon by vowing to turn Pyongyang <U+2018>to ashes<U+2019> if it was seen preparing a nuclear attack on the South. In fact, South Korea lacks this military capability in spite of recent additions of new artillery missiles. Seoul<U+2019>s threats were more designed to placate angry right-wing South Korean Christian voters than to intimidate the North. \nBut it<U+2019>s also worth recalling that in the late 1970<U+2019>s, the US forced the current prime minister<U+2019>s father, President Park Chung-he, to halt his secret nuclear weapons program. Today, South Korea still has good reasons to develop a few nukes, though much of North Korea is too close for retaliatory strikes. Both sides in Korea would be better off with small, tactical nuclear weapons. \nIt<U+2019>s always fun watching the hot-tempered Koreans hurl threats at one another and the US. Yet one of these days, threats could turn to real shooting on the Peninsula. Think of the Japanese nuclear melt-down at Fukushima<U+2026>and then multiply by 150.",

Ross, 78, is the founder of the private equity firm WL Ross & Co., known for restructuring failed companies, and he's an economic adviser to Trump. Story Continued Below Carl Icahn appeared to confirm the news that Ross is the leading candidate for Commerce Tuesday, tweeting , \"Spoke to @realDonaldTrump. Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross are being considered for Treasury and Commerce. Both would be great choices.\" Ross has been a vociferous critic of trade deals negotiated over the last 25 years, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has vowed to leave unless Mexico and Canada agree to renegotiate on more favorable terms. <U+201C>I think there<U+2019>s a big difference between the impact of trade agreements on corporate America and the impact on Mr. and Mrs. America,<U+201D> Ross told CNBC in an interview earlier this year. <U+201C>Corporate America has adjusted to them by investing lots of capital offshore. <U+2026> What we<U+2019>re doing is we<U+2019>re exporting jobs and importing products, instead of exporting products and keeping jobs.<U+201D> Along with fellow Trump campaign adviser Peter Navarro, an University of California-Irvine economics and public policy professor, Ross has called for future trade deals to include automatic renegotiation triggers if trade gains <U+201C>are not distributed fairly<U+201D> and other <U+201C>safeguards<U+201D> including ironclad sanctions against currency manipulation, zero tolerance on intellectual property theft and stringent environmental and health and safety standards. White House By Nahal Toosi <U+201C>He<U+2019>s not the first rich old white guy to hold the job,<U+201D> said Bill Reinsch, a distinguished fellow at the Stimson Institute. <U+201C>Some of them were pretty good <U+2014> [Ronald Reagan<U+2019>s Commerce Secretary Malcolm] Baldrige for example. I don't know Ross, but he certainly seems qualified.<U+201D> <U+201C>During the campaign, Mr. Ross was a vocal supporter of the Trump economic plan,<U+201D> said Scott Miller, a trade policy specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. <U+201C>That said, I have no idea why someone that wealthy and independent would want to be the Commerce secretary.<U+201D> The Commerce secretary oversees the administration of U.S. trade remedy laws designed to keep out unfairly-traded imports, giving that person a major role in fulfilling Trump<U+2019>s promise of a more confrontational stance against China, which is already the focus of most U.S. anti-dumping and countervailing duty actions. The Commerce secretary manages a huge government bureaucracy, including disparate agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Census Bureau and the Minority Business Development Agency. If he is nominated, Ross is also likely to face new questioning related to the January, 2006 Sago mine disaster in Sago, W.Va., which killed a dozen workers. The mine was owned by a subsidiary of one of his companies, International Coal Group, Inc. Ross faced findings that he ignored dozens of safety concerns and citations. Federal investigators pointed to a lightning strike as the \"most likely\" ignition source for the blast but said that proper methane monitoring, among other things, could have prevented the disaster. The federal Mine Safety and Health Commission imposed fines of $134,000, which were later reduced. A spokesman for Trump's presidential transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Ross' affiliation with International Textile Group. He no longer owns it. By Michael Grunwald By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz",

The facts are that she definitely worked in the United States before getting her first visa in 1996 : \nMrs. Trump, who received a green card in March 2001 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006, has always maintained that she arrived in the country legally and never violated the terms of her immigration status. During the presidential campaign, she has cited her story to defend her husband<U+2019>s hard line on immigration. \nThe wife of the GOP presidential nominee, who sometimes worked as a model under just her first name, has said through an attorney that she first came to the U.S. from Slovenia on Aug. 27, 1996, on a B1/B2 visitor visa and then obtained an H-1B work visa on Oct. 18, 1996. \nThe documents obtained by the AP show she was paid for 10 modeling assignments between Sept. 10 and Oct. 15, during a time when her visa allowed her generally to be in the U.S. and look for work but not perform paid work in the country. The documents examined by the AP indicate that the modeling assignments would have been outside the bounds of her visa. \nLater reports from the Trump organization about her immigration status appeared to show that under the Republican nominee<U+2019>s own policies , Melania Trump probably would not be allowed in the country. \nImmigration violations can be re-litigated at any later date, if they are fraud or misrepresentation on any of the documents used to gain entry or US citizenship, although this almost never happens. \nThe AP reports that the United States government only seeks to revoke citizenship in the <U+201C>most egregious cases, such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes.<U+201D> \nHowever, it<U+2019>s likely that Melania Trump<U+2019>s immigration status and her Republican nominee husband<U+2019>s hypocritical stances towards immigration may be thrust into the maelstrom of the waning days of this year<U+2019>s presidential campaign. \nThe big question is: Using the Trump standard for deportation <U+2013> which would send his wife home to Slovenia <U+2013> will the Republican candidate petition to send his wife out of the United States?",

The globalists are split but Plan B has been initiated. Paul Ryan has been in the hip pocket of the globalists all along. He supports a border-less America and is a fervent supporter of the Free Trade Agreements. He is a wannabe member of the criminal elite. He is, and has always been the Plan B for the Global Elite. Paul Ryan filed paperwork to run for President in January of 2016 Paul Ryan released the Trump locker-room tapes in act of Benedict Arnold type of betrayal. With 10 days left to the general election, she will not be indicted before the election. Even if her popular support goes south, she will still win because of the tampering with the electoral college by the Soros and the Clinton Foundation. Soros has his voting machines in 16 states, some of them are key battleground states. Hillary will win even if she only gets 20% of the vote and that is where this is headed. Ever die-hard Democrats can no longer stay of the good ship Witchcraft. Hillary will never board Air Force One, maybe Broomstick One, but not Air Force One. She will be elected but indicted before the inauguration. Kaine, the Democratic VP candidate and Hillary will be knocked out of contention when Hillary is indicted. AND WHO IS NEXT IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION? IT IS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, PAUL <U+201C>RAT<U+201D> RYAN. THAT<U+2019>S WHO. I HATE TO SAY I TOLD YOU SO, BUT I HAVE BEEN SAYING SINCE APRIL THAT PAUL RYAN WOULD BECOME PRESIDENT. \nWhat Do the Globalists Gain by Following this Course of Action? \nIf Paul Ryan ascends to the Presidency, it will be business as usual for the criminal elite. The TPP will pass and they will get their war with Russia. Further, America will be on the path of destruction courtesy of this elite wannabe, Paul Ryan \nPerhaps the biggest advantage that the globalists will enjoy will the fact that they can minimize resistance. Let<U+2019>s face it, that when it comes to politics and current events, half of the country is dumber than a box of rocks. These people will see this as a victory over the unpopular Clinton. However, at the end of the day, Clinton or Ryan, it does not make a bit of difference!!! \nI just got word that the Clinton Foundation is under IRS investigation as well. Look for the Clinton empire to launch a series of false flag attacks now that they realize that the end is coming for this modern day version of Bonnie and Clyde. \nSupporting documentation follows? This Has Been a Set Up Since the Beginning: Paul Ryan Is Responsible for the Release of the Trump Tape \nAlex Jones made a very compelling case that Paul Ryan<U+2019>s top aide, Dan Senor, was behind the leaking of the Bush tape in which Trump is heard to make several lewd remarks about women. \nFrom Info Wars : \n<U+201C>That<U+2019>s the story swirling around the Internet after Senor<U+2019>s wife, former NBC reporter Campbell Brown, appeared to confirm the claim. \nBrown quoted a tweet that said, <U+201C>Rumblings that Campbell Brown and Dan Senor are behind the Trump tape leak,<U+201D> and then responded, <U+201C>Yep. Still having fun after all these years. Key to a happy marriage.<U+201D> \nA similar story released by WND confirms Info Wars claim that Dan Senor leaked the Trump tape in an obvious attempt to sink the Trump campaign. \nAfter reviewing the Info Wars, WND and other similar claims, there is little doubt that Paul Ryan deliberately sabotaged Donald Trump<U+2019>s campaign. But why? Why would a prominent Republican sabotage the campaign of the Republican nominee? Well, it is for the same reason that anyone engages in treason, for personal profit. Paul Ryan Is Aligned With Clinton and Obama, Making Him a Globalist Favorite \nPaul Ryan has doing his best to help Hillary Clinton defeat Donald Trump. In fact, with encouragement from Ryan, through his very shallow endorsement of Donald Trump. It is becoming a distinct possibility that Trump may not be the nominee when the election finally takes place. \nThere is no way that the establishment and their minions can afford to have a Trump Presidency. This means that in order to dump Trump, the globalists must create a world where up is down and down is up, white is black and black is white. To some degree, the <U+201C>tape<U+201D> has accomplished this. \nPaul Ryan, much to the detriment of the American people, is where is he is at today because he was willing to ignore the following as if they did not exist: The free trade agreements which have caused the loss of millions of American jobs so that manufacturers could send millions of jobs offshore to cheap foreign labor markets and then turn around and ship these products back into the United States tax free. Trump has pledged to stop this. Ignore the illegal alien crisis which continues to undercut the wages of the working class, thus leading to much lower salaries and higher unemployment for American workers. Support Obamacare and its provision which forces employers to purchase Obamacare medical insurance for its full time employees. This has greatly added to the demise of small businesses. The undermining of American national security through the admission of UNSCREENED Muslims to America. Supporting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton led State Department policy which protects certain Mosques and Muslims with extreme terrorist ties such as what we saw with Omar Mateen. Ryan is complicit in allowing the same chaos that is destroying Europe with UNSCREENED Muslim immigration, to come to America and destroy this country. His failure to oppose should be construed as tacit support. This attitude has given rise to the attitude that it is acceptable for these Refugee/Resettlement immigrants to support Sharia Law over our Constitutional law. \nTrump is on the record as opposing each and everyone of the above policies which are destroying America. Most Americans support Trump in this endeavor of putting America first and Making America Great Again ! However, most of Congress is on the take and avail themselves to what should be illegal bribery through corporate campaign contributions. In order to keep the gravy train rolling, politicians, like Paul Ryan, are willing forsake their Constitutional oath and oppose Trump<U+2019>s pro-Constitutional stand on these issues. In fact, Ryan is of such low moral character that he is even willing to destroy the GOP in order to preserve the criminal status quo, while he receives blood money from the corporations, as evidenced by his release of the Trump tape. The Silver Bullet \nHere is the proof that Ryan is eligible to run for President. \n\nFrom the Federal Election Commission website: \nFEC FORM 1",

The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, fell 0.4% to 91.50. The dollar was down against currencies of oil-producing countries, falling 0.7% against the Canadian dollar and 0.4% against the Norwegian krone. Oil prices oscillated Monday, closing up 1.8%, as investors continue to assess the prospects that OPEC members agree to rein in production ahead of Wednesday<U+2019>s main meeting. A production cut would likely support oil prices and boost the currencies of oil exporters such as Canada, Russia and Norway. <U+201C>All eyes will be on the OPEC meeting this week to see what sized production cut we might have in store,<U+201D> said Brad Bechtel, a currency strategist at Jefferies Group, in a research note.

Upbeat reports would further solidify the Federal Reserve<U+2019>s case for raising interest rates next month. Markets are already pricing in a 96% chance that the Fed raises rates at its December meeting, according to CME Group data.

She had been called <U+201C>a slimy Jewess.<U+201D> She had been told she <U+201C>deserved the oven.<U+201D> One anonymous individual had electronically harassed her for 19 hours straight. Things got so bad that Bethany Mandel, a 30-year-old freelance writer in Highland Park, N.J., decided one afternoon last spring to drive to a nearby gun shop. A mother of two small children, she now keeps a .22 in her home. What had she done to provoke so much vitriol? She posted some messages on Twitter drawing attention to the fact that Donald J. Trump seemed to have a lot of anti-Semitic supporters. In some respects, Mrs. Mandel<U+2019>s story has become a familiar one. She is among hundreds of Jewish journalists who have been the target of anti-Semitic attacks on Twitter during the 2016 presidential campaign , according to a new report by the Anti-Defamation League. Anti-Semitism has been resurgent in Europe for years. But it has taken on a new dimension in the United States with the emergence of the Trump campaign, whose battle against political correctness has provided a kind of on-ramp for bigotry to enter the political mainstream. During its investigation, the organization found that 2.6 million anti-Semitic messages were posted on Twitter from August 2015 to July 2016. Of those, 19,253 were directed at journalists. There was a significant uptick starting early this year, when the presidential campaign began to intensify, the organization said in its report, to be released on Wednesday. More than 800 journalists have been the subject of anti-Semitic attacks on Twitter, with 10 of them receiving 83 percent of the total attacks. The words appearing most frequently in the Twitter biographies of the attackers were <U+201C>Trump,<U+201D> <U+201C>nationalist,<U+201D> <U+201C>conservative<U+201D> and <U+201C>white.<U+201D> Many of the owners of the 1,600 Twitter accounts were anonymous, though at least two are prominent white supremacists: Andrew Anglin, the founder of the website The Daily Stormer, and Lee Rogers of the Infostormer. The report was careful not to suggest that the Trump campaign <U+201C>supported or endorsed<U+201D> the anti-Semitic attacks, but noted that many had been sent by his supporters. But some of the targets said that by evoking hostility toward minorities, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign had inspired and emboldened white nationalists and others to engage in acts of digital aggression toward <U+201C>others<U+201D> <U+2014> including Jews <U+2014> and toward Jewish journalists in particular. <U+201C>The best analogy I can give is that the campaign turned over a rock and a lot of stuff began crawling out from under it,<U+201D> said John Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary magazine. <U+201C>There were these code words and dog whistles that let it appear that people who had been doing things in the shadows could now start marching forward.<U+201D> Many of them have marched directly onto Twitter, no doubt because of its unique place in the political conversation: as a popular site for journalists, but also one of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s favorite modes of communication, and thus a gathering place for his supporters. <U+201C>What I worry about is that this portends something very dangerous for our democracy,<U+201D> said Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League. <U+201C>This is not just about anti-Semitism directed against Jews. The bigger story is the threat to free speech and the threat to a free press.<U+201D> The report was also critical of Twitter for not deleting or at least suspending the accounts of the vast majority of the offenders. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re seeing in a very coordinated way this kind of hate, and what we are not seeing are the platforms <U+2014> in this case, Twitter <U+2014> stepping up and dealing with it,<U+201D> Mr. Greenblatt said. In a statement, a Twitter spokesman noted that the company<U+2019>s policy prohibits anti-Semitic content and that it planned to introduce new policies and tools to ensure that its users felt safe in the coming weeks. A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, Hope Hicks, said in a statement responding to the report, <U+201C>We have no knowledge of this activity and strongly condemn any commentary that is anti-Semitic.<U+201D> She added, <U+201C>We totally disavow hateful rhetoric online or otherwise.<U+201D> While Mr. Trump and his campaign have not leveled any explicitly anti-Semitic attacks at journalists, he has trafficked in some anti-Semitic stereotypes. In July, he posted an image on his Twitter account of a six-pointed star next to Hillary Clinton, with money seeming to rain down in the background. Facing criticism, he deleted the tweet, but then said he regretted having done so. And in a speech last week in West Palm Beach, Fla., he accused Mrs. Clinton of guiding a <U+201C>global power structure<U+201D> that has conspired against the working class <U+2014> prompting a scolding on Twitter by Mr. Greenblatt. Whatever Mr. Trump<U+2019>s intentions, his candidacy has been treated as a call to arms by white nationalists, who often rush to attack Jewish journalists when they write something perceived as unflattering about Mr. Trump. After she wrote a profile of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s wife, Melania, for GQ magazine, the journalist Julia Ioffe was deluged with anti-Semitic taunts on Twitter. When Mrs. Trump was asked about the controversy, she said Ms. Ioffe had <U+201C>provoked<U+201D> her attackers. Jonathan Weisman, an editor at The New York Times, has been sent, among other things, cartoon drawings of the hooknosed Jew and an image of the gates of Auschwitz against the words: <U+201C>Machen Amerika Great.<U+201D> And when Ben Shapiro, a former editor at large at Breitbart, the right-wing news website, announced on Twitter the birth of his second child, he received this reply: <U+201C>Into the gas chamber with all four of you.<U+201D> There is little evidence that these attacks are working, at least as an intimidation tactic. On the contrary, some Jewish journalists have added triple parentheses around their names on Twitter, taking what had been a way for denizens of the alt-right <U+2014> an extremist fringe of message boards and online magazines popular with white supremacists <U+2014> to identify someone as Jewish, and turning it into a badge of honor. <U+201C>It seems to me that when the Twitter Nazis hate you, you are probably doing something right,<U+201D> said Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s when they like you <U+2014> and here I<U+2019>m thinking about a certain presidential candidate <U+2014> that you might have a problem.<U+201D> Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the First Draft newsletter .

An airline he owns has drawn the fifth-largest paycheck of any company the campaign paid through Oct. 19. Mr. Trump has also paid at least eight of his golf clubs, seven of his hotels and five of his restaurants. In all, the New York businessman has spent close to $10 million over the course of the election cycle reimbursing his children for travel expenses and family-owned companies for campaign services, the most recent Federal Election Commission reports show. Only four companies have been paid more than the set of Trump entities: Two of his media buyers, who have collectively been paid $59 million; a firm owned by his digital director, which has been paid $58 million; and the firm that makes his campaign hats, which has been paid $14 million. That cash returned to the Trump family and their companies amounts to nearly one-sixth of the total amount of personal money he has donated the campaign through Oct. 19<U+2014>$56 million. He gave another $10 million to his campaign on Friday , according to his advisers, bringing the total to $66 million<U+2014>a number that still falls far short of the $100 million Mr. Trump has said he would spend on his White House effort. Mr. Trump told Fox News he was unsure he would give as much as $100 million , saying, <U+201C>We<U+2019>ll see what<U+2019>s needed.<U+201D> His payments to his companies and frequent plugging of his various businesses on the campaign trail are unprecedented in presidential politics. Don McGahn, general counsel for Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign, has in past interviews defended the businessman<U+2019>s choice to use his properties and companies for campaign activities and said the campaign is complying with FEC rules. <U+201C>It makes perfect sense to me that you<U+2019>re going to use facilities that you know are of a certain quality,<U+201D> he said in an August interview. The campaign has also noted that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s donations to his campaign surpass the amount he paid his companies. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, also ran on his business record, having served as a managing partner of the private-equity firm Bain Capital. But unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Romney had some electoral experience, having served as governor of Massachusetts, and had detached himself from his work in the private sector years before mounting his presidential bid. <U+201C>He<U+2019>s running on his business background, since he has no political background,<U+201D> said Kenneth Gross, former FEC head of enforcement, of Mr. Trump. He warned that, if elected, Mr. Trump could struggle to detach himself from his businesses to avoid a significant conflict of interest. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s going to be difficult, and just turning it over to his children won<U+2019>t necessarily resolve that problem,<U+201D> Mr. Gross said. In a 2000 interview with Fortune magazine, Mr. Trump said, <U+201C>It<U+2019>s very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it.<U+201D> The GOP nominee has held more than 30 events at Trump properties since beginning his presidential campaign, including two recent stops at the hotel he opened in Washington, D.C. In the summer, he took a pack of reporters to Scotland for the reopening of his luxury golf resort there. At a press conference during the Republican primaries at a Florida golf club he owns, Mr. Trump displayed steaks, wine and bottles of water that bear his name. The Trump entities that received the largest checks were Tag Air, an airline Mr. Trump owns to which the campaign paid $6.7 million and Trump Tower, which was paid $1.4 million in rent. He also paid more than 35 other Trump companies, including Trump Restaurants LLC ($150,000), Trump Payroll Corp. ($186,000) and eight Trump golf clubs ($623,000)<U+2014>including $430,000 just to the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump spent the morning touting his new Washington hotel, in what his campaign billed as a purely corporate event<U+2014>despite the fact that his campaign staff and traveling press corps were also in attendance. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s latest report shows the campaign paid the hotel $13,431 on Oct. 17 for <U+201C>facility rental/catering services.<U+201D> A Trump spokeswoman didn<U+2019>t immediately return a request for comment about what that payment. The campaign reimbursed Mr. Trump<U+2019>s adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, as well as Eric<U+2019>s wife, Lara, a total of $33,958. It also paid nearly $11,000 to a wine manufacturing company owned by Eric Trump, including $6,000 earlier this month. Individuals with ties to Mr. Trump before the election have also reaped millions from the campaign. Giles-Parscale, the web marketing company, is run by Trump digital director Brad Parscale, who has worked since 2011 for Mr. Trump<U+2019>s companies in various capacities. His firm designed websites for Trump International Realty and Melania Trump, as well as for the Eric Trump Foundation. Ace Specialties, the hat-making company, is owned by Christl Mahfouz, who sits on the board of the Eric Trump Foundation. A firm owned by Dan Scavino, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s social media director who once served as a golf caddie at a Trump golf club in Westchester County, N.Y., has been paid $195,000. The campaign has also employed a firm with ties to a top donor. Hedge-fund executive Robert Mercer gave $2 million to a pro-Trump super PAC and recommended the elevation of Stephen Bannon and Kellyanne Conway to top positions in the campaign. He is part owner of Cambridge Analytica, which has received $5 million in payments. Despite Mr. Trump<U+2019>s payments to his companies, his businesses might not come out of the 2016 election better off. Trump Hotels last month released the name of a new hotel line: Scion, a rare Trump-owned brand not to bear the family name. The company<U+2019>s chief executive said it was always the plan not to feature the name <U+201C>Trump<U+201D> in the new brand name, which its news release said translates to <U+201C>descendant of a notable family.<U+201D> Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Lou Colagiovanni \n source: occupydemocrats.com \n text: Comments \nThe extreme Christian supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump present themselves as righteous holy rollers doing the work of God, but that is a ruse meant to disguise their true intentions of making women mere sexual pawns and exert patriarchal dominance over them. This fact was aptly pointed out by John Pavlovitz , a minister from Raleigh, North Carolina who published a scathing statement indicting all of the individuals who partake in this behavior. \nPavlovitz attempted to spare no feelings when he warned women about Trump, his supporters, and how those individuals truly view a woman<U+2019>s role in society: \nTo them, you aren<U+2019>t separate but equal, as they might claim from the pulpit. You may be made in the image of God, but not in the same way that they are. You are inferior. You are lesser than. You are Adam<U+2019>s rib meat; baby machines, meal preparers, arm candy, pleasure tools designed by God for men to use as they desire. Some of these men of God will have the guts to actually say this, others will simply prove it to you. They are proving it to you now. Listen to them.<U+201D> Pavlovitz says in their twisted patriarchal world, the men on the Christian Right think all men act like Trump, all men talk this way, all men think this way, but adds, <U+201C>No, we don<U+2019>t<U+2014>but they do.<U+201D> \nA line was drawn in the proverbial sand by Pavlovitz who harpooned the hypocrisy of Trump<U+2019>s supporters. Trump claims to respect women, as do those who are in favor of his candidacy. Yet, that does not rationally follow for if it were true, and if these individuals did have respect for women, they<U+2019>d dump Trump immediately: \nIf these professed men of God truly acknowledged your inherent value, they would be fiercely defending you right now, instead of Donald Trump. They would be openly condemning such disregard for the image of God within you, and sharply severing their ties with him<U+2014>but many of them they aren<U+2019>t. They<U+2019>re making excuses. They<U+2019>re blaming the victim. They<U+2019>re doubling down. They<U+2019>re digging in their manly heels right now. \nThe good minister pulled back the curtain to expose the sickening philosophy of these individuals. They care not about women as human beings, but consider them to be mere disposable objects to be used for their own nefarious purposes: \nThe real reason they<U+2019>re doing it, is because to them you aren<U+2019>t worth defending; not your intelligence or your gifts or your worth. As a result, your consent isn<U+2019>t really a concern either; you may have noticed that. It<U+2019>s why, in their minds sexual misconduct almost never occurs, and when it does, it<U+2019>s because you were dressed too provocatively or sending mixed signals, or because their motives were misinterpreted.They don<U+2019>t believe you have the right to say or no or to be offended. If anything, they believe you should be flattered. This is the hubris of men who think God made you as an accessory. \nIn an act of contrition and humility Pavlovitz apologized for the behavior of despicable men who behave as cowardly dogs. He stopped short of apologizing on the behalf of the men, as if he were their spokesperson: \nAs a Christian and a pastor and a man, I<U+2019>d liked to apologize to you for these men and what you endure from them, but I won<U+2019>t apologize to you on their behalf because that would mean aligning myself with them and I will not do that. They don<U+2019>t speak for me. They don<U+2019>t speak for many of us. They certainly don<U+2019>t speak for God. \nMinister John Pavlovitz<U+2019>s statement is worthy of a resounding round of applause. As a man of the cloth he truly embodies the values which he espouses, which is a rare and precious trait in a society full of millions of individuals who support Trump and believe that his word is the gospel. It is truly disheartening and frightening to know that while all citizens in the United States have the same rights, and all votes are equal, that so many would use those votes in a way which is detrimental to the lives of their fellow female citizens.",

Joni Ernst would not explicitly say she will accept the results of the election <U+2014> but said she hopes that she can.  | AP Photo By Seung Min Kim and Burgess Everett 10/20/16 01:57 PM EDT Updated 10/20/16 01:46 PM EDT TERRE HAUTE, Ind. <U+2014> Republican elected officials like Sen. Joni Ernst and Rep. Todd Young are having a tough time explaining Donald Trump's statement that he may not accept the results of the presidential election. On one hand, they don't want to undercut a Republican presidential nominee likely to win the conservative state of Indiana. But on the other, they don't want to be seen as endorsing Trump's conspiratorial claims that the election is \"rigged\" in places like Indiana, where Young could actually win a close Senate race without having to embrace electoral conspiracy theories. Story Continued Below That leaves them in a bit of rhetorical purgatory, forced to respond to Trump but unwilling to pick a fight with him. Young said Thursday there could be a \"psychological rigging of the election\" <U+2014> meaning Indiana voters don't show up to the polls on Election Day. But he declined to explicitly rebuke or defend Trump's refusal to back the election results. \"The only way this election will be rigged is if Hoosiers don<U+2019>t show up and vote, if those who are upset with the current course of the country don<U+2019>t show up to vote for change in the election. Then they will have rigged the election themselves,\" Young said. \"After Election Day, we respect the results of an election <U+2014> assuming the election is not very close and there<U+2019>s no need for a recount <U+2014> but we respect the results of an election.\" Pressed on whether Trump's rhetoric is bad for democracy, Young said he would say things \"differently\" but that \"decent people\" like Young and his wife are supporting Trump and his vision of change for the country. Ernst, an Iowan and a rising star in the party who is campaigning on behalf of Young in his Senate race against former Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) said that \"millions of Americans\" feel the same way that Trump does. She declined to defend or support Trump's refusal, saying she can't speak for the GOP nominee. \"I hope that the election is fair, I don<U+2019>t want to make any accusatory statements out there and I hope that if it is fair, that we accept that,\" Ernst said. \"He<U+2019>s trying to represent the majority of Americans out there. My hopes are that we do have a fair election.\" Later on Thursday, a spokeswoman for Ernst said that \"she believes that while we must always protect against voter fraud, there is no evidence of any effort to rig this election.\" Both said they missed Wednesday's debate anyway. Ernst said she was on a flight to Indiana <U+2014> and Young said he was reading. Everett reported from Washington. By Bill Scher By Joshua Zeitz By Thomas Wright By Jack Shafer",

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-trumps-education-pick-scares-unions-1480464943 \n text: After Donald Trump nominated Betsy DeVos to become education secretary, teachers union honcho Randi Weingarten tweeted: <U+201C>Trump has chosen the most ideological, anti-public ed nominee since the creation of the Dept of Education.<U+201D> Since what<U+2019>s good for the unions is often bad for the schools, and vice versa, Ms. Weingarten<U+2019>s apoplexy is reason to cheer. Ms. DeVos is chairwoman of the American Federation for Children, an organization dedicated to helping parents choose the best school for their kids. Ms. Weingarten leads the American Federation of Teachers, which is focused on what<U+2019>s best for the adults. Detractors say Ms. DeVos is opposed to public education. But she told an interviewer in 2013 that her definition of educational choice includes schools of all kinds. <U+201C>What we are trying to do is tear down the mindset that assigns students to a school based solely on the zip code of their family<U+2019>s home,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>We think of the educational choice movement as involving many parts: vouchers and tax credits, certainly, but also virtual schools, magnet schools, homeschooling, and charter schools.<U+201D> In the early 1990s, Ms. DeVos and her husband, a former president of Amway, were involved in passing Michigan<U+2019>s first charter-school bill. Ms. Weingarten brings a different set of priorities to the education debate. She has fought to keep persistently failing schools open because they still provide jobs for her dues-paying members. She has fought to ensure that government officials, rather than parents, decide where a child attends school. Union influence over education policy in the U.S. is unrivaled, and Ms. Weingarten prefers it that way. Her top concern is better pay and working conditions for her members. Students don<U+2019>t pay union dues. That doesn<U+2019>t make her a bad person, but it should cast doubt on claims, too often swallowed whole by education reporters, that union interests are perfectly aligned with those of students and families. A union-negotiated work rule that says teachers can<U+2019>t be evaluated by how much their students learn is a job-protection measure, but it obviously harms kids and school quality. Education philanthropists often work to accommodate the teachers unions. Ms. DeVos chose to fight them head on by backing political candidates who support school choice, the same way unions support candidates who don<U+2019>t. Michael Petrilli, a veteran of George W. Bush <U+2019>s Education Department who now runs the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, wrote last week that the DeVos pick shows Mr. Trump<U+2019>s seriousness. <U+201C>She was one of the first people in ed-reform to understand that we weren<U+2019>t going to beat the teachers unions with op-eds and policy papers,<U+201D> he wrote. <U+201C>She pushed the private school choice movement to invest in serious political giving much earlier than the mainstream reform groups did, and, so far, with far greater success.<U+201D> In the 2016 election, the American Federation for Children invested in 121 races in 12 states and won 89% of them. Mr. Trump clearly has tapped a fighter, and education reformers are thrilled. The school voucher program in Washington, D.C., that President Obama has spent two terms working to shut down<U+2014>at the urging of the unions, natch<U+2014>is likely to flourish under the new administration. Mr. Obama and his Education Department supported charter schools but not vouchers. Ms. DeVos embraces school choice writ large, and states interested in expanding educational options for low-income families will proceed knowing that Washington has their back. Mr. Obama tended to regulate what he couldn<U+2019>t legislate, and education policy was no exception. The administration imposed its will from Washington in areas traditionally left to the states<U+2014>from Common Core curriculum standards, to bathroom rules for transgender students, to race-based school discipline policies. With any luck Ms. DeVos will promptly end this meddling. Reformers are also hoping that the Trump administration learns from the past. To the dismay of many conservatives, George W. Bush greatly expanded the role of the federal government in K-12 schooling through the No Child Left Behind Act. Insisting that school districts break down test results by subgroup<U+2014>low income, special education, racial minorities<U+2014>increased transparency. But rewarding and punishing school districts based on yearly progress was overreach that even some who supported the law now regret. It legitimized a more muscular role in education for the feds. Mr. Trump has proposed a $20 billion federal voucher program that students could use to attend public or private schools. But this idea presents similar hazards. Federal dollars will bring federal regulations, and reform-minded individuals like Betsy DeVos won<U+2019>t forever be in charge of implementing them. Better to let the states lead on school choice. Now that Republicans control 33 governorships and both legislative chambers in 32 states, what<U+2019>s stopping them?",

When I see neo-Nazis raise their hands in terrifying solute, in public, in our nation<U+2019>s capital, I shudder in horror. When I see that action mildly rebuked by a boilerplate statement from the President-elect whom these bigots have praised, the anger in me grows. And when I see some in a pliant press turn that mild statement into what they call a denunciation I cannot hold back any longer. Our Declaration of Independence bequeaths us our cherished foundational principle: <U+201C>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.<U+201D> These truths may be self-evident but they are not self-replicating. Each generation has to renew these vows. This nation was founded as an opposite pole to the capriciousness of an authoritarian monarch. We set up institutions like a free press and an independent court system to protect our fragile rights. We have survived through bloody spasms of a Civil War and a Civil Rights Movement to extend more of these rights to more of our citizens. But the direction of our ship of state has not always been one of progress. We interned Japanese Americans, Red Baited during the McCarthy era, and more. I feel the rip tide of regression once again swelling under my feet. But I intend to remain standing. In normal times of a transition in our presidency between an incoming and outgoing administration of differing political parties, there is a certain amount of fretting on one side and gloating on the other. And the press usually takes a stance that the new administration at least deserves to have a chance to get started <U+2013> a honeymoon period. But these are not normal times. This is not about tax policy, health care, or education <U+2013> even though all those and more are so important. This is about racism, bigotry, intimidation and the specter of corruption. But as I stand I do not despair, because I believe the vast majority of Americans stand with me. To all those in Congress of both political parties, to all those in the press, to religious and civic leaders around the country. your voices must be heard. I hope that the President-elect can learn to rise above this and see the dangers that are brewing. If he does and speaks forcibly, and with action, we should be ready to welcome his voice. But of course I am deeply worried that his selections of advisors and cabinet posts suggests otherwise. To all of you I say, stay vigilant. The great Martin Luther King, Jr. knew that even as a minority, there was strength in numbers in fighting tyranny. Holding hands and marching forward, raising your voice above the din of complacency, can move mountains. And in this case, I believe there is a vast majority who wants to see this nation continue in tolerance and freedom. But it will require speaking. Engage in your civic government. Flood newsrooms or TV networks with your calls if you feel they are slipping into the normalization of extremism. Donate your time and money to causes that will fight to protect our liberties. We are a great nation. We have survived deep challenges in our past. We can and will do so again. But we cannot be afraid to speak and act to ensure the future we want for our children and grandchildren.",

Hillary Clinton has a slim three-point lead over Donald Trump one week before Election Day, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted entirely after FBI Director James Comey announced the discovery of new emails that might pertain to the former secretary of state's private server. Story Continued Below Clinton leads Trump 46 percent to 43 percent in a two-way race, and 42 percent to 39 percent in a four-way race, with Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson at 7 percent and the Green Party<U+2019>s Jill Stein at 5 percent. The poll was conducted using an online panel of 1,772 likely voters on Saturday and Sunday, beginning one day after Comey's announcement. The poll carries a margin or error of 2 percentage points. In a separate poll conducted before Comey's disclosure, Clinton was leading by three points in the four-way race, and five points in the two-way race. Put simply, there is not yet evidence that the revelations have drastically altered the contours of the election. Thirty-nine percent of voters said the additional review of emails in the Clinton case had no bearing on their vote in November, while 33 percent it made them much less likely to vote for Clinton. But most of those voters are already aligned against Clinton. Nearly two-thirds of Trump voters, 66 percent, said it makes them much less likely to vote against Clinton. Among the small pocket of undecided voters remaining, 42 percent said it made them less likely to vote for Clinton, including 30 percent who said it made them much less likely to vote for her. But just as many, 41 percent, said it makes no difference either way. \"It is unlikely that there will be a dramatic shift in the polls before Election Day,\" said Morning Consult cofounder and Chief Research Officer Kyle Dropp. \"While Friday's news may be considered an 'October Surprise,' it doesn't seem to be moving the needle as of now.\" Comey's vague letter to Congress, however, has shaken up the race for the White House. The FBI has reportedly seized the laptop, cell phone and iPad belonging to former Rep. Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin's estranged husband who has been accused of trading lewd text messages with a 15-year-old girl. Trump, who had already been gaining in the polls, has positioned the FBI's fresh involvement in the matter as a boon to his campaign. Clinton, meanwhile, has called on Comey to release all emails that were found. The Wall Street Journal Sunday reported the FBI needs to scour 650,000 emails found on Weiner's devices. As of Sunday night, it now has a warrant to do so. In the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, Weiner has an 8 percent approval rating, lower than Russia. Although Comey's announcement was just days ago, there's widespread awareness of what he did. Eighty-nine percent of respondents said they heard a lot or some about it. Forty-five percent of voters say they agree with Trump<U+2019>s claim that Clinton's email scandal is worse than Watergate. And asked to compare the two scandals, voters view Clinton's email issues and Trump's sexually aggressive comments about women as equally bad. The race for Congress appears to be very tight. When voters were asked if they would vote for a Republican or Democrat for Congress, 44 percent said they'd vote for the Democrat and 43 percent said they would vote for the Republican -- a big gain for the GOP. There's at least one overwhelming emotion about the election: Most everyone wishes it was over. Seventy-one percent of respondents said they strongly agree that they wish the election were finished already. Morning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides data-driven research and insights on politics, policy and business strategy.

The billionaire businessman who never before held elected office shocked America and the world, defeating Hillary Clinton in an extraordinary rebuke to the nation<U+2019>s political class after an ugly and divisive race that will go down as the most stunning upset in American history. Story Continued Below Trump did so decisively, stomping across the electoral map with wins in the four biggest battlegrounds of Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. He defied the polls and pundits after a scorched-earth campaign against Clinton, the Republican establishment, and basic decorum, toppling the blue wall of states that Clinton had supposedly constructed to keep the White House in Democratic hands. The nation, the markets and the world stood stunned, wondering what would come next. The Dow Futures sank as much as 750 points. The Mexico peso plunged. <U+201C>It is time for us to come together as one united people,<U+201D> Trump said in a victory speech, following a concession call from Clinton at nearly 3 a.m. Eastern. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s time.<U+201D> Trump led an unseen rebellion of working-class voters, most of them white and so disgusted by a stalled status quo that they voted for a candidate promising dramatic change, even as Trump set disapproval records for a winning candidate. He also tapped into ethnic antagonism, vowing strict immigration controls, a ban on Muslims and a deportation force, promising an era of restoration. <U+201C>The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,<U+201D> Trump declared. Off Message By Glenn Thrush Clinton had been heavily favored to win. She led national polls and in most battleground states heading into the election. Her allies were so confident that a supportive super PAC had actually redirected millions to other races. But Trump had been underestimated from the first day of his candidacy, when he descended the gilded escalators of Trump Tower to bash Mexican immigrants as <U+201C>rapists.<U+201D> He went on to dispatch 16 rivals in the Republican primary before mounting a vicious campaign against Clinton in which he paraded her husband<U+2019>s infidelities, repeatedly called her corrupt and questioned whether she could govern as a woman. For 17 months, the reality television showman mesmerized the public with his unvarnished tweets, constant television presence and raucous mass rallies. His full-throttle grip on the national imagination enriched the news media and eroded standards of political civility. It made him a hero to his fans. And they voted in droves. In Mahoning County, a longtime Democratic stronghold and the home of Youngstown, Ohio, Trump held Clinton to roughly 50 percent. President Obama had carried the county with 63.2 percent of the vote. That was the story in place after place, as Trump sliced deeply into once large Democratic margins and built massive leads among rural voters. <U+201C>This is a movement. It's more than a normal political election,<U+201D> said Sen. Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican who was the first GOP senator to endorse Trump in late February. <U+201C>It transcends normal party politics.<U+201D> For Clinton, the loss is especially brutal. She had meticulously planned her victory party at the Javits Center in Manhattan, symbolically under an enormous glass ceiling that she hoped to break through. Instead, it was the dreams and aspirations of her supporters that were shattered. By Kenneth P. Vogel and Alex Isenstadt Clinton<U+2019>s campaign chairman John Podesta said she was not ready to concede, calling for more votes to be counted. <U+201C>She<U+2019>s not done yet,<U+201D> he announced early Wednesday morning. But Clinton soon called Trump to concede. At the Javits Center, a mass of Democrats stood aghast on the convention center floor watching CNN and MSNBC. They cheered every time a small state was called for Clinton, but those times were few and far between. She won Colorado and Virginia, but little else that was competitive. Instead, they watched as state after state ticked into Trump<U+2019>s column, her chance of becoming the first woman president snatched away by a man caught on tape bragging about groping women, and then accused in recent weeks by a dozen of doing just that. They filed out without ever hearing her speak. Across town, at the Trump party, the buzz was building. It exploded when Fox News declared Ohio for Trump, the first swing state to fall. <U+201C>USA!<U+201D> came the chants from the crowd. Throughout his campaign, Trump made attacks on the <U+201C>dishonest media<U+201D> a centerpiece of his candidacy, becoming the first major candidate to refuse to release his tax returns. He avoided holding a press conference for the final three months of his candidacy. One thing was clear from early exit polls: the divisive contest had left many Americans deeply unsatisfied with their choice. More than three in five of those interviewed viewed Trump unfavorably, meaning many who did not approve of him voted for him anyway. <U+201C>[T]he idea of change trumped everything else,<U+201D> tweeted one of Trump<U+2019>s pollsters Tony Fabrizio. By Ben White Trump<U+2019>s strong showing was lifting Republicans down the ballot. In the Senate, Republicans scored a string of big victories. Sen. Marco Rubio won reelection in Florida, as did Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, Sen. Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania and Sen. Richard Burr in North Carolina, while the GOP also knocked back Democratic former Sen. Evan Bayh in Indiana. The only early loss was in Illinois, where Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth knocked off the incumbent. Trump will not only take the White House in 2017 but Republicans will control both chambers of Congress, where they have an appetite to unravel much of the progressive agenda enacted over the last eight years. The five-month campaign between Clinton and Trump had become a must-see spectacle for the nation, gripping the public consciousness and drawing record viewership to their three debates, where she was widely viewed to have outflanked him. In the final month, Trump battled back accusations of sexual assault after a tape emerged of him bragging about groping women in early October. In characteristic style, he lashed out as his accusers <U+2014> threatening to sue them in a speech at Gettysburg. Clinton called him <U+201C>temperamentally unfit<U+201D> for the presidency and accused him of embracing racist, xenophobic and misogynistic rhetoric. Donald Trump's full remarks on the election night. 11/09/16 04:24 AM EST But Clinton was weighed down by 18 months of questions about her use of a private-email server at the State Department, including an FBI investigation that seemingly concluded in July <U+2014> only to reemerge with 11 days left in the campaign. She was eventually cleared <U+2014> again <U+2014> of criminal wrongdoing only two days before the election. But Trump continued to cry foul about a <U+201C>rigged system<U+201D> tilted against his outsider candidacy, and has threatened to seek her imprisonment. <U+201C>Lock her up!<U+201D> has been the signature chant as his mass rallies. Trump struck a more conciliatory note in his speech on Wednesday, speaking of how it was time to <U+201C>bind the wounds of division.<U+201D> His upset victory is already sending shockwaves through financial markets. His idiosyncratic foreign policy views and his belief that the United States must be <U+201C>unpredictable<U+201D> in international affairs has sewn anxiety among allies and enemies alike. His regular compliments of Russian President Vladimir Putin have caused jitters across eastern Europe, ever-worried about Russian aggression. <U+201C>While we will always put America<U+2019>s interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone,<U+201D> Trump said.

Some former allies and observers say that after four years confined to the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, Mr. Assange is alienating former supporters and undermining WikiLeaks<U+2019> relevance. They cite a series of leaks that they say supported Russian efforts to disrupt the U.S. election and carelessly promoted Turkish government documents exposing the personal information of thousands of ordinary citizens. WikiLeaks <U+201C>has pioneered open government but has now gone off the rails in a way that damages the global transparency movement,<U+201D> said Alex Howard, a senior analyst at the Sunlight Foundation, a group once sympathetic to WikiLeaks that backs open-government efforts in the U.S. WikiLeaks<U+2019> relationship with Russia has come under particular scrutiny lately after the release of thousands of documents from the Democratic National Committee and allies of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. On Monday, WikiLeaks released a new batch of emails that it alleged were sent or received from John Podesta, a top campaign adviser for Mrs. Clinton. U.S. government officials have accused Russia of conducting those intrusions as part of an effort to influence the U.S. election. Computer-security firm Kaspersky Labs ZAO said another set of documents published on WikiLeaks, known as the Saudi Cables, most likely came from the same hackers who breached the DNC. There is no evidence of collusion between Russia and WikiLeaks, said Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley. <U+201C>However, Assange has made it very clear that he<U+2019>s willing to be a useful idiot for any intelligence service, as long as it furthers his own agenda,<U+201D> he said. The Ecuadorean government, in a statement late Tuesday explaining its decision, said that the country doesn<U+2019>t interfere in external electoral processes and so was temporarily restricting <U+201C>access to some of its private communication network<U+201D> within the embassy. WikiLeaks had earlier accused the Ecuadorean government of severing Mr. Assange<U+2019>s internet connection at the behest of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. A State Department spokesman on Tuesday rejected the assertion as false. Mr. Assange still exerts vast influence on the global debate. Others conducting their own disruptive document leaks follow a game plan Mr. Assange sketched out a decade ago. <U+201C>Consider what would happen if one of these [political] parties gave up their mobile phones, fax and email correspondence<U+2014>let alone the computer systems which manage their subscribers, donors, budgets, polling, call centers and direct mail Campaigns,<U+201D> Mr. Assange wrote when founding WikiLeaks in 2006. <U+201C>They would immediately fall into an organizational stupor and lose to the other.<U+201D> Representatives of WikiLeaks and Mr. Assange didn<U+2019>t respond to multiple requests to comment. WikiLeaks has long billed itself as a news organization. In its early days, it revealed documents ranging from secret Scientology manuals to the internal emails of climate researchers. But it became best known for information related to U.S. government policy. The emergence of alternative outlets for publishing such material makes Mr. Assange less central. Others published two of the most important leaks in recent years<U+2014>the Panama Papers documents taken from the Mossack Fonseca & Co. law firm and Edward Snowden <U+2019>s treasure trove of NSA documents. WikiLeaks once joined with major news organizations and used volunteers to purge personal information from data it published. But Mr. Assange later came to view former partners, including the New York Times and Britain<U+2019>s Guardian, as enemies after disputes over their handling of WikiLeaks material, former Assange confidant and ghostwriter Andrew O<U+2019>Hagan wrote in 2014. A Guardian representative said it last collaborated worked with WikiLeaks in 2010. Mr. O<U+2019>Hagan and New York Times representatives didn<U+2019>t respond to requests to comment. In July, Turkish human-rights activists criticized WikiLeaks for a Twitter message that linked to a cache of documents containing sensitive information belonging to private Turkish citizens. Some academics and activists also faulted the organization for including phone numbers, credit-card information and passport numbers in other data releases it published this year. Such actions have eroded WikiLeaks<U+2019> support among some advocates of transparency and privacy. <U+201C>Democratizing information has never been more vital, and @Wikileaks has helped. But their hostility to even modest curation is a mistake,<U+201D> said Mr. Snowden in a June Twitter message . Rainey Reitman, a co-founder of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which helps people donate to WikiLeaks, said publishers, including WikiLeaks, have a right to publish leaks but <U+201C>do have a responsibility to think through the privacy ramifications of everything they put up online.<U+201D> She noted that WikiLeaks doesn<U+2019>t conduct hacks itself, but publicizes material from hacks. Backers of Russian President Vladimir Putin have pointed to the DNC emails as evidence that the U.S. isn't as democratic as it seems. <U+201C>In America, there has been a gradual evaporation of democratic institutions, a seizure of power by the establishment,<U+201D> Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political commentator, said when asked about the hack of the DNC earlier this summer. <U+2014> James Marson in Moscow contributed to this article.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Dr. Edward F. Group III \n source: thesleuthjournal.com \n text: in: General Health , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests Everyone feels stress from time to time, but many of us are unaware of the fact that many commonly-experienced imbalances in health may actually be our body<U+2019>s way of responding to physical and mental stress. Recent scientific studies have indicated that the human body<U+2019>s reaction to stress could be one of the main causes of many life-threatening diseases, including heart disease and cancer. When we feel that we are in danger, a stress response surges through us and our bodies under-go an explosion of stress hormones that, over-time, are hazardous to our health. Ways Stress Negatively Affects Your Health 1. Increased Heart Rate When we enter into the fight or flight mode, the heart-rate naturally speeds up. While this may be a great thing if we need to run quickly, overtime this can significantly tire out the heart and lead to cardiovascular diseases, increased cholesterol and even excess belly fat . 2. Digestion Slows When we go into a state of stress, the energy needed for digestive processes is immediately sent to external areas of the body, such as the head, heart and limbs. This leads to a whole host of chronic stress-related digestive conditions. Chronic constipation and irritable bowel conditions are directly related, in many cases, to chronic stress. In fact, estimates show that as many as 20 percent of Americans experience chronic constipation and symptoms of IBS. Changes in appetite are also a stress-related condition. When we experience mental and emotional stress, we often reach for comfort foods to give us the false sensation of being calm. Similarly, some people react in the opposite way, losing their appetites when stress or anxiety levels are high. 3. High Blood Pressure Problems Studies show that when we are under stress, blood flow to the brain and muscles increase up to 400 percent. While this may be useful if we are planning on leaping into a tree, over time, chronic stress creates the scene for high blood pressure conditions or even a stroke. 4. Weight Gain Evidence shows that increased cortisol hormone levels caused by prolonged stress can lead to overall weight gain . 5. General Muscle Tension and Chronic Fatigue Muscles become tight when we are stressed. Because the muscles are constantly in a <U+201C>gripping<U+201D> state, they later become over-worked and leave us with a general sensation of body fatigue. Studies show that generalized back pain may also be a response to chronic stress-related muscle gripping along the spine. 6. Insomnia and Other Sleep-Conditions When the mind is continually spinning and stressing on the problems of life, it can be hard to unwind when the day is over. Insomnia is a sleep condition that is directly related to mental stress. 7. Reduced Happiness and Quality of Life Stress causes negative mental and emotional reactions. When we are stressed, it can be difficult for us to establish healthy social relationships, as we are constantly working to preserve personal stasis. 8. Immune Conditions Stress negatively effects the blood cells that aid in your body<U+2019>s ability to ward off infections, leading to greater likelihood of developing colds, flu and degenerative disorders. 9. Other Conditions Many modern studies are now linking the experience of chronic stress with a multitude of conditions. In fact, estimates show that up to two-thirds of all medical visits are for stress-induced conditions. Other stress-related conditions include depression, anxiety, migraine headaches, lack of sexual desire, chronic fatigue syndrome, IBS, immune disorders, memory loss, reproductive disorders, cold and flu conditions , skin imbalances such as acne, stunted growth and hair loss. On a Personal Note We all get stressed out at some point. It<U+2019>s inevitable and part of life. However, there are a few things you can do to help relieve stress, as well as stop it from coming in the first place. I recommend the following for stress relief: Exercise Daily",

The yield on Japan<U+2019>s 10-year government bond briefly rose above zero on Tuesday for the first time in nearly eight weeks , joining a global trend toward higher yields in the wake of Donald Trump <U+2019>s victory in the U.S. presidential election. The move up is significant because the bulk of Japan<U+2019>s government bonds have yielded a negative rate for most of the year, meaning investors pay the government for holding its debt. It also puts to the test an experimental new Bank of Japan policy that effectively keeps yields where it wants them by setting a target for 10-year government-bond yields at around zero, while keeping short-term rates negative. That means the central bank is likely to step in and buy bonds to push longer-term yields back down if they get too high, analysts and investors say. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s easy [for benchmark yields] to get to zero, but I believe the hurdle is fairly high for the yields to keep rising,<U+201D> said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions. Investors around the world are processing the possibility that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election victory could usher in a period of higher economic growth and inflation, ending an era of low and negative interest rates that fueled a yearslong rally in government bonds. Inflation chips away at the value of fixed payments in the future, making bonds less attractive to hold. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasurys shot up to as high as 2.30% on Monday, versus 1.867% on Nov. 8, when the U.S. presidential election was held, marking one of its sharpest jumps over a similar period since 2008. The yield was at 2.29% on Tuesday morning in New York, near its highest level since January. In Germany, yields on 10-year bunds rose to their highest level since late January on Monday, while the yield on the Swiss 10-year government bond almost moved into positive territory from negative. Yields on both bonds eventually settled lower on Monday and continued to fall on Tuesday. Many emerging markets have seen even bigger bond selloffs as rising yields in the developed world make the debt of riskier countries less attractive. In Malaysia, where foreigners own roughly half of government bonds, yields were at 4.198% late Tuesday versus 3.662% on Nov. 8. In Indonesia, which pulled in some of the biggest inflows of cash in this year<U+2019>s rush to emerging markets, yields rose to 7.922% late Tuesday, compared with 7.372% on Election Day. In Japan, which has been experimenting with zero rates and aggressive easing since 1999 in an attempt to get its stagnant economy growing strongly again, yields in the $10 trillion government-bond market have been moving much more slowly. The 10-year government-bond yield has crept from minus-0.07% just before Mr. Trump<U+2019>s win, and rose above zero to 0.005% during Tuesday trading in Tokyo, before falling to around zero. The last time the benchmark had traded briefly above zero was Sept. 21, just after the BOJ announced its plan to keep those yields around 0%. The BOJ implemented the plan to try to increase the effectiveness of its monetary policy and lessen its impact on banks by keeping a sizable gap between short- and long-term rates<U+2014>the spread on which most lenders earn their profits. But the policy also works to shield Japanese yields from external pushes and pulls, and may be one reason Japanese government bonds have been slow to join the global move. Now investors are wondering how high the BOJ might let longer-term yields rise, and whether it can really exert the control on the massive market that it wants. <U+201C>The test will be whether the BOJ increases purchases to maintain its line in the sand,<U+201D> said Charlie Diebel, head of rates at Aviva Investors in London, which managed assets worth more than <U+00A3>318 billion ($397 billion) as of June 30. Many investors are betting that, for now, the BOJ will let benchmark yields rise<U+2014>potentially to as high as 0.1%. Some say the BOJ<U+2019>s task won<U+2019>t be too difficult, because there are plenty of Japanese investors waiting to snap up government bonds once returns go up. <U+201C>The BOJ is letting go,<U+201D> said Naka Matsuzawa, Japan rates strategist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo. <U+201C>They are simply going to let the market do what they need to do.<U+201D> Still, investors globally are watching whether the BOJ will buy bonds aggressively to tame rates<U+2014>especially at a time when other central banks could tighten policy. Most investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December, while speculation has mounted that the European Central Bank could soon scale back its asset purchases. <U+201C>At some point buying will likely kick in, and investors will watch closely at what level the BOJ carries out [fixed-rate JGB purchase] operations,<U+201D> said Takahiro Iizuka, vice president of the treasury department at Mizuho Trust & Banking. <U+2014>Kosaku Narioka and Christopher Whittall contributed to this article.

Michigan, once viewed as essentially out of reach for the Republican presidential nominee, has resurfaced as a closely contested battleground . The presidential candidates and their A-list surrogates are fanning out across the state, making it one of their last stops as they sprint toward the finish. Mr. Trump campaigned<U+00A0>Sunday night<U+00A0>in this Detroit suburb, predicting a win in Michigan and declaring, <U+201C>the unions love me.<U+201D> <U+201C>The economic policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton have bled Michigan dry,<U+201D> he told a massive crowd at an outdoor amphitheater. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s running mate, Mike Pence, has scheduled two campaign events in Michigan on Monday. Meantime, both Mrs. Clinton and President Barack Obama plan to campaign separately Monday in the state. Polls still show Mrs. Clinton with a single-digit edge there, but Mr. Trump has gained ground during the last couple of weeks. On Sunday, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus characterized Michigan as <U+201C> an absolute tossup .<U+201D> <U+201C>When you look at a place like Michigan, where jobs have gone to Mexico and China and people are out of work and people want things to get better, I think Donald Trump is offering that vision for the state of Michigan,<U+201D> Mr. Priebus told ABC. In a state with a large share of white, working-class voters, the Trump campaign sees an opportunity to score an upset and expand the New York businessman<U+2019>s narrow path to the White House. With African-American turnout lagging in early voting in some other parts of the country, Mrs. Clinton is redoubling efforts to turn out her base in a state that has voted for Democrats in the last six presidential elections. And after being blindsided by Sen. Bernie Sanders<U+2019> upset win in Michigan during the Democratic primaries, the Clinton campaign isn<U+2019>t taking this state for granted. But with limited absentee voting ahead of Election Day in Michigan, the two campaigns have fewer tea leaves to read here than in other states that have much broader parameters for early voting. John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign chairman, said Sunday that if the former secretary of state keeps Michigan and Nevada in her column, she would win the White House. <U+201C>We feel like we got a lead in Michigan,<U+201D> he told NBC. <U+201C>We want to hold on to it, and we think we can do that.<U+201D> <U+2014>David Harrison contributed to this article.

Though incoming leader Chuck Schumer has yet to show his hand, the outline of a Democratic strategy for dealing with Donald Trump is beginning to take shape, based on interviews with several senators and aides. Their thinking: Exploit the inevitable divisions between Trump and the increasingly conservative GOP leadership over tax policy, infrastructure spending and possibly social issues. And Senate Democrats hope to use the filibuster <U+2014> the only real leverage they have to stymie Trump and congressional Republicans <U+2014> sparingly. Story Continued Below While it might seem like wishful thinking for Democrats to think they can do an end run around a Congress firmly under Republican control, Democrats say they could envision cutting deals with Trump on passing a public works package, killing the <U+201C>carried interest<U+201D> loophole, and cracking down on currency manipulation by China. Many conservatives oppose all those proposals. So even as progressives dig in to fight potential efforts to repeal Obamacare and hack away at environmental regulations, party leaders appear open to working with Trump <U+2014> on their terms. <U+201C>We must hold him to his words [of promising to close] tax loopholes that only help the rich [and] unrig the system,<U+201D> said Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a close ally of Schumer who<U+2019>s poised to rise in Democratic leadership. <U+201C>The problem in getting infrastructure is not the Democratic caucus.<U+201D> <U+201C>I think Donald Trump would be very receptive to what [moderate Democrats] have to say,<U+201D> added Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. By Gabriel Debenedetti Schumer has kept a low profile since the election. He released a statement after speaking with Trump that he would spend time reflecting on <U+201C>charting a path forward to achieve our shared goals and to defend our values.<U+201D> Schumer has also been in touch with senators from across his caucus, hoping to zero in on policy areas of agreement with Trump that congressional Republicans might oppose. But Democrats in contact with Schumer say the presumptive Democratic leader hasn<U+2019>t given them any indication he<U+2019>s planning to declare war on the incoming president by reflexively opposing him on everything. That<U+2019>s in keeping with Schumer<U+2019>s pragmatic, deal-cutting sensibilities. Schumer chatted with Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-Ky.) on Election Day and the two agreed to work together <U+201C>whatever happens<U+201D> in the presidential race, a person familiar with the exchange said. They spoke again on Wednesday. And in Louisville on Friday, McConnell called Schumer a <U+201C>smart, transactional person, and I think we<U+2019>ll get along just fine.<U+201D> But the hope within Schumer<U+2019>s inner circle is that Trump will move toward the center and occasionally go around McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to negotiate with the incoming Democratic leader. <U+201C>There are areas where [Trump] is much more of a Democrat,<U+201D> said a senior Democratic aide. <U+201C>He could cut deals and leave [Republicans] in the dust.<U+201D> Schumer and his likely 48-member minority will have an intensely difficult task the next two years: Protecting 10 Senate Democrats up for reelection in states Trump carried with a progressive base that will demand the party confront Trump at every turn. By Daniel Strauss It's a microcosm of the post-election crisis facing Democrats of how to appeal to people who voted for Trump even as the party marches steadily to the left. <U+201C>We will be the only bulwark against Trumpism,<U+201D> said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), a progressive Democrat. Schumer is <U+201C>the leader we need right now to be the only check on Trump.<U+201D> Likely relegated to the minority until at least 2020, given the brutal midterm map in two years, Senate Democrats are in a reactive, wait-and-see mode. But even the most liberal members of the Senate seem to believe it would be a mistake to promise four years of obstruction out of the gate. Automatic opposition to Trump<U+2019>s agenda could backfire. With the White House and Congress under GOP control, Republicans could retaliate by killing the filibuster altogether. <U+201C>What we<U+2019>re not going to do is what Mitch McConnell stands for, which is obstructing things because of who proposed it,<U+201D> said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), a prominent liberal. But <U+201C>if Trump puts plans forward that aren<U+2019>t about working Americans, if it<U+2019>s tax cuts for billionaires, we<U+2019>ll certainly fight that.<U+201D> The first real inflection point for Democrats will be Trump<U+2019>s Supreme Court nominee. The expectation is that McConnell will stick with the 60-vote standard, unless Democrats bait him to change it by blocking the nominee, which Merkley admitted is a possibility. <U+201C>I hope that what<U+2019>s going to happen is we don't do that,<U+201D> Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said of a rules change. <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve already received some calls from Democrats wanting to work together to resolve this issue.<U+201D> By Cristiano Lima Schumer will be under intense pressure from liberals to oppose any conservative nominee. But moderate Democrats and those up for reelection in Rust Belt states that Trump won could conceivably help McConnell get 60 votes. At least eight Democrats will be needed to break a filibuster. <U+201C>He won the White House and that is part of the deal. He<U+2019>s going to restore the balance,<U+201D> said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who was in strong opposition to Trump during the election. <U+201C>When you look at the number of Democrats that are up, I think we<U+2019>ll get cooperation.<U+201D> Flake wouldn<U+2019>t say how Republicans would react to such a filibuster, and McConnell declined to entertain a possible rules change, saying Friday that Democrats are <U+201C>going to want to be cooperative with us.<U+201D> For now, the GOP seems to be leaning toward keeping the legislative filibuster and the required cooperation with Democrats that comes with it. <U+201C>Republicans ought to be consistent here,<U+201D> Flake said. <U+201C>The legislative filibuster is something that has helped maintain limited government.<U+201D> With their options limited in taking on Trump and the congressional GOP, Democrats are laying out areas on which they think they can work with the new president. Rather than coming out of the gate as an aggressive opposition party, they<U+2019>re looking for clues whether Trump is interested in engaging with them. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s really going to be on President Trump to follow through on his priorities,<U+201D> Stabenow said. But if he doesn<U+2019>t? <U+201C>It<U+2019>s a fight,<U+201D> Schatz said. By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

Martin Melchor, a 52-year-old housekeeper in Las Vegas, became a U.S. citizen 19 years ago but says he never voted before Tuesday. He said he was motivated to vote for the first time because of some of the <U+201C>bad things<U+201D> he heard from Mr. Trump.<U+00A0><U+201C>I cannot let him win,<U+201D> Mr. Melchor said. <U+201C>Sometimes we say we don<U+2019>t think we need to vote, but now we need to vote because it<U+2019>s going to affect our families.<U+201D> In North Miami Beach, Maria del Consuelo Torrealba, a 49-year-old Venezuelan immigrant who became a U.S.<U+00A0>citizen last year, voted for the first time as an American<U+00A0>on Tuesday. She said she cast a ballot for the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. <U+201C>She offers many opportunities and defends women,<U+201D> said Ms. Torrealba, a babysitter registered as a Democrat. She said she found<U+00A0>Mr. Trump deeply offensive. <U+201C>He has spoken very badly about women and immigrants,<U+2019><U+2019> she said. In North Carolina, Quanisha Robinson, a 19-year-old Hispanic freshman at Shaw University in Raleigh, said she was eager to cast her first ballot for Mrs. Clinton. <U+201C>She<U+2019>s the best for right now,<U+201D> Ms. Robinson said. But she said she was even more excited to vote against Mr. Trump. <U+201C>Being Hispanic, he<U+2019>s inconsiderate in what he says. It<U+2019>s hurtful,<U+201D> she said. In Houston, Laura Cantu, 37, a caretaker and mother, said her fear of a Trump presidency galvanized her to vote for the first time. <U+201C>I just don<U+2019>t want to see someone tear us down as far as Trump will,<U+201D> said Ms. Cantu, who voted for Mrs. Clinton, despite having reservations about the Democratic nominee as well. <U+201C>Trust me, I didn<U+2019>t want to vote for either of them.<U+201D> In Arizona, a coalition of 14 interfaith, labor and other grass-roots organizations, One Arizona, has been mobilizing immigrant and Hispanic voters for months in the largest registration and get-out-the-vote effort the state has ever seen, analysts say. One Arizona says it registered 150,000 new voters since January, the majority of them Latino. About 710,000 Latinos, an unprecedented number, are now registered to vote in the border state out of about one million who are eligible, meaning they are U.S. citizens 18 years of age or older. One Arizona counted on youngsters like Gina Mendez to mobilize fellow Hispanics, knocking on doors of homes in working-class neighborhoods of Phoenix and approaching strangers as they emerged from stores or in parking lots. <U+201C>We were registering people in front of grocery stores, schools and gas stations,<U+201D> said the 25-year-old, U.S.-born daughter of Mexican immigrants. She said this year Latinos are motivated by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s tough<U+00A0>talk on immigration, his pledge to build a wall along the southern border and negative comments about Mexicans. Not all first-time Latino voters were Hillary supporters. In-care home provider Ron Ayala came out to the polls in Los Angeles on Tuesday for the first time to cast a vote for Donald Trump. <U+201C>He wants change,\" said Mr. Ayala, 39, who identifies as Latino. Mr. Ayala says he views the president as a figurehead, and that it<U+2019>s the people around the president who matter. He thinks Mr. Trump will put the right people in place. <U+201C>It doesn<U+2019>t matter what Trump says, what I care about is what<U+2019>ll be done for this country,<U+201D> <U+00A0>he said, adding that creating new jobs and boosting the economy are his top concerns. <U+2014>Miriam Jordan in Phoenix; Alexandra Berzon in Las Vegas; Sara Randazzo in Los Angeles; Erin Ailworth in Houston; Valerie Bauerlein in Raleigh, N.C.; and Arian Campo-Flores in Miami contributed to this article.",

Earlier this year, WikiLeaks released emails showing that the Democratic National Committee had maliciously conspired to undermine the presidential campaign of Clinton challenger, Senator Bernie Sanders, in order to elevate Hillary Clinton to the top of the ticket. \nNow it has emerged that two of the top lawyers representing Assange, John Jones in London and Michael Ratner in New York, died within less than a month of each other this year. And, Assange<U+2019>s closest confidant in London and a Director of WikiLeaks, Gavin Macfadyen, died just yesterday. \nWall Street On Parade has carefully investigated the similarly unprecedented banker deaths over the past two and one half years. What is noteworthy about the banker deaths is that at the time of the deaths, Wall Street banks and their global brethren were under the largest investigations for criminal rigging of markets to occur in the past century. Even during the Senate investigations of the early 1930s when crooked business journalists touting fraudulent Wall Street stocks and crooked Wall Street bank execs manipulating stock prices were regularly revealed through subpoenaed documents, there was no similar rash of deaths or series of alleged suicides. (See related articles below.) \nNow there is WikiLeaks leaking emails and documents that show that the same kind of cartel-like behavior that has corrupted Wall Street to its core has also infested the top of the Democratic Party. And, amazingly, three key members of the Assange/WikiLeaks support network have died within six months of each other this year. The statistical probability of this being a natural occurrence is slim.

Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. <U+201C>ObamaCare was never designed *not* to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs,<U+201D> points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldn<U+2019>t come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people. A series of videos that emerged in 2014 featured Gruber admitting that Obamacare was deceptively crafted in order to fool <U+201C>stupid<U+201D> Americans into not realizing that it would mean massive price hikes and that the law<U+2019>s <U+201C>lack of transparency (was) a huge political advantage<U+201D> in selling it.",

Renowned Harvard Psychologist Says ADHD is Largely a Fraud Viewed by academics as one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century, Jerome Kagan r... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/renowned-harvard-psychologist-says-adhd.html Viewed by academics as one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century, Jerome Kagan ranked above Carl Jung (the founder of analytical psychology) and Ivan Pavlov (who discovered the Pavlovian reflex) in a 2002 American Psychological Association ranking of the eminent psychologists. He is well-known for his pioneering work in developmental psychology at Harvard University, where he has spent decades documenting how babies and small children grow, and is an exceptional and highly-regarded researcher.So it may be surprising to learn that he believes the diagnosis of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is an invention <U+2014> and only benefits the pharmaceutical industry and psychiatrists. Mislabeling Mental Illness <U+201C>That is the history of humanity: Those in authority believe they<U+2019>re doing the right thing, and they harm those who have no power,<U+201D> says Jerome Kagan.In an interview with Spiegel, Kagan addressed the skyrocketing rates of ADHD in America , which he attributes to <U+201C>fuzzy diagnostic practices.<U+201D> He illustrated his point with the following example:Say fifty years ago you have a 7-year-old who is bored in school and exhibits disruptive behavior. Back then, he would be labeled as lazy. But today, that same child is said to suffer from ADHD . That<U+2019>s why we<U+2019>ve seen such a dramatic increase in the disorder.Every child who is having problems in school is sent to see a pediatrician, who then claims it<U+2019>s ADHD and prescribes Ritalin . <U+201C>In fact, 90 percent of these 5.4 million kids don<U+2019>t have an abnormal dopamine metabolism. The problem is, if a drug is available to doctors, they<U+2019>ll make the corresponding diagnosis,<U+201D> he said.<U+201C>We could get philosophical and ask ourselves: <U+201C>What does mental illness mean?<U+201D> If you do interviews with children and adolescents aged 12 to 19, then 40 percent can be categorized as anxious or depressed. <U+201C>But if you take a closer look and ask how many of them are seriously impaired by this, the number shrinks to 8 percent. Describing every child who is depressed or anxious as being mentally ill is ridiculous. <U+201C>Adolescents are anxious, that<U+2019>s normal. They don<U+2019>t know what college to go to. Their boyfriend or girlfriend just stood them up. Being sad or anxious is just as much a part of life as anger or sexual frustration,<U+201D> Kagan told Spiegel.What are the implications for the millions of American children who are inaccurately diagnosed as mentally ill? Kagan believes it<U+2019>s devastating because they think there is something fundamentally wrong with them. He<U+2019>s not the only psychologist to raise the alarm about this trend, but Kagan and others feel they<U+2019>re up against <U+201C>an enormously powerful alliance: pharmaceutical companies that are making billions , and a profession that is self-interested.<U+201D>Kagan himself suffered from inner restlessness and stuttering as a child, but his mother told him: <U+201C>There<U+2019>s nothing wrong with you. Your mind is working faster than your tongue.<U+201D>He thought at the time: <U+201C>Gee, that<U+2019>s great, I<U+2019>m only stuttering because I<U+2019>m so smart.<U+201D> If he had been born in the present era, he most likely would have been classified as mentally ill.ADHD isn<U+2019>t the only mental illness epidemic among children that worries Kagan, depression is another. In 1987, about one in 400 American teenagers was using an antidepressant. By 2002, the numbers leaped to one in 40. He feels it<U+2019>s another overused diagnosis, simply because the pills are available. Instead of immediately resorting to pharmaceutical drugs, he thinks doctors should take more time with the child to find out why they aren<U+2019>t as cheerful, for instance. At the very least, a few tests should be carried out <U+2014> and an EEG for certain, especially since studies have shown that people who have heightened activity in the right frontal lobe respond poorly to antidepressants.Kagan remembers going into a textbook-type depression after a major research project he was involved with failed. He had insomnia and met all the other clinical criteria for depression. But since he knew what the cause was, he didn<U+2019>t seek professional help. After six months, the depression was gone. Under normal circumstances, he would have been diagnosed as mentally ill by a psychiatrist and put on medication.

Ryan as speaker and greet Hillary Clinton with a fresh round of investigations <U+2014> whether she wins the White House or not. Some members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus met privately on Wednesday to discuss agitating for more clout, which could take the form of a challenge to Mr. Ryan, or a call for rules changes that the speaker is likely to oppose. And there are no signs that the good will that often accompanies the arrival of a new president will again take hold. <U+201C>I hate to be gloomy, but it doesn<U+2019>t strike me as probably helping make politics more functional than it is,<U+201D> said John Sides, a professor of political science at George Washington University. <U+201C>It seems to me that a pretty likely outcome of the election is divided government, and that may make politics seem pretty similar to what we<U+2019>ve had for the past several years.<U+201D> Going into the final weekend of campaigning, Republicans are expected to keep their hold on the House, but with a narrower majority than the one they hold now, which is their largest since the 1930s. Nonpartisan analysts are forecasting that Democrats will pick up five to 20 seats next week, well shy of the 30 needed to retake control. In recent weeks, Republicans have begun to present themselves as a necessary check on Mrs. Clinton, should she be elected, arguing that they cannot advance their agenda without at least a House majority. <U+201C>She could come in with a Democrat Congress, the worst of all possible things, if Republicans do not turn out and do not vote,<U+201D> Mr. Ryan said on Tuesday in an interview with Fox News. A Republican-controlled House is expected to continue to enthusiastically embrace its role as watchdog on Mrs. Clinton, regardless of the outcome of the presidential race. Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , on Thursday offered a lengthy list of continuing investigative targets from Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s time as the secretary of State. <U+201C>Win or lose, we still have to examine and help clean up the mess that she created at the State Department,<U+201D> he said. In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security , said the House would pursue impeachment proceedings against Mrs. Clinton should a new federal investigation into her use of a private email server look likely to lead to an indictment. But Mr. Chaffetz pushed back against that assertion. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m not operating this investigation with the end predetermined. So any talk of impeachment is much too premature,<U+201D> Mr. Chaffetz said. <U+201C>In fact, I think it<U+2019>s destructive to the process to suggest that that<U+2019>s going to happen. We don<U+2019>t know because we don<U+2019>t have all the facts yet.<U+201D> Moderate Republicans are most at risk in next week<U+2019>s election. Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, expressed optimism that his fellow moderates will prevail, but if they lose, he said, it could be more difficult for the House to deal with pressing matters such as tax reform or an overhaul of the nation<U+2019>s infrastructure. <U+201C>There is the potential for a smaller, pragmatic and governing wing of the Republican Party ,<U+201D> Mr. Dent said. But some members of the Freedom Caucus seem to have another agenda in mind. They strategized behind closed doors on Wednesday about how to press for their priorities during the lame-duck session, as well as under a potential President Donald J. Trump, aides said. They also have been weighing rules changes they would like to see <U+2014> within the party and for the House as a whole <U+2014> largely intended to empower members with responsibilities typically reserved for leadership, including the selection of committee chairpersons. There is no need to clash with House leaders so long as their proposed changes are <U+201C>considered fairly,<U+201D> said Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland and a member of the Freedom Caucus, who did not attend Wednesday<U+2019>s meeting. <U+201C>I think that would involve a fair discussion of the issues,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>I think that would involve a feeling that leadership is not putting its finger on the scale. Take a vote, and let the chips fall where they may.<U+201D> Members of the caucus are also concerned about a push from more moderate Republicans to toss out the so-called motion to vacate the chair, a procedural move through which a single member can force a vote to remove the speaker. One member of the Freedom Caucus, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, tried to use it to oust John A. Boehner from his speakership last year, prompting many <U+2014> including Mr. Ryan <U+2014> to criticize it. Mr. Harris also cautioned there could be repercussions for those who had not fully supported Mr. Trump, should he lose. Such frustration has largely been directed at Mr. Ryan after his decision to no longer defend or campaign with Mr. Trump. But many caucus members, including Mr. Harris, have said they would be open to voting for Mr. Ryan again during leadership elections on Nov. 15. Their latest discussions <U+2014> and the fact that a narrower Republican majority would mean Mr. Ryan could afford to lose fewer votes to retain his speakership <U+2014> have raised the prospect that the group could resort to political hostage-taking to fulfill their demands. Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and chairman of the Freedom Caucus, declined to say Thursday whether Mr. Ryan should remain as speaker. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s a question for down the road,<U+201D> he said during an interview with CNBC. Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, said he did not believe Mr. Ryan<U+2019>s speakership was in danger. But if it was, he said, there would be pushback from other Republicans. <U+201C>People can always try that,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>But it doesn<U+2019>t work well to put a gun to the head of your own teammates and say, <U+2018>this is a negotiation.<U+2019><U+201D> Correction: November 5, 2016 Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the campaign for control of the House of Representatives erroneously attributed a distinction to congressional Republicans. The Republicans hold the largest congressional majority for their party since the 1930s, not for either party.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Farhad Manjoo \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/trump-election-silicon-valley-reels.html?_r=0 \n text: Silicon Valley<U+2019>s luminaries woke up Wednesday morning to a darkened new global order, one that the ceaseless optimism of their tech-powered visions seemed suddenly unable to conquer. Across the technology industry, the reaction to Donald J. Trump<U+2019>s election to the presidency was beyond grim. There was a sense that the industry had missed something fundamental about the fears and motivations of the people who use its products, and that the miscalculation would cost the industry, and the world, greatly. <U+201C>The horror, the horror,<U+201D> said Shervin Pishevar, a venture capitalist at the firm Sherpa Capital who, like just about every leading light in tech, had strongly supported Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s candidacy. <U+201C>We didn<U+2019>t do enough,<U+201D> he added. <U+201C>There were too many people in the tech industry who were complacent. They waited and waited and waited to get engaged in this election. And now we have this nightmare.<U+201D> Others were more succinct in their devastation. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m heartbroken,<U+201D> said Stewart Butterfield, co-founder of the corporate messaging service Slack. For some, buried in the visceral reaction was also a realization that the tech industry<U+2019>s relationship with government <U+2014> not to mention the public <U+2014> looks bound to shift in a fundamental way. During the Obama years, Silicon Valley came to see itself as the economic and social engine of a new digital century. Smartphones and social networks became as important to world business as oil and the automobile, and Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft rose to become some of the most prosperous and valuable companies on the planet. Mr. Obama, who rode many of these digital tools to the presidency, was accommodative of their rise; his administration broadly deferred to the tech industry in a way that bordered on coziness , and many of his former lieutenants have decamped to positions in tech. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s win promises to rip apart that relationship. The incoming president had few kind words for tech giants during the interminable campaign that led to his victory. Mr. Trump promised to initiate antitrust actions against Amazon, repeatedly vowed to force Apple to make its products in the United States, and then called for a boycott of the company when it challenged the government<U+2019>s order to unlock a terrorist<U+2019>s iPhone. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s immigration plans are anathema to just about every company in tech. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft offered no immediate comment about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s win, or how the new administration<U+2019>s stated policy goals would affect their businesses. But it seems clear that a shift is in the offing. Leaders of these behemoths have long spoken in ambitious, gauzy sentimentalities about a broadly progressive future. Their goals weren<U+2019>t simply financial but, they said, philosophical and democratic <U+2014> they wanted to make money, sure, but they also wanted to make the world a better place, to offer a kind of social justice through code. Theirs was a tomorrow powered by software instead of factories, and offering a kind of radical connectivity that they promised would lead to widespread peace and prosperity. Last year, Sundar Pichai, Google<U+2019>s chief executive, published a broad rebuke of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plan to ban Muslims from immigrating to the United States. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook<U+2019>s co-founder and chief executive, told an audience of developers in April that <U+201C>instead of building walls, we can help people build bridges.<U+201D> In private, during the campaign, many tech leaders were positive that their vision would prevail over Mr. Trump<U+2019>s. When asked about whether they were preparing in any way for a Trump victory, bigwigs at many of the industry<U+2019>s leading tech and financial firms were bemused by the notion. They thought it would never happen. The deeper worry is that tech is out of step with the national and global mood, and failed to recognize the social and economic anxieties roiling the nation <U+2014> many of them hastened by the products the industry devises. Among techies, there is now widespread concern that Facebook and Twitter have hastened the decline of journalism and the irrelevance of facts . Social networks seem also to have contributed to a rise in the kind of trolling, racism and misogyny that characterized so much of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign. And then you get to the economic problems. Unlike previous economic miracles, the tech boom has not led to widespread employment. Much of the wealth generated by the five biggest American tech companies flows to young liberals in California and the Pacific Northwest, exactly the sort of <U+201C>global elites<U+201D> Mr. Trump railed against in his campaign. It<U+2019>s not clear that most Americans see technological progress as the unalloyed good that it is considered in Silicon Valley. Technology has pushed so deeply into people<U+2019>s lives, changing how they work and go to school and raise their children, that it could well raise more fears than hopes. A new smartphone is nice, but perhaps not if it means that your trucking job will be replaced by a big rig that drives itself . <U+201C>We need to figure out how to connect more Americans to the economic engine of technology,<U+201D> said John Lilly, a partner at the venture capital firm Greylock Partners. On Wednesday, some in Silicon Valley worried about their disconnection from the mass of voters who chose Mr. Trump. <U+201C>In tech, we need scale, so we look at the world through the lens of aggregate metrics like page views, active users and even revenue,<U+201D> Danielle Morrill, the chief executive of a start-up called Mattermark, wrote in an email. <U+201C>But that doesn<U+2019>t mean we understand the people on the other side of the screen as individuals. That<U+2019>s the danger, and the opportunity.<U+201D> Still, some people in tech said that despite their heartache over the outcome, they felt renewed inspiration to take bolder action to realize their progressive visions. Some made very big, idealistic proposals <U+2014> this being, after all, the land of disruption. On Twitter, for instance, Mr. Pishevar said he would fund a campaign to get California to secede from the nation. Others weren<U+2019>t as high-flying, but were nevertheless resolute. Aaron Levie, the chief executive of Box, an online document storage company, suggested that the tech industry promote specific policy issues. <U+201C>To shift to an economy driven by innovation from tech-enabled businesses, we need to get ahead on the issues we<U+2019>ve been talking about in Silicon Valley for years, like education, patent reform and immigration reform,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>By and large, minus taxes and some tax repatriation issues, much about Trump<U+2019>s rhetoric has been antithetical to most of the big businesses that are driving the economy.<U+201D> Mark Suster, a venture capitalist at Upfront Ventures, echoed the idea. <U+201C>Tech needs to take a deep breath, and then reflect on how this happened,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>And have policy proposals that can realistically address the inequality in our country.<U+201D> Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com Katie Benner contributed reporting.

Quietly but constantly in the background of the entire Obama Administration, the Federal Reserve<U+2019>s stimulus program that combined unlimited QE with zero percent interest rates has absolutely wrecked this country and its economic stability. \nThe system as we know it cannot be sustained. Yellen and co. have been simply waiting for the right time to let the other shoe drop <U+2013> namely, after it could influence the election even further in the direction of Trump<U+2019>s populist uprising. Unfortunately, he will now be largely blamed for the great destruction that is scheduled to fall upon this nation. In fact, that is the very reason that Brandon Smith of Alt-Market.com attributed to Trump<U+2019>s victory when he predicted his election many months ago. \nSomething big is coming<U+2026> prepare yourselves accordingly. \nHow Alt-Market Predicted Trump<U+2019>s Win Months in Advance: <U+201C>He won because the elites WANT HIM THERE, the global economy WILL collapse<U+201D> \nby Melissa Dykes\nWhile many of us in the alternative media and especially those researchers of Clinton crimes are breathing a big fat sigh of relief that anybody but Hillary is headed to the White House in 2017, Brandon Smith of Alt Market is warning us all not to get too comfortable<U+2026> and with history on his side here, we should listen to him.\nDespite what looked like a rigged, fraudulent Hillary win orchestrated from the top down with the entire establishment machine behind her, Trump won the election. In an election year that would have otherwise seen record low voter turnout, the specter of Hillary that led to Trump<U+2019>s victory has now given the people a reason to believe their vote actually matters again, an extra boon to further relegitimize the corrupt system running things in this country.\nBut Smith reminds us that if Trump is walking into the Oval Office in January, it is only because the elites decided to put him there in advance <U+2014> and for a reason.\nFirst it should be noted that Smith accurately predicted that Brexit would pass , even when the majority of the alt media was reporting that there was no way it possibly could. Was it another victory for the people?\nNo, it was predetermined well in advance:\n<U+201C>The mainstream media has been consistently comparing Trump supporters to Brexit supporters, and Trump himself has hitched his political wagon to the Brexit. This fits perfectly with the globalist narrative that populists and conservatives are killing the global economy and placing everyone at risk. <U+201C>\nThen he accurately predicted a Trump win <U+2026> but not because voting actually matters:\n<U+201C>U.S. elections are indeed controlled, and have been for decades, primarily through the false left/right paradigm. However, as I have been pointing out since I correctly predicted the success of the Brexit referendum, I don<U+2019>t think that Clinton is the choice of the elites.<U+201D>\n<U+201C>To be clear, my position is that Trump is slated to take the White House and that this is by design. This has been my position since before Trump won the Republican Primaries, it was my position when the election cycle began, it has never changed, nor have my views on the reasons for this outcome ever changed<U+2026><U+201D>\nSmith says regardless of whether or not Trump is a legitimate anti-establishment candidate, his win means the global economic collapse the system has been holding off on will finally come to pass <U+2014> as planned <U+2014> under Trump<U+2019>s watch:\n<U+201C><U+2026>Even if Trump is a legitimate anti-establishment conservative, his entry into the Oval Office will seal the deal on the economic collapse, and will serve the globalists well. The international banks need only pull the plug on any remaining life support to the existing market system and allow it to fully implode, all while blaming Trump and his conservative supporters<U+2026><U+201D>\nHe will be the perfect scapegoat for something the alternative media have known is coming for a long, long time.\nNow Smith is spelling it out :\nThe bottom line is, Trump is on the way to the White House because the elites WANT HIM THERE. Now, many liberty proponents, currently in a state of elation, will either ignore or dismiss the primary reason why I was able to predict the Brexit and a Trump win. These will probably be some of the same people that were arguing with me only weeks ago that the elites would NEVER allow Trump in office.\nSo, to clarify: \nTrump may or may not be aware that he and his conservative followers have been positioned into a a trap. We will have to wait and see how he behaves in office (and he WILL be in office, despite the claims of some that the elites will try to <U+201C>stop him<U+201D> before January). My primary point is THAT IT DOES NOT MATTER, at least not at this stage. The elites will initiate a final collapse of the global economy under Trump<U+2019>s watch (this will probably escalate over the course of the next six months), and they WILL blame him and conservatives in general. This IS going to happen. The elites play the long game, and so must we.\nAnd there you have it.\nIt<U+2019>s not much of a secret that the economy is being artificially propped up. The Fed<U+2019>s QE stimulus programs are no longer working. We know it can<U+2019>t remain this way forever.\nAnd even though everyone just feels so much relief that we<U+2019>ve all been spared the nightmare of Hillary Clinton climbing into yet another seat of even more power, we can<U+2019>t just assume we<U+2019>re all going to skip off into happy magical fairy sprinkle land unscathed.\nSure, the people have spoken, but it<U+2019>s only the illusion of power that we<U+2019>re seeing play out now. The Powers That Shouldn<U+2019>t Be running this insanity circus always have a plan<U+2026> how else have they gotten away with controlling the globe for at least the past century?\nAfter saying <U+201C>I told ya so,<U+201D> Smith issued a final warning that we shouldn<U+2019>t be so naive:\nWhile millions of Americans are celebrating Trump<U+2019>s win today, I will remain even more vigilant. The party is just getting started, folks.

Be Sociable, Share! \nAlmost half of all respondents in a recent Russian opinion poll said they feared that the aggravation of relations between Russia and the West caused by the ongoing crisis in Syria could develop into a global military conflict. \nThe share of those who see the probability of World War Three in the near future as high or very high is now at 48 percent and those who appraise it as low or very low comprise 42 percent of society, the privately-owned public opinion research center Levada reported on Monday. The remaining 10 percent of respondents said they couldn<U+2019>t give a simple answer to the question. \nWhen researchers asked citizens if they considered it possible that Russia and the West would eventually find a mutually acceptable solution to the crisis, 35 percent answered that this scenario was likely or very likely. Thirty-nine percent evaluate the probability of such an outcome as low or very low and 26 percent said that they couldn<U+2019>t answer the question. \nJust over half <U+2013> 52 percent <U+2013> of Russians said they approve of their country<U+2019>s involvement in the Syrian conflict and 26 percent said they had a negative or sharply negative attitude to this. Just under a quarter <U+2013> 23 percent <U+2013> couldn<U+2019>t answer the question about their personal view on the subject. Those who thought that Russia should continue the operation and those who thought that airstrikes should be stopped were divided 49 percent against 28 percent respectively, with 24 percent finding the question too difficult to answer. \nThe level of awareness about the situation in Syria and the Russian Air Force operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists there remained fairly high. Eighteen percent said they were very closely following developments in Syria and 64 percent revealed partial familiarity with the issue. Just under a fifth <U+2013> 17 percent <U+2013> said that they were not interested in news about Syria. \nA similar poll conducted a year ago by the independent Levada Center showed that over 70 percent of Russian citizens supported the air operations against IS terrorists in Syria, and almost a half of them agreed that it was right for Russia to support the government of Syria<U+2019>s democratically-elected President Bashar Assad. \nA different poll conducted earlier this month by the state-run research center VTSIOM showed that 73 percent of Russians believed that Western criticism of the air force<U+2019>s counter-terrorism operation in Aleppo, Syria, was ungrounded and prejudiced. Only 6 percent said the allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the Russian military have some basis in reality. \nRussia first deployed an air force contingent in Syria in 2015, after receiving a request for military help from the Syrian government, which is currently battling Islamic State and affiliated groups. Russian war planes began launching airstrikes on terrorists in Syria on September 30, 2015. Their work has aided the Syrian military in achieving considerable success in driving jihadist forces out of the country. \nThis article originally appeared on RT.com Be Sociable, Share!",

But she did offer some friendly advice to the bank<U+2019>s chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, when he asked what he would need to do to mount his own hypothetical bid. <U+201C>I think you would leave Goldman Sachs and start running a soup kitchen somewhere,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton said. <U+201C>Then you could be a legend in your own time, both when you were there and when you left.<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign declined to release transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street firms during the Democratic primary contests, when her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, intensely criticized her for accepting roughly $225,000 per speech. But on Saturday, transcripts of three appearances at Goldman Sachs events were released by WikiLeaks , part of a trove of thousands of emails obtained by hackers who illegally breached the email account of one of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s top aides. The genial relationship she appeared to have with Mr. Blankfein and other Wall Street executives at the events would not have served Mrs. Clinton well in the Democratic primary contests, when Mr. Sanders used the speeches to portray her as being too close to Wall Street. But for Mrs. Clinton, who is often criticized as overly scripted, her relaxed, off-the-cuff exchanges at these private events also revealed a side that she has struggled to show voters under the intense glare of a presidential race. While the emails released last week showed Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s cadre of campaign aides agonizing over jokes she should tell in public and calculating political implications, the transcripts revealed Mrs. Clinton freely dispensing her own quick wit before a closed-door audience. In one question-and-answer session with Mr. Blankfein, Mrs. Clinton relayed an argument she had had as secretary of state, when she tried to persuade a Chinese diplomat that his country had no more right to claim the South China Sea than the United States had to the Pacific Ocean. <U+201C>He says to me, <U+2018>We<U+2019>ll, you know, we<U+2019>ll claim Hawaii,<U+2019><U+201D> Mrs. Clinton told Mr. Blankfein. <U+201C>And I said: <U+2018>Yeah, but we have proof we bought it. Do you have proof you bought any of these places you<U+2019>re claiming?<U+2019><U+201D> Mr. Blankfein interjected: <U+201C>But they have to take New Jersey.<U+201D> <U+201C>No, no, no,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton said. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re going to give them a red state.<U+201D> At these events, which took place in June and October of 2013, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly demurred when asked about her future plans, but it was also clear she was contemplating the political landscape if she were to run again. Mrs. Clinton said that if she mounted a presidential campaign, she would need to begin raising money in 2014 or <U+201C>early the following year.<U+201D> And she expressed concerns about how the news media covered campaigns. <U+201C>Our political press has just been captured by trivia,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton said at a C.E.O. conference in South Carolina at which Mr. Blankfein moderated a discussion. <U+201C>And so you don<U+2019>t want to give them any more time to trivialize the importance of the issues than you have to give them. You want to be able to wait as long as possible.<U+201D> Excerpts from some of her speeches had previously been released by WikiLeaks, shortly after a recording surfaced in which her opponent, Donald J. Trump, made crude remarks about women. The Clinton campaign has refused to verify the authenticity of the transcripts, which came from the hacked email account of John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign chairman. The campaign has blamed the Russian government for the hack and WikiLeaks <U+2014> whose founder, Julian Assange, is a critic of Mrs. Clinton <U+2014> for releasing the emails in a coordinated effort to help Mr. Trump, a view echoed by the Obama administration. The emails released Saturday included a fuller version of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s previously leaked answer to a question posed by Timothy J. O<U+2019>Neill, a senior Goldman executive, at a symposium hosted by the firm. Asked how Wall Street banks should approach efforts by Washington to impose tougher regulation and oversight, Mrs. Clinton made a show of empathy and spoke gently. She detailed her time working with Wall Street as a senator from New York and confided that the <U+201C>conventional wisdom<U+201D> of blaming Wall Street banks for the financial crisis was an <U+201C>oversimplification.<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton described how banks were holding back on lending because they were <U+201C>scared of regulations.<U+201D> She urged banks to allow greater transparency and help policy makers come up with solutions. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re all in this together,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton told the audience. Most strikingly, Mrs. Clinton did not defend the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight legislation, a major achievement of President Obama and congressional Democrats in the wake of the crisis <U+2014> and a target of Wall Street lobbying ever since. Instead, Mrs. Clinton suggested that it had been passed for <U+201C>political reasons<U+201D> by lawmakers panicked by their angry constituents. <U+201C>I think the jury is still out on that because it was very difficult to sort of sort through it all,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton said of the overhaul. Mrs. Clinton took a far stronger line in public, particularly after she began her second bid for president. In a January 2016 speech in New York, amid her tough primary campaign with Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton vowed to defend the Dodd-Frank Act and expand financial regulation to new territory, such as hedge funds and high-frequency traders. But most of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s insights involved foreign policy and her experiences as the nation<U+2019>s top diplomat, including concerns about North Korea<U+2019>s nuclear arsenal, the rise of anti-Japanese sentiment in China and a strikingly prescient prediction about the spread of nationalism in Europe. Mrs. Clinton presented the Pentagon<U+2019>s argument against establishing a no-fly zone in Syria, a policy that she has advocated in her 2016 campaign. Noting that American pilots would have to enforce the no-fly zone, she said, <U+201C>We<U+2019>re not putting our pilots at risk,<U+201D> and added, <U+201C>You<U+2019>re going to kill a lot of Syrians.<U+201D> Other hacked emails suggest Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign had deep concerns about the Wall Street transcripts being made public. In November 2015, as Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign was refusing to release transcripts of her paid speeches, her speechwriter, Dan Schwerin, suggested anonymously leaking to a reporter excerpts from one particular speech he wrote for her: A 2014 address to Deutsche Bank. In that speech, he said in the email, <U+201C>I wrote her a long riff about economic fairness and how the financial industry has lost its way, precisely for the purpose of having something we could show people if ever asked what she was saying behind closed doors for two years to all those fat cats.<U+201D> He also acknowledged that it was <U+201C>definitely not as tough or pointed as we would write it now.<U+201D> Another adviser, Mandy Grunwald, disagreed with Mr. Schwerin about releasing the 2014 speech. Referring to Mrs. Clinton by her initials, Ms. Grunwald argued that the speech had not been hard enough on Wall Street. The remarks, Ms. Grunwald said, <U+201C>make it sound like HRC DOESN<U+2019>T think the game is rigged <U+2014> only that she recognizes that the public thinks so.<U+201D> Ms. Grunwald added: <U+201C>They are angry. She isn<U+2019>t.<U+201D> Mark Landler contributed reporting.

One immediate problem is ObamaCare<U+2019>s expansion of Medicaid, which has seen enrollment at least twice as high as advertised. Most of the insurance coverage gains from the law come from opening Medicaid eligibility beyond its original goal of helping the poor and disabled to include prime-age, able-bodied, childless adults. The Supreme Court made this expansion optional in 2012, and Governors claimed not joining would leave <U+201C>free money<U+201D> on the table because the feds would pick up 100% of the costs of new beneficiaries. In a new report this week for the Foundation for Government Accountability, Jonathan Ingram and Nicholas Horton tracked down the original enrollment projections by actuaries in 24 states that expanded and have since disclosed at least a year of data on the results. Some 11.5 million people now belong to ObamaCare<U+2019>s new class of able-bodied enrollees, or 110% higher than the projections. Analysts in California expected only 910,000 people to sign up, but instead 3.84 million have, 322% off the projections. The situation is nearly as dire in New York, where enrollment is 276% higher than expected, and Illinois, which is up 90%. This liberal state triumvirate is particularly notable because they already ran generous welfare states long before ObamaCare. The data are also an embarrassment to Kentucky (134% over) and Ohio (60% over) because the legislatures in those states rejected expanding. They were unilaterally overruled by Democratic Governor Steve Beshear and Republican John Kasich. Arkansas<U+2019>s compromise Medicaid expansion was hailed as a <U+201C>private option,<U+201D> but 51% more people have signed up for this public option than voters were told at the time. The Foundation for Government Accountability numbers exclude states that expanded recently like Alaska and Louisiana, where it is too soon to draw conclusions. The study also omits Delaware, Massachusetts and Vermont, which obtained Medicaid expansion waivers prior to ObamaCare. New or enlarged entitlements always overwhelm projections, because of so-called <U+201C>woodwork effects<U+201D> where added benefits draw out people the budget gnomes weren<U+2019>t expecting. But there<U+2019>s enough experience now where these effects should have been built into the models. Governors ignored all this to make expanding seem less costly than it would be when the bill came due. The state spending share of new Medicaid enrollment will rise to 5% next year and then to 10% by 2020, up from 0% today. The enrollment overruns mean these states will have less to spend than they planned for every other priority, especially the least fortunate. The Governors who didn<U+2019>t expand and withstood a hail of political and hospital censure are looking prescient.",

It says it also will stop giving future retiree health benefits to staff currently younger than age 50, saving an additional $50 million. \nThe Wilmington, Del.-based pesticides and materials maker, which employs about 50,000 after spinning off such companies as Axalta and Chemours in recent years and laying off 5,000 management, research, and other staff last winter, says it has followed Lockheed, Johnson Controls and other large manufacturers in switching workers from guaranteed pensions to 401(k) savings plans, whose value rises and falls with the investment markets. \nIn 2007, DuPont stopped adding new hires to the pension plan. It continued to boost promised benefits to plan members still working at the company. \nSince then, it has assigned new workers to 401(k) retirement plans. Instead of guaranteeing pensions whose value rises with years of service, the company pays the equivalent of up to 9 percent of employees<U+2019> salaries into investment accounts if they set aside up to 6 percent of their pay. \nWorkers put that money into funds from a menu of investments, in hopes they can stretch the tax-protected accounts, plus Social Security, to pay their way in retirement. \nThe freeze will take place in 2018 if the company stays on schedule to complete its planned merger with Dow Chemical Co. and split into separate pesticide, materials and specialized-products manufacturing companies, according to spokesman Daniel Turner. \nTurner said the freeze was not connected to the Dow deal. Under CEO Edward Breen, DuPont has been cutting jobs, closing plants and consolidating vendors in an effort to boost profits and streamline operations in advance of the reorganization. \n<U+201C>Sadly, the ongoing cash buyout of 18,000 vested pensioners and today<U+2019>s action to end pension accruals and health benefits project a company with little concern for those who have stayed with the company in order to build security for their families in the future,<U+201D> Lawrence Craig Skaggs, a retired DuPont lobbyist, told the Philadelphia Inquirer. \nSince the Dow merger was announced in 2015, Skaggs has posted details and questions concerning DuPont retirement issues at his 6,300-member DuPont Pensioners Facebook site. \n<U+201C>We remain concerned that the DuPont pension plan,<U+201D> which covers 133,000 current workers and retirees, <U+201C>is less than 70 percent funded,<U+201D> Skaggs added, citing Labor Department reports. \nRetirees have been pressing DuPont and Dow to put more assets into retirement plans before they divide the companies, to ensure the plans remain solvent. \nPensioners in corporate plans that run out of cash typically are rescued by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which imposes limits on early retirement and payments above insured levels. \nEarlier this year, DuPont offered some retirees who are not yet collecting pensions the options of taking their money in lump-sum payments, or replacing their pensions with insurance annuities, backed against loss by state insurance guaranty funds.

Everybody<U+2019>s going to be taken care of much better than they<U+2019>re taken care of now. \nIn 1999, Trump was perfectly clear , as reported by Newsmax: \n<U+201C>I said I<U+2019>m conservative, generally speaking, I<U+2019>m conservative, and even very conservative,<U+201D> Trump told King in response to a question about a <U+201C>patients' bill of rights,<U+201D> reports BuzzFeed. \n<U+201C>But I<U+2019>m quite liberal and getting much more liberal on healthcare and other things.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2016 \nDid Trump say it was a <U+201C>disaster from the beginning,<U+201D> or <U+201C>on one level, I think something had to be done<U+201D>? \nPerhaps, we turn to another tweet he had, drawing on the popular hashtag #ObamaCareInThreeWords: REPEAL AND REPLACE!!! #ObamaCareInThreeWords <U+2014> Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2016 \nIt turns out that Donald Trump is a fan of <U+201C>repeal and replace,<U+201D> but his political track record before he ran for president as a Republican shows that what he means by that is <U+201C>single-payer<U+201D><U+2014>the goal of the Obamacare architect all along. \nWhen it comes to Trump's solution for Obamacare<U+2014>making it more competitive for insurance companies<U+2014>this runs antithetical to the goal of single-payer, which is the government (i.e. taxpayers) paying for everyone. \nOne can draw their own conclusions about what Trump actually means right now, because no one can be one hundred percent sure. Yet for a man who styled himself as an outsider and not at all like a <U+201C>politician,<U+201D> his statements on Obamacare show himself very much to be similar to one.",

Western nations, in particular the United States and Britain, are prime suspects. However, there are plenty of unwitting commentators in the emerging world who are playing into the West<U+2019>s hands. Each year, as the BRICS summit draws near, the cacophony from these haters grows louder. Questions about the viability and relevance of the BRICS are raised in the media. \nDuring the build-up to the Goa summit this year, the refrain was similar but with the background buzz that the India-China rift over Pakistan-backed terrorism would derail the summit. However, the predicted outcome of an implosion didn<U+2019>t materialise and, on the contrary, with India and Russia inking the S-400 missile deal , Goa 2016 turned out to be a memorable event. \nSince many innocent readers may have been misinformed by the compromised commentators <U+2013> who will certainly be back like a bounced cheque next year <U+2013> here<U+2019>s a ready reckoner on the BRICS group. So the next time you hear remarks that the BRICS are collapsing, don<U+2019>t lose sleep over the issue. \nWorld needs BRICS \nMost of the global multilateral institutions that exist today are no longer relevant. The IMF and the World Bank, for instance, were founded during the closing years of World War II. In geopolitical time, that<U+2019>s ancient history. Similarly, the G-7 appears to be on life support and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) is no longer a leading organisation. \nWith the western economies perched on monetary and budgetary cliffs, the five BRICS members provide a stable alternate force that offsets the West<U+2019>s decline. Both China and India continue to experience high economic growth and are on course to become mega economies that will completely dwarf the West in the coming decades. Beijing<U+2019>s growth may have fallen under 7 per cent but that<U+2019>s enough to add the equivalent of Holland<U+2019>s national income to the Chinese GDP. \nBottom line: without the BRICS, the world economy will experience 1929 all over again. \nBRICS slowdown, not a meltdown \nUday Kotak, executive vice-president of Kotak Mahindra Bank, feels India should quit the BRICS coalition because of the slowdown in four of the five economies. His view has been echoed by several so-called experts. But curiously, have you ever heard any economist or banker say the OECD must disband because it has basket cases such as Greece or terror exporters such as Turkey? \nAccording to the US-based Centre on Global Interests , <U+201C>You can look at the BRICS from the financial market's point of view, or from a geopolitical point of view. But whichever lens you view it through, what you see is the same: despite economic slowdowns and even economic hardship in some nations, these are far and away the most powerful countries outside of the developed core. Their economies have scale. Their decisions can move financial markets. They have intellectual capital and clout within their regions. And in terms of foreign policy, they are the counterweight to a unipolar world run largely by Washington and its friends in London and Brussels.<U+201D> \nIt adds: <U+201C>In both of these regards <U+2013> economics and foreign policy <U+2013> the BRICS are alive and kicking. In fact, they are more relevant today than they were in November 2001, when Jim O'Neill grouped them into the strange bedfellows that they have become.<U+201D> \nBilaterals can<U+2019>t bring down the BRICS \nIf the UN fails to discuss relevant political issues, the international body is considered a failure. But BRICS is not a platform that was created for discussing politics. The primary role of the five-member group is to remove the West<U+2019>s grip from the levers that control the world economy. By establishing their own New Development Bank, the BRICS have ensured that the IMF is no longer the world<U+2019>s lender-of-last-resort. \nIn this backdrop, fears that bilateral issues involving India and China will wreck summits have consistently proved to be baseless. \nTake Goa 2016. While the Goa Declaration mentions terror, the focus of the summit was not terrorism at all. Sure, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a shot at Pakistan, describing it as the <U+201C>mothership of terrorism<U+201D>, and China defended its ally by saying it had made <U+201C>great sacrifices<U+201D>. But both New Delhi and Beijing were merely playing to their respective galleries even as the real summitry was happening behind closed doors. \nTo be sure, politics can be tabled if it<U+2019>s a side dish <U+2013> like Syria was a couple of years ago <U+2013> but issues with the potential to derail the summit simply have no place in BRICS. \nCritics of the BRICS often point to the India-China border issue as evidence of serious problems. But this misses the point. There always will be different opinions and views among the BRICS countries <U+2013> just like there are differences among NATO or European Union members. \nBRICS are not united but it doesn<U+2019>t matter \nUnlike NATO or the European Union, where the member countries have more or less the same goals and are also of the same racial stock, each of the BRICS countries is different. However, their membership of BRICS gives them a common goal <U+2013> development. As emerging countries, they are focussed on raising their standards of living. \nThe fact that they are united as a group, despite such stark differences in national goals, opinions and geopolitical rivalries and even outright hostilities, points to the viability of the BRICS.",

I have written two different posts covering the subject from different angles, and this will be the third, covering Hillary<U+2019>s response. Each post include at least some, if not all of the undercover recordings released so far by James O<U+2019>Keefe . \nFor over a year, O<U+2019>Keefe risked his life by going deep undercover into the Democrat Party<U+2019>s factory of corruption, and just this week after everyone laughed at Trump for calling the election rigged, O<U+2019>Keefe began releasing portions of the SHOCKING video he took while undercover. In the videos, some of the highest ranking members of the DNC make some of the most jaw-dropping admissions of guilt you<U+2019>ve EVER heard in your lives, not the least of which is, <U+201C>[w]e have a call with Hillary<U+2019>s campaign EVERY DAY to go over what areas need more focus.<U+201D> \nIn the first post I wrote titled, George Soros<U+2019> Master Blueprint to Conquer the West Gets Caught on Camera , I go into detail about how the money funding all the illegal operations caught on film comes from Hillary Clinton <U+2018>s largest donor, none other than George Soros . One very high ranking Democratic operative explains what happens with the money once it comes in. Upon receipt: \n<U+201C>[t]he campaign (Hillary Clinton campaign) pays the DNC, the DNC pays Democracy partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval group, and the Foval Group goes and executes the sh** on the ground.<U+201D> \nWOW! Then, when questioned about the legality, the response was: \n<U+201C>It doesn<U+2019>t matter what the friggin<U+2019> legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherf**ker.<U+201D> \nThat<U+2019>s just the beginning. The evidence gets infinitely worse. Then, in the second post I wrote titled, This Video Guarantees a Trump Win Even With Hillary<U+2019>s Fraud Machine , I present an honest look at both candidates, and how they operate. The post contains 100% of the released undercover footage so far, so you learn EXACTLY who is prescribing what to whom, and I assure you that nothing can prepare you for what James managed to catch on film. You<U+2019>ll be sick. \nThen, I contrast the criminal enterprise Hillary is running with a montage of videos taken over a 30 year span of Donald Trump , and in each of the clips spanning all those years, Trump is asked about potentially running for the Presidency some day. Some of the answers are 30 years old, and all are spontaneous. Unlike the scripted (and now we know, totally false) statements we consistently get from Hillary, it is painfully obvious the answers Trump gives are genuine, and from the heart. \nLove him or hate him, good luck arguing that Trump isn<U+2019>t authentic in the video. You get a good look at who would be in the Oval Office, and it<U+2019>s not the caricature that Team Hillary has tried so hard to create. On the other hand, Team Hillary<U+2019>s behavior is utterly indefensible, and she knows it, which is why she runs like hell in the video below the second reporters begin to ask her about the recordings. \nThere<U+2019>s nowhere to run now though Hillary<U+2026> You and your staff have a lot to answer for<U+2026> much of which is criminal in nature (go figure!) \nArticle posted with permission from The Last Great Stand \nMichael DePinto is a member of the fast growing un-silent American majority that is sick of the insanity going on in this country right now.

Epstein \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-steps-up-claims-of-a-rigged-election-1476663365 \n text: GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump on Sunday intensified his charge that the election is rigged against him by media bias and malfeasance at the ballot box, after his running mate, Mike Pence, tried to temper the nominee<U+2019>s rhetoric by saying the Republicans would accept the Nov. 8 election result. The mixed messages on the Republican ticket came as the presidential race turns toward this week<U+2019>s final debate and as both campaigns were pressing the message that controversies dogging their candidacies are being pushed by outside, opposing forces. Democrat Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s running mate, Tim Kaine, Sunday charged that the Russian government is trying to sway the election to Mr. Trump through hacks of campaign emails. The intensifying focus on the election process comes as Mrs. Clinton enjoys a lead in polls that has grown in the week-plus since a video surfaced of Mr. Trump boasting in 2005 about groping women without their consent. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found Mrs. Clinton has an 11-point lead over her rival, 48% to 37%, a big jump from a 6-point edge she held in mid-September. Most other media polls show Mrs. Clinton with a smaller advantage. Mr. Trump for weeks has been preemptively exhorting supporters to monitor poll locations on Election Day, calls that have divided his GOP supporters. Asked about that on TV Sunday, Mr. Pence said those comments were an attack on the press. Capital Journal is WSJ.com<U+2019>s home for Election 2016 news. <U+201C>I think what Donald Trump is talking about is frankly what appears to be the monolithic support of the national media for Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s campaign,<U+201D> Mr. Pence said, adding in the same appearance, <U+201C>We will absolutely accept the result of the election.<U+201D> Later, a tweet from Mr. Trump on Sunday read: <U+201C>The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary<U+2014>but also at many polling places<U+2014>SAD.<U+201D> Messrs. Trump and Pence have diverged at times during the campaign, such as on Russia policy; during the last presidential debate, Mr. Trump said he hadn<U+2019>t spoken to Mr. Pence about Russia and Syria and disagreed with him. Mr. Pence, who a person close to him said considered dropping from the ticket before last Sunday<U+2019>s second presidental debate, also denounced Mr. Trump after the 2005 video emerged. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, among other Republicans, has distanced himself from Mr. Trump<U+2019>s calls that a corrupt system could cost him the election. But two of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s most prominent supporters<U+2014>former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani <U+2014>have defended Mr. Trump<U+2019>s remarks. Mr. Giuliani, speaking on CNN on Sunday, said <U+201C>there are a few places<U+201D> such as Philadelphia and Chicago where illegal voting has occurred over the years. Other Republicans speaking Sunday argued that a media conspiracy is at play, saying WikiLeaks information that bruises Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s image is largely being ignored amid the growing number of women accusing Mr. Trump of sexual misconduct. Mr. Trump has denied the allegations. Mr. Pence Sunday on NBC painted Clinton campaign emails released by WikiLeaks in recent days as a sign that big donors got access to the former senator and secretary of state. The Clinton campaign has neither confirmed nor denied that the material being posted by WikiLeaks is authentic. But her supporters have focused much of their ire on the leaks themselves. On Sunday, Mr. Kaine described the leaks as an effort to destabilize the election. <U+201C>Hillary and I stand up for the integrity of our elections. Hillary and I stand against Russian efforts to meddle in the American election,<U+201D> the Virginia senator said on ABC. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has said it suspects Russian intelligence agencies are behind the recent hacking of Clinton campaign emails. The FBI has been probing computer breaches directed at various political and election entities in the run up to the November election. Mr. Pence on Sunday also said there was mounting evidence that Moscow was behind the illegally leaked emails. <U+201C>I think there is more and more evidence that implicates Russia and there should be serious consequences,<U+201D> Mr. Pence said on NBC. Russian officials have rejected claims they were involved in the hacks. Mr. Kaine on Fox News also defended Mrs. Clinton in the face of some details of the leak, including over comments between two high-level campaign officials that have rankled Catholic and evangelical groups. Those emails described those faiths as behind the times on gender relations. Mr. Kaine said the emails, if accurate, don<U+2019>t reflect Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s point of view. <U+201C>I do know what Hillary Clinton thinks of Catholicism because she picked a Catholic running mate,<U+201D> he said. Mr. Kaine also took aim at Mr. Trump, who he said is blaming the media, the GOP and the women bringing accusations against him because he knows he is losing. Mr. Kaine called on GOP leaders to back the integrity of the election process. <U+201C>Donald Trump has kind of started to go wilder and wilder,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>He shouldn<U+2019>t be engaging in those scare tactics.<U+201D> Mr. Pence on Fox News lashed out at the media for its coverage of women who claim Mr. Trump sexually assaulted them and said the timing of the allegations in the final weeks before the election raises questions about motivation. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) on Sunday was asked on CNN if there was a double standard in coverage of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s alleged sexual misconduct and the longtime allegations of sexual harassment against Bill Clinton, which the former president has denied. <U+201C>Well it is a double standard, but Bill Clinton is not on the ballot,<U+201D> Ms. Pelosi said, an oft-repeated point made by Democrats since the issue emerged this week. <U+201C>He is not on the ballot, he is not on the ballot. Hillary Clinton is the candidate for president that we are asking people to vote for.<U+201D> <U+2014>Gordon Lubold contributed to this article.

The flu vaccine has a long history of not protecting the vast majority who receives if from becoming ill with the flu. Nor does it change mortality rates. Nor does it change hospitalization rates. \nThe flu vaccine is ineffective for the elderly<U+2014>the most susceptible group recommended to receive annual injections. Although the Powers-That-Be will say the flu vaccine is approximately 50% effective, the real data provides a different picture. (I have written about this many times in my newsletter and in blog posts. Go here to read one post: http://blog.drbrownstein.com/the-truth-about-the-flu-vaccine/ ). \nThe Cochrane Collaboration, an independent group who does not take Big Pharma Cartel money has reported that the flu vaccine does not protect adults against influenza nor does it affect the number of people hospitalized for the flu. Furthermore, Cochrane scientists have reported that the flu vaccine does not prevent people from missing work due to influenza illness. (1) \nThere is not one randomized, double-blind controlled study that shows the flu vaccine is effective at preventing the flu. Not one. In fact, there are studies that show those who get the flu vaccine are more susceptible to other viral agents. \nDo all hospital workers need to be vaccinated with the flu vaccine? There is not a single study showing that this practice is effective. \nI would take this a step further: no one needs a flu vaccine since it fails well over 50% who receives one. \nConventional doctors are proud to say they practice evidence-based medicine. The next time your health care provider tells you to get a flu vaccine, ask them to show you the evidence that the flu vaccine works. If they were truly practicing evidence-based medicine, they would refuse to vaccinate with a product that fails well over 50% who receives it. \n(1) Cochrane Database of Systemic Review, 2010.

Medical Doctors Opposed to Forced Vaccinations <U+2013> Should Their Views be Silenced? eBook <U+2013> Available for immediate download. \nOne of the biggest myths being propagated in the compliant mainstream media today is that doctors are either pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine, and that the anti-vaccine doctors are all <U+201C>quacks.<U+201D> \nHowever, nothing could be further from the truth in the vaccine debate. Doctors are not unified at all on their positions regarding <U+201C>the science<U+201D> of vaccines, nor are they unified in the position of removing informed consent to a medical procedure like vaccines. \nThe two most extreme positions are those doctors who are 100% against vaccines and do not administer them at all, and those doctors that believe that ALL vaccines are safe and effective for ALL people, ALL the time, by force if necessary. \nVery few doctors fall into either of these two extremist positions, and yet it is the extreme pro-vaccine position that is presented by the U.S. Government and mainstream media as being the dominant position of the medical field. \nIn between these two extreme views, however, is where the vast majority of doctors practicing today would probably categorize their position. Many doctors who consider themselves <U+201C>pro-vaccine,<U+201D> for example, do not believe that every single vaccine is appropriate for every single individual. \nMany doctors recommend a <U+201C>delayed<U+201D> vaccine schedule for some patients, and not always the recommended one-size-fits-all CDC childhood schedule. Other doctors choose to recommend vaccines based on the actual science and merit of each vaccine, recommending some, while determining that others are not worth the risk for children, such as the suspect seasonal flu shot. \nThese doctors who do not hold extreme positions would be opposed to government-mandated vaccinations and the removal of all parental exemptions. \nIn this eBook, I am going to summarize the many doctors today who do not take the most extremist pro-vaccine position, which is probably not held by very many doctors at all, in spite of what the pharmaceutical industry, the federal government, and the mainstream media would like the public to believe.

Bulldozers working on the pipeline have already destroyed the graves of the ancestors and relatives the Standing Rock Sioux and other Lakota tribes. Irreplaceable, unique, historic Indian sacred sites have also been destroyed. The pipeline is part of a concerted effort by the US government to gain \"energy independence\" and be in a position to supply oil and gas to Europe as an alternative to Russian gas. It is a literal pipe dream in both respects given that the US cannot wean itself off its massive addiction to and greed for oil and energy and the fact that Europe will be dependent on Russia oil and gas for decades to come. The pipeline not only threatens the environment in the USA including the drinking water supply from the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, but also the American people given that fracking has been implicated in earthquakes .",

Well, the folks doing research over at Zero Hedge have completely outdone themselves with this discovery that will never reach the mainstream. <U+201C>Ironically<U+201D>, that is the same Peter Kadzik who has proven his <U+201C>impartiality<U+201D> in multiple WikiLeaks emails including this newly released bombshell in which Kadzik provides a very helpful <U+201C>heads up<U+201D> about Hillary<U+2019>s email server investigation. This is what Kadzik emailed to John Podesta (via gmail) on May 19, 2015: There is a HJC oversight hearing today where the head of our Civil Division will testify. Likely to get questions on State Department emails. Another filing in the FOIA case went in last night or will go in this am that indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails. Perhaps Mr. Kadzik could explain to our readers <U+2013> and the American public <U+2013> why this particular message was delivered via his private, gmail account rather than his official DOJ email account? Go and r ead the article to learn of Kadzik<U+2019>s background . It<U+2019>s positively incestuous with ties to the Clintons and Podestas. Here<U+2019>s what you can do.

Suppose the company<U+2019>s research was cited thousands of times in the press, as the authoritative standard of proof<U+2014>and anyone who disputed that research was labeled a conspiracy theorist and a quack and a danger to the community and an anti-science lunatic. \nWould you begin to suspect the company had some awesome media connections? Would you suspect some very powerful people were backing the company? \nThis is exactly the situation with the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Read these two quotes: \nThe government<U+2019>s Vaccine for Children Program (a CDC organization) purchases vaccines for about 50 percent of children in the U.S.<U+201D> (The Atlantic, February 10, 2015) \n<U+201C>The CDC currently spends over $4 billion purchasing vaccines [annually] from drug makers<U+2026><U+201D> (Health Impact News, October 24, 2016) \nHowever, the CDC is also the gold standard for research on the safety and efficacy of vaccines. It turns out an unending stream of studies on these subjects. And the results of those studies are dutifully reported in the mainstream press. \nDo you think, under any circumstances, the CDC would publish data showing vaccines are ineffective and dangerous? They<U+2019>d be cutting their own throats. \n<U+201C>Well, we spend $4 billion a year buying vaccines from drug companies, but guess what? These vaccines are often dangerous<U+2026><U+201D> \nEvery time you read about a CDC study on vaccines, keep this obvious conflict of interest in mind. \nWhen, in 2014, William Thompson, a long-time CDC researcher, publicly admitted he and his colleagues had buried data that would have shown the MMR vaccine increases the risk of autism, he was throwing a stick of dynamite into the whole CDC operation. He was also saying, in recorded phone conversations, that the CDC was lying about vaccine safety in other studies. \nThis is why major media refused to cover or investigate Thompson<U+2019>s claims. This is why they spread a blanket of silence over his revelations. \nThompson was threatening a $ 4-billion-a-year enterprise. \nThe CDC is both a PR agency for, and a buyer from, Big Pharma. \n\nSpeaking of PR, would you like to see an example of how the CDC promotes the yearly flu vaccine by lying egregiously about flu deaths in the United States? \nIn December of 2005, the British Medical Journal (online) published a shocking report by Peter Doshi, which created tremors through the halls of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), where <U+201C>the experts<U+201D> used to tell the press that 36,000 people in the US die every year from the flu. \nHere is a quote from Doshi<U+2019>s report, <U+201C>Are US flu death figures more PR than science?<U+201D> (BMJ 2005; 331:1412): \n<U+201C>[According to CDC statistics], <U+2018>influenza and pneumonia<U+2019> took 62,034 lives in 2001<U+2014>61,777 of which were attributable to pneumonia and 257 to flu, and in only 18 cases was the flu virus positively identified.<U+201D> \nBoom. \nYou see, the CDC has created one overall category that combines both flu and pneumonia deaths. Why do they do this? Because they disingenuously assume that the pneumonia deaths are complications stemming from the flu. \nThis is an absurd assumption. Pneumonia has a number of causes. \nBut even worse, in all the flu and pneumonia deaths, only 18 revealed the presence of an influenza virus. \nTherefore, the CDC could not say, with assurance, that more than 18 people died of influenza in 2001. Not 36,000 deaths. 18 deaths. \nDoshi continued his assessment of published CDC flu-death statistics: <U+201C>Between 1979 and 2001, [CDC] data show an average of 1348 [flu] deaths per year (range 257 to 3006).<U+201D> These figures refer to flu separated out from pneumonia. \nThis death toll is obviously far lower than the parroted 36,000 figure. \nHowever, when you add the sensible condition that lab tests have to actually find the flu virus in patients, the numbers of flu deaths plummet even further. \nIn other words, it<U+2019>s all promotion and hype. \n<U+201C>Well, uh, we say that 36,000 people die from the flu every year in the US. But actually, it<U+2019>s closer to 20. However, we can<U+2019>t admit that, because if we did, we<U+2019>d be exposing our gigantic psyop. The whole campaign to scare people into getting a flu shot would have about the same effect as warning people to carry iron umbrellas, in case toasters fall out of upper-story windows<U+2026>and, by the way, we<U+2019>d be put in prison for fraud.<U+201D> \nThe CDC must turn out a steady stream of outrageous lies about the need for vaccines. If they didn<U+2019>t, they<U+2019>d have no way to justify the billions of dollars they spend every year buying the vaccines from drug companies. \nSince the sold-out major media won<U+2019>t connect these dots, I and others need to. \nJon Rappoport \nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED , EXIT FROM THE MATRIX , and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX , Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29 th District of California.

        "input": "time: null \n author: SARAH HARRISON \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/17/opinion/why-the-world-needs-wikileaks.html?_r=0 \n text: Berlin <U+2014> My organization, WikiLeaks, took a lot of heat during the run-up to the recent presidential election. We have been accused of abetting the candidacy of Donald J. Trump by publishing cryptographically authenticated information about Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s campaign and its influence over the Democratic National Committee, the implication being that a news organization should have withheld accurate, newsworthy information from the public. The Obama Justice Department continues to pursue its six-year criminal investigation of WikiLeaks, the largest known of its kind, into the publishing of classified documents and articles about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay and Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s first year as secretary of state. According to the trial testimony of one F.B.I. agent, the investigation includes several of WikiLeaks founders, owners and managers. And last month our editor, Julian Assange, who has asylum at Ecuador<U+2019>s London embassy, had his internet connection severed. I can understand the frustration, however misplaced, from Clinton supporters. But the WikiLeaks staff is committed to the mandate set by Mr. Assange, and we are not going to go away, no matter how much he is abused. That<U+2019>s something that Democrats, along with everyone who believes in the accountability of governments, should be happy about. Despite the mounting legal and political pressure coming from Washington, we continue to publish valuable material, and submissions keep pouring in. There is a desperate need for our work: The world is connected by largely unaccountable networks of power that span industries and countries, political parties, corporations and institutions; WikiLeaks shines a light on these by revealing not just individual incidents, but information about entire structures of power. While a single document might give a picture of a particular event, the best way to shed light on a whole system is to fully uncover the mechanisms around it <U+2014> the hierarchy, ideology, habits and economic forces that sustain it. It is the trends and details visible in the large archives we are committed to publishing that reveal the details that tell us about the nature of these structures. It is the constellations, not stars alone, that allow us to read the night sky. There are two contradictory myths about how we operate: on one hand, that we simply dump whatever comes to us into the public<U+2019>s arms; and on the other, that we pick and choose material to harm our alleged political enemies. We do neither. Yes, we believe in the integrity of source material, in the value of conserving pristine collections of documents, and we strive to make this historical record accessible to the public. We publish in full, in an uncensored and uncensorable fashion. But we also research, validate and contextualize the submissions we receive. While it can be difficult to balance the needs of the public to have timely access to large archives with individual privacy, such concerns have mostly been disingenuous. At times we receive individual documents, but we have come to specialize in large collections. Over the last decade we have vetted, indexed and published an average of 3,000 documents per day, including over 300,000 reports covering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, more than two million emails from Syrian political figures and over 120,000 documents from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We also curate the Public Library of United States Diplomacy , the world<U+2019>s largest collection of diplomatic cables (nearly three million). WikiLeaks has transformed more than 10 million documents into a unique searchable archive, not only making our website the world<U+2019>s largest online library for suppressed information, but also enabling greater contextualization through relationships across publications. Some have accused us of being pawns of the Russian government, but this misrepresents our principles and basic operations. WikiLeaks relies on our editor<U+2019>s invention of a secure anonymous online submission system to protect sources<U+2019> identities. This technology has become a standard for many media outlets around the world. We prefer not to know who our sources are; we do not want to, and usually do not need to. What matters to us is the authenticity of the documents. This has always been our position and approach, whether we were publishing material about the George W. Bush administration<U+2019>s wars or corruption within the Democratic Party. The establishment media was happy to work with us on the former, but turned against us when it came to the latter, calling into question our intentions and those of Mr. Assange. CNN has even suggested, wrongly, that readers may have legal troubles if they download documents from our site. While we have no institutional bias and can publish only what we receive, we are happy to publish documents about any presidential candidate, at any time, anywhere for a globally significant election. We publish without fear or favor, bringing transparency to powerful factions and secretive institutions, not taking any sides except that of the truth. We believe in the democratization of information and the power that knowledge gives to people to further peace, accountability and self-determination. WikiLeaks will continue publishing, enforcing transparency where secrecy is the norm. While threats against our editor are mounting, Mr. Assange is not alone, and his ideas continue to inspire us and people around the world. Sarah Harrison is a journalist and editor for WikiLeaks.

Hillary Clinton, an agent for the oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump. This shows that both the political establishment of both political parties and the media no longer have credibility with the American people.It remains to be seen whether Trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore American jobs and to establish friendly and respectful relations with Russia, China, Syria, and Iran.It also remains to be seen how the oligarchy will respond to Trump's victory. Wall Street and its agent, the Federal Reserve, can cause an economic crisis in order to put Trump on the defensive. Rogue agents in the CIA and Pentagon can cause a false flag attack that would disrupt friendly relations with Russia. Trump could make a mistake and retain neoconservatives in his government.With Trump there is at least hope. Unless Trump is obstructed by bad judgment and obstacles put in his way, we should expect an end to Washington's orchestrated conflict with Russia, the removal of the US missiles on Russia's border with Poland and Romania, the end of the conflict in Ukraine, and the end ofWashington's effort to overthrow the Syrian government. However, achievements such as these implythe total defeat of the oligarchy. Although Trump defeated Hillary, the oligarchy still exists and is stillpowerful.Trump said that he no longer sees the point of NATO 25 years after the Soviet collapse. If he sticks tohis view, it means a big political change in Washington's EU vassals. The hostility toward Russia ofthe current EU and NATO officials would have to cease.We do not know who Trump will select to serve in his government. It is likely that Trump is unfamiliarwith the various possibilities and their positions on issues. It really depends on who is advising Trump and what advice they give him. Once we see his government, we will know whether we can be hopefulfor the changes that now have a chance. If Trump is actually successful in curbing the power and budget of the military/security complex and in holding Wall Street politically accountable, he could be assassinated. \nPravda.Ru Trump<U+2019>s success shocks global markets",

We are asserting our rights with swagger and demanding to be treated with fairness instead of being used as political props, the <U+201C>eyes and ears<U+201D> you can plug in to be a front-line defense against the Islamic State. We<U+2019>re not Mr. Potato Head counterterrorism experts. We are Americans, and alienating us could prove to be politically costly. Rampant Islamophobia has inspired Muslims to get more politically engaged. We<U+2019>re not a huge group of voters; we make up about 1 percent of the population. But many of us live in states such as Michigan, Ohio, Virginia and Florida, where swing voters <U+2014> and voters who might be turned off by a candidate who pledges <U+201C>extreme vetting<U+201D> of Muslims <U+2014> can make a difference. One Muslim advocacy group reports an increase of more than 30 percent in Muslim voter registration since 2012. Two weeks ago, Hillary Clinton began running a powerful ad featuring Khizr Khan , the Pakistani Muslim father of an Army captain killed in Iraq who beat down Donald J. Trump at the Democratic National Convention with his worn-out copy of the Constitution. I spoke to Mr. Khan, the very unlikely star of this election season, shortly after the ad featuring him was released. He is affectionately known as <U+201C>Khizr Uncle<U+201D> to many of us South Asians who are not related to him but still proudly claim kinship due to shared immigrant roots. I asked if he<U+2019>d considered stepping back from the campaign because of the spotlight on his family and the nasty trolling. <U+201C>Those are my words and I have spoken them a million times,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>That criticism is worth it. We will do this a million times over and over again.<U+201D> Mr. Khan, who refers to Mr. Trump as <U+201C>the bogus candidate,<U+201D> says that after his convention speech and being criticized by Mr. Trump, he has received encouragement from people all over the country, who tell his wife and him that they are <U+201C>testaments to the goodness of America.<U+201D> In 2008, it is unlikely that Mr. Khan would have been the star of a campaign ad or a symbol of American goodness. That year, two Muslim women in headscarves were barred from sitting behind the podium by volunteers for the Obama campaign. That shameful act was done to protect Barack Obama from the <U+201C>Muslim<U+201D> rumor he<U+2019>s had to endure for years, one that was fanned enthusiastically by the current Republican presidential nominee. Linda Sarsour , the executive director of the Arab American Association of New York, says for some Muslim voters this year, <U+201C>fear is a motivator,<U+201D> but for others <U+201C>Islamophobia fuels us to demonstrate our political power in the face of the opposition.<U+201D> In a poll, Muslims cited civil rights as the key election issue for them , next to education, the economy and a concern about harassment of Muslim students. Khurru m Wahid , a Florida lawyer who helped found Emerge USA , a nonprofit group that encourages Muslim political engagement, explained the uptick in registration as a response to both outrage at the Republican nominee and Muslims being embraced by the Democrats. Thanks to Mr. Trump, however, Democrats don<U+2019>t need to work too hard to convince Muslim women. By suggesting that Ghazala Khan, Mr. Khan<U+2019>s wife, may not have been <U+201C> allowed <U+201D> to speak at the Democratic convention because of her religion, Mr. Trump unintentionally prompted the creation of the American Muslim Women PAC , the first of its kind. <U+201C>Most Muslim women didn<U+2019>t realize they were being viewed like that,<U+201D> said Shailee Seddiq, communications director for the PAC. <U+201C>They didn<U+2019>t know people thought we weren<U+2019>t allowed to speak.<U+201D> Seeme Gull Khan Hasan, a co-founder of the group Muslims for America , also helped found the group Muslims for Bush in 2003 and raised a significant amount of money for the 2008 McCain-Palin campaign. This year, she<U+2019>s with Mrs. Clinton <U+2014> <U+201C>by default.<U+201D> <U+201C>Muslims are almost like leprosy for Republicans, who do not want to come near us,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>Even if we promise them voters. Because their base does not want them to talk to us.<U+201D> There are Muslims who support Mr. Trump too, loyal to the very candidate who demands loyalty oaths. A Virginia businessman, Sajid Tarar, started something he called American Muslims for Trump and gave the closing prayer at the Republican convention. He was booed. Although one poll shows that Mrs. Clinton is likely to get about 70 percent of the Muslim vote, some believe she isn<U+2019>t so much better than Mr. Trump, and would stand in the way of the radical change needed to improve the lives of average Juans and Muhammads. That<U+2019>s why some Muslim voters I talked to are considering third-party candidates. Tauhid Mahmud, a graduate student in New York, said he was planning to vote for the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, as a way of saying: <U+201C>No, I<U+2019>m not going to vote for you just because you<U+2019>re not Trump. You need to earn it. <U+201D> Mr. Wahid understands this impulse. But he wants Muslim voters to understand that lasting change has proved to be evolutionary, not revolutionary. <U+201C>It takes sustained engagement and the building of pressure to move the giant cruise ship known as American policy,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Do not give up so quickly.<U+201D> It is affirming to see that eight years after America elected its first <U+201C>Muslim, socialist, Kenyan<U+201D> president, some people are openly embracing Muslims, rejecting bigotry and inviting us to their dinner tables to taste this strange phenomenon known as meat loaf. However, I<U+2019>m not content with table scraps, pity invitations and opportunistic photo-ops. We<U+2019>re speaking out, voting and throwing down. To echo Khizr Uncle, we<U+2019>ll keep doing it <U+2014> a million times over and over again. Correction: November 4, 2016 An Op-Ed article on Wednesday about voting by Muslims misspelled the surname of the communications director for the American Muslim Women PAC. She is Shailee Seddiq, not Siddique. Wajahat Ali is the creative director of Affinis Labs, a hub for social entrepreneurship and innovation.

Recommended \nA doctor has said that he believes the release of 5 million GM mosquitoes per week in Brazil may be causing a rise in brain cancer among humans. (2 hours ago) \nPhys.org reports: \nThey will mate with the females of the ordinary mosquitoes, spawning babies with a genetically inbuilt flaw that causes them to die quickly. \nWith their work done, the modified father mosquitoes will then give up the ghost themselves<U+2014>as they are genetically programmed to do. \nOxitec says its factory in the town of Piracicaba, northwest of Sao Paulo, can produce 60 million mutant mosquitoes a week. \nPiracicaba is the world<U+2019>s <U+201C>first and biggest factory<U+201D> of genetically modified mosquitos, said Oxitec president Hadyn Parry. Recommended \nU.S. regulators could allow the release of millions of genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes into the state of Florida to fight the Zika virus. (2 hours ago) \n<U+201C>This is the only place where we have a factory like this. We can use this as a hub for Brazil,<U+201D> said Parry, who traveled to Piracicaba for the plant opening. \nCurrently their only Brazilian customer is the city of Piracicaba, <U+201C>but we are having conversations with several municipalities and states,<U+201D> Parry said. \nMosquitoes by the millions \nAccording to the firm, five field tests that they conducted between 2011 and 2014<U+2014>in Panama and the Cayman Islands, as well as the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia<U+2014>showed the population of wild Aedes aegypti insects dropped by 90 percent after the mutant mosquitoes were released. \nOxitec does not yet have a sales permit from Brazil<U+2019>s Anvisa health authorities, and there are no epidemiological studies showing whether mosquito-carried diseases drop after the factory-bred insects are released. Recommended \nBritish company Oxitec hope to win approval to release millions of genetically modified mosquitoes in the Florida Keys, pointing to climate change and the rise of tropical diseases as the need. (2 hours ago) \nParry is not concerned. <U+201C>We are still waiting for Anvisa approval<U+2014>we have no date for it, but we expect it for 2017,<U+201D> he said. \nAnd none of this has stopped the mayor of Piracicaba from signing a four-year, $1.1 million deal with Oxitec. \nIn its first wave, the company will release 10 million factory-bred mosquitos each week into this city of 360,000 people. \nThe need for insect control is pressing, as the summer in the southern hemisphere approaches and the mosquito population<U+2014>and cases of the diseases that they carry<U+2014>is likely to boom. \nAs of July nearly 1.4 million cases of dengue were recorded in Brazil, following the record 1.6 million cases in 2015, according to health ministry figures. Recommended \nThe United States government have announced plans to introduce GM mosquitoes in Florida in an attempt to thwart the spread of the dengue and chikungunya virus. (2 hours ago) \nIn the same period 174,000 cases of Zika were reported. \nThe Zika virus outbreak began in late 2015 in Brazil and has since spread across the Americas. \nZika is particularly dangerous to pregnant women because it can cause birth defects such as microcephaly, in which babies are born with unusually small heads and brain deformities. \nZika infection has also been linked to a nerve and immune disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome.",

The Chilcot Report , a damning 12-volume, 2.6-million-word inquiry into Britain<U+2019>s role in the Iraq War, did not get much attention on either side of the pond upon its July release. The probe was overlooked at a time that the Iraq War was still raging even though everyone thought it was over, and the millennials I talked to had little idea of the lies or the costs. This summer and fall, it became increasingly clear that the tumultuous U.S. election cycle will not propel anyone with a peace platform to the presidency. I decided I needed to do something that will be useful in the face of even more wars after the election madness is over. \nSo we launched a People<U+2019>s Tribunal on the Iraq War as a tool to bring the anti-war movement together and build what is needed for 2017. We aim to lay the lies and costs at the feet of President Barack Obama and call for a commission on Truth and Accountability. There are years<U+2019> worth of testimony in reports, lawsuits, books and articles. We have read the facts about the lies and costs over the years. But the totality has never been been pulled together to show the breadth of all effected. \nAccording to a report released last year by Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), Physicians for Global Survival and International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, the U.S. invasion and occupation killed at least one million Iraqi people. That would be more 10 million people in the United States if we compared it in terms of percentage of the population. Imagine the effect of 10 million people dying. \nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \nThere are over 100,000 casualties on the side of the U.S. and the coalition of the willing, with a small percentage of those dead. The rest are living with permanent physical and psychological wounds, some so bad that U.S. military veterans are committing suicide at a rate of 20 a day. In 2012, suicides surpassed war as a the leading cause of death in the U.S. military. \nSince 2001, U.S. wars have cost taxpayers nearly $5 trillion, according to a new report from Brown University<U+2019>s Watson Institute. But few can understand what that number actually means. Nor does this amount count the cost to people in Iraq or other members of the coalition of the willing. \nI have heard these reports at various tribunals over the years. But numbers and facts don<U+2019>t change hearts and minds. This tribunal will be different. It will be a people<U+2019>s tribunal, to be witnessed by the public, which will be presented with a large body of evidence. \nThe participants on the days of the tribunal will be <U+201C>delivering<U+201D> evidence with a five-minute statement about the meaning of that evidence. Dennis Kucinich will present the letter he wrote to Congress in October of 2002 outlining his research which showed there was no operational connection between the Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda or weapons of mass destruction. Jeremy Corbyn will deliver the Chilcot Report. Elizabeth Holtzman, the member of Congress in the 1970s recognized as the woman who impeached Nixon, will deliver her book calling for the Impeachment of George W. Bush. \nWe will be joined by people from across the United States and world. The World Tribunal on Iraq , which culminated in Istanbul, Turkey and has held sessions across the globe, will deliver all of these testimonies. The Brussels Tribunal will deliver the book and testimony that emerged from their efforts. Inder Comar will deliver the documents that make up the ongoing class action suit against six members of the George W. Bush administration alleging that the Iraq War constituted a war of aggression. There will be over 50 offers of testimony each day. \nOn day one, December first, we will focus on the lies that fed the drive to war. On day two, we will hear more than 50 people testify to innumerable costs of U.S. war in Iraq, which in fact goes back at least 25 years . \nYes, there is a staggering cost to U.S. taxpayers<U+2014>but also the cost to the planet and the militarization of our cities and police departments. We will hear from the mother of a young black man who was killed the last week of high school by a cop who was a veteran of the Iraq War suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. We will hear from soldiers who were raped by fellow soldiers. Rabbis and priests will discuss the cost to our morality. We will hear about the costs of the U.S. use of depleted uranium to Iraqis and the children of American soldiers who served there. The event will be live streamed on The Real News, with testimony delivered in person, by live stream or by video. The combination of all the testimony will be delivered to Obama and Congress. But the real work has already begun. The coalition is using the tribunal to gather local communities to discuss the cost of war to them, encouraging them to review what they could have had instead of war. Such collective exercises demonstrate how the costs of war come home, literally. \nMost of the members of our coalition are outreaching to their lists to join with a call to Obama for a Commission on Truth and Accountability. Other partners are outreaching for voices that still need to join those testifying. When the election is finally over, testifiers will begin to discuss their testimony in the media, laying a path to the tribunal of details, broken hearts, destroyed communities and devastated families. We must tell our truth as passionately and effectively as the architects of war tell their lies. We must come together and gather the stories of destruction and loss, in order to witness and remember. Join in. Make it your own. Share with your community. Raise awareness. The time to stop the next war is now.",

It can cause a very minor flue - two days of a low fever and uncomfortable feeling for a quarter of those infected - that is all. It does not cause, as was claimed by sensationalists in the media and various self-serving \"scientists\", birth defects like microcephaly. \nWe told you so. \nThe piece refereed to a Congressional Research Service report and various sound scientific papers. It concluded: There is absolutely no sane reason for the scary headlines and the panic they cause. \nThe virus is harmless. It is possible, but seems for now very unlikely, that it affects some unborn children. There is absolutely no reason to be concerned about it. \nThe artificial media panic continued and huge amounts of money were poured into dangerous insecticides to kill mosquitoes (and important pollinators) that did not do any harm. Indeed, generous use of some of these insecticides likely were the very cause of a blip in microencephaly cases in northeastern Brazil. \nIn March we wrote: Reading About Zika May Hurt Your Brain . \nWe listed 35 \"news\" headlines about potential catastrophes related to a Zika epidemic.

The pieces were pure speculations though some quoted this or that \"expert\" who was hunting for new research funds or lobbying for some pharmaceutical or pesticide conglomerate. \nIn June we added: Zika Virus Does Not Cause Birth Defects - Fighting It Probably Does . \nNew serious research found what some people in Brazil had suspected from the very start of the small and strictly locally limited jump in microencephaly cases in Brazil: [D]octors in the Zika affected areas in Brazil pointed out that the real cause of somewhat increased microcephaly in the region was probably the insecticide pyriproxyfen, used to kill mosquito larvae in drinking water: The Brazilian doctors noted that the areas of northeast Brazil that had witnessed the greatest number of microcephaly cases match with areas where pyriproxyfen is added to drinking water in an effort to combat Zika-carrying mosquitoes . Pyriproxyfen is reported to cause malformations in mosquito larvae, and has been added to drinking water in the region for the past 18 months. \nPyriproxyfen is produced by a Sumitomo Chemical - an important Japanese poison giant. It was therefore unsurprising that the New York Times and others called the doctors report a \"conspiracy theory\" and trotted out some \"experts\" to debunk it....But [s]cientist at the New England Complex Systems Institute also researched the pyriproxyfen thesis. They found : Pyriproxifen is an analog of juvenile hormone, which corresponds in mammals to regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development causes microcephaly . ...[T]ests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer, Sumitomo, widely quoted as giving no evidence for developmental toxicity, actually found some evidence for such an effect , including low brain mass and arhinencephaly<U+2014>incomplete formation of the anterior cerebral hemispheres<U+2014>in rat pups. Finally, the pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented<U+2014>it has never before been applied to a water supply on such a scale. ...Given this combination of information we strongly recommend that the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended pending further investigation. \nToday the Washington Post finally admits that the Zika virus does not cause birth defects: [T]o the great bewilderment of scientists, the epidemic has not produced the wave of fetal deformities so widely feared when the images of misshapen infants first emerged from Brazil. \nInstead, Zika has left a puzzling and distinctly uneven pattern of damage across the Americas. According to the latest U.N. figures, of the 2,175 babies born in the past year with undersize heads or other congenital neurological damage linked to Zika, more than 75 percent have been clustered in a single region: northeastern Brazil. \nThe localities where the flue virus occurred outside of a small area in Brazil saw no increase in birth defect numbers. The number of (naturally occurring) microcephality cases stayed constant despite a large increase in (harmless) Zika virus infections. The numbers in Brazil also turned out to be partially inflated because of a lack of standard diagnosis criteria and unreliable statistics. A factor we had pointed to in our very first piece. \nThe WaPo piece today muses about several \"possible\" causes for the local increase in cases in northeastern Brazil that indeed happened. It quotes some of the very \"experts\", like from the pharmaceutical industry influenced CDC, that were wrong on the issue since the first panic headline. It strenuously avoids to even mention the most likely cause - the excessive local use of an insecticide that is supposed to cause birth defects - in developing mosquitoes. Thus the reporting is still void of journalistic ethics and irresponsible in its conclusions. \nIt did not take much effort to get this right. An hour or two of skimming through publicly available sources of good standing, some basic higher education and sound reasoning was enough. But instead of doing such basic inquiries \"journalists\" and media \"served\" panic and speculations by biased \"experts\". Keep this story in mind for the next sensationalist onslaught of panic headline. There surely will be some \"interests\" behind those; just don't expect unbiased facts and basic logic reasoning.

The core consumer price index slipped 0.4% from a year earlier in October, adjusted for fresh food and energy prices, according to data released Friday by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. The reading marked the eighth consecutive monthly decline, but was smaller than the 0.5% drop in the previous month. Economists polled by the Nikkei had expected the index to fall 0.4%. Gasoline and kerosene prices fell at slower rates, giving the index some support, according to the ministry. Still, the continued decline in overall prices suggests the Bank of Japan remains far from its goal of generating 2% inflation in the face of weak demand and persistent doubts over prospects for rising prices. The so-called <U+201C>core-core<U+201D> index, which excludes both food and energy prices, rose 0.2% in October after being flat in the previous month. The data overall suggest the Bank of Japan remains far from its goal of generating 2% inflation in the face of weak demand and persistent doubts over prospects for rising prices. The Bank of Japan<U+2019>s own inflation gauge rose 0.3% from a year earlier in October, according to data released Friday by the central bank. The reading of the so-called BOJ core index, which measures consumer prices excluding fresh food and energy, improved from 0.2% September. Officials see the index as a reliable gauge of Japan<U+2019>s underlying price trends. In its Nov. 1 quarterly outlook, the central bank forecast that the core inflation rate will reach 2% by around fiscal 2018, which ends March 2019. Many economists continue to see the BOJ<U+2019>s price views as too optimistic, despite some recent good news, such as the reversal in the yen<U+2019>s strength following Donald Trump <U+2019>s victory in the U.S. presidential election. The core index for the Tokyo metropolitan area for November fell 0.4% from a year earlier, according to the ministry. Economists see Tokyo figures as a leading indicator of nationwide price trends.

In short, he had friends who were going to abort but had the baby who then grew up to be a great kid which touched his heart personally. And in just the past few days I heard him say he basically went along with the abortion idea in his prior years because his daughter thought it was an OK thing, so he thought it was an OK thing, too. If Ivanka is nearing 35, then she probably DID think it was OK when she was 20-ish. (He did not say that in a blaming or scapegoating kind of way, btw.) Granted, Trump is obviously NOT a Biblically-discipled follower of Jesus. He may be a BELIEVER in Jesus, but he has obviously never been discipled. Trump needs an Aquila & Priscilla to <U+201C><U+2026>take him unto them, and expound unto him the way of God more perfectly.<U+201D> (Acts 18:26). \nHere<U+2019>s Trump<U+2019>s anti-abortion statement from two days ago at his FB site.

The baby cannot determine the circumstances. Whatever happened to adoption, for pete<U+2019>s sake?!): \n[<U+2026>] Donald J. Trump February 16 at 4:11pm \nLet me be clear<U+2014>I am pro-life. I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk. I did not always hold this position, but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me. My story is well documented, so I will not retell it here. However, what I will do with the remaining space is express my feelings about life, and the culture of life, as we approach the 43nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade. \nI build things. There is a process involved in building things. We tap into a lot of disciplines with engineering being one of the most important. The rules for putting structures together are as strict as are the rules of physics. These rules have stood the test of time and have become the path to putting together structures that endure and are beautiful. America, when it is at its best, follows a set of rules that have worked since our founding. One of those rules is that we, as Americans, revere life and have done so since our Founders made it the first, and most important, of our <U+201C>unalienable<U+201D> rights. \nOver time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of country. They are missing, and they are missed. \nThe Supreme Court in 1973 based their decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found. Even if we take the court at its word, that abortion is a matter of privacy, we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds, then, should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress. Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best. \nIf using taxpayer money to facilitate our slide to a culture of death was not enough, the 1973 decision became a landmark decision demonstrating the utter contempt the court had for federalism and the 10th Amendment. Roe v. Wade gave the court an excuse to dismantle the decisions of state legislatures and the votes of the people. This is a pattern that the court has repeated over and over again since that decision. Perhaps Roe v. Wade became yet another incidence of disconnect between the people and their government. \nWe are in the middle of a presidential political cycle and votes will be cast in just days. The citizens of this nation will have the chance to vote for candidates that are aligned with their individual worldviews. It is my hope that they will choose the builder, the man who has the ability to imagine the greatness of this nation. The next President must follow those principles that work best and that reinforce the reverence Americans hold for life. A culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness. It is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again. \n120K Likes 12K Comments 23K Shares [<U+2026>]",

A Democratic presidential candidate hasn<U+2019>t won Texas since Jimmy Carter in 1976. John McCain beat Barack Obama by 12 points in 2008, and Mitt Romney won by 16 points four years later. A record-breaking 15.1 million people are now registered to<U+00A0>vote<U+00A0>in Texas, an increase of more than 1.45 million since the 2012 election, according to Secretary of State Carlos Cascos. Texas doesn<U+2019>t register voters by party, so it is unclear which party benefits the most. Mr. Cascos said that aside from population growth, the leading factor in the tide of newly<U+00A0>registered voters appears to be increased interest in the presidential election. <U+201C>The only thing we can glean from this data is that the newly registered voters are disproportionately Hispanic,<U+201D><U+00A0>said Mark Jones, a political-science professor at Rice University. But he said <U+201C>there<U+2019>s also an increase in non-Hispanic voters.<U+201D> Some of the new voters could be people who registered <U+201C>specifically to oppose Trump<U+00A0>or people brought into the political process by Trump and who will support him,<U+201D> Mr. Jones said. Recent polls show Mr. Trump<U+2019>s lead here has narrowed, prompting Real Clear<U+00A0>Politics, which averages polling, to move Texas into the tossup column. Political experts still expect the Republican nominee take the state, but say discontent with him among Texas conservatives, combined with a continuing push from Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s Democratic backers to tap Hispanic voters, could make the margin slimmer than usual for the GOP. In Harris County, which includes Houston, the number of registered voters with Spanish surnames increased 22% between July 2012 and July 2016, numbers compiled by the county clerk show. Those with non-Spanish surnames grew only 10% over the same period. Similar figures were reported in Dallas County. A Wall Street Journal analysis found Texas counties with significant voter increases don<U+2019>t appear to be fertile ground for Mr. Trump, because of their large populations of Hispanics and college-educated voters,<U+00A0>two challenging demographic groups for him. <U+201C>In the past, we had to explain to people why it was important to vote. It<U+00A0>was always a struggle,<U+201D> said Carlos Duarte, state director for Mi Familia Vota, a group that focuses on registering Hispanic voters and is operating extensively in Houston, Dallas and San Antonio. <U+201C>But this year, not at all.<U+201D> Still, Hispanics have historically voted at lower rates in Texas compared with nationally. Just 39% of eligible Hispanic voters there cast ballots in the 2012 presidential election, compared with about 48% in the rest of the country, census data showed. Early voting in the state started last week, and record numbers Texans have turned out. Harris County saw a 44% increase over the first five days of<U+00A0>early<U+00A0>voting<U+00A0>compared with 2012, according to the secretary of state<U+2019>s office. And in Dallas County, there was a 56% increase over the first five days of<U+00A0>early<U+00A0>voting. <U+2014>Dante Chinni contributed to this article. Write to Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.com",

Reports of Trump lawn signs and banners being stolen and defaced are everywhere on social media. \nMaking matters worse, undercover video evidence emerged showing senior Democrat operatives Robert Creamer and Scott Foval acknowledging using dirty, likely illegal tricks against the Trump campaign. Their goal was to generate negative media coverage of Trump rallies by fomenting violence at them. The media eagerly used the various fisticuffs and melees the Democrats created to attempt to discredit Trump by depicting his supporters as violent, knuckle-dragging crazies. \n{snip} \nDespite their aversion to covering stories that put Trump in a sympathetic light, members of the media had no choice but to cover the extremely newsworthy Oct. 15 weekend firebombing of Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. Gov. Pat McCrory called the arson <U+201C>an attack on our democracy,<U+201D> while one GOP official called it an act of <U+201C>political terrorism.<U+201D> Spray-painted on the building next door were a swastika and the sentence <U+201C>Nazi Republicans get out of town or else.<U+201D> \nMeanwhile, most physical attacks on Trump supporters make only local news outlet<U+2013>if that. Rarely do such assaults get mentioned on the evening TV broadcast news or in The New York Times or The Washington Post. That<U+2019>s because they don<U+2019>t fit the leftist narrative that Republicans are violent, racist, Islamophobic homophobes. \n{snip} \nHere is a compilation of some of the attacks on Trump supporters: \nOn Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, <U+201C>Why can<U+2019>t they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?<U+201D> \nAround Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. <U+201C>The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by <U+2018>some thugs<U+2019> that a barmaid called out from the back.<U+201D> Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a <U+201C>Blue Lives Matter<U+201D> shirt. \nOn Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a <U+201C>Make America Great Again<U+201D> baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. \nOn Sept. 26 at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota, as the first presidential debate was about to get underway, a woman wearing Trump campaign apparel was assaulted while heading to a debate watch event. {snip} \nOn Aug. 19 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Trump supporters had to run a gauntlet of angry protesters to get into a Trump fundraiser at the Minneapolis Convention Center. When they left after the event they were hit, pushed, and spit on. \n{snip} \nOn Aug. 3 in Bloomfield, New Jersey, an assailant attacked a 62-year-old man who was walking down the street wearing a pro-Trump T-shirt, local police said. <U+201C>The motorist inquired why [the man] was wearing the shirt, directing profanities at him,<U+201D> a police spokesman said. <U+201C>The [victim] continued to walk away as [the] motorist followed him.<U+201D> The motorist hit the man several times with a crowbar, causing injuries to his arms, hands, and thighs, \n{snip} \nThis is not an exhaustive list of violent attacks on Trump supporters. \nNo doubt there will be plenty more such assaults in the final two weeks, as Americans head to the polls. \nAnd Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s campaign may be involved in those attacks.",

The handwringing goes like this: The country is deeply divided by schisms that cannot be bridged, every institution from the two parties to the mainstream media to the Department of Justice has been tarnished by cover-ups, collusion or worse; whomever wins the election will enter the presidency without a mandate, and so on. \nWhy is <U+201C>nothing good can come of this<U+201D> good? Because ridding the nation of its political corruption will require hitting bottom. \nJust as an alcoholic or drug addict is incapable of making any truly positive changes until he/she hits absolute bottom, so it is with our tolerance of a corrupt political system that is poisoning the nation, one injection of corrupt cash, collusion and pay-to-play at a time. \nIf our rotten-to-the-core politics as usual is indeed flying off the cliff to complete destruction, that is an unalloyed good. \nJust as alcoholics continue down their self-destructive path with the aid of enablers, so too has the corrupt political order expanded with the aid of the Mainstream Media, insiders in the Department of Justice, K Street lobbyists and a veritable army of well-paid lackeys, pundits, academics, apparatchiks and assorted toadies in the organs of governance and in the big-money private sector and philanthro-capitalist dynasties of pay-to-play foundations. \nThe only way anything will truly change in the political order is if every Establishment insider politico loses every election, from the presidency to dogcatcher. Nothing will change until the mere existence of a private foundation like the Clinton Foundation triggers a landslide loss for the politico with ties to such corruption. \nNothing will change until the collusion of the mainstream media (supplying the insider candidate with debate questions, etc.) alone causes the colluding candidate to lose by a landslide. \nNothing will change until candidates who refuse to accept any donation larger than $100 from anyone or any entity beat the Goldman Sachs/Saudi prince-funded insider candidates by a landslide. \nNothing will change until candidates who fund costly negative TV advertising campaigns with millions in pay-to-play <U+201C>contributions<U+201D> from Goldman Sachs et al. lose by a landslide. \nYou get the point: we the citizens and voters have to stop being enablers of systemic corruption. We have to stop being bamboozled by insiders with promises of <U+201C>hope and change<U+201D> and the usual negative TV blitzes funded by corrupt big money. \nIt<U+2019>s easy to blame lax campaign laws or the corrupted candidates and their insider toadies, but ultimately we<U+2019>re responsible for enabling corruption, collusion, pay-for-play and a political and financial Elite that<U+2019>s above the law. \nFrom the point of view of the corrupted, colluding insiders, MSM flunkies, Department of Justice lackeys and well-paid parrot-pundits, nothing good can come from this election because half the voters may actually cast off the shackles of the nation<U+2019>s corrupt and corrupting political and financial Elites. \nThis mass rejection of the politics as usual of corrupt and corrupting political and financial Elites is the highest possible good <U+2013>a public good that eludes the hand-wringing corrupt insiders, pundits and toadies who have sucked up fortunes from the trough of putrid systemic corruption.",

The pickup in activity suggests the eurozone<U+2019>s modest economic recovery has gained some momentum as 2016 draws to a close, and is another indication that rising levels of political uncertainty are having little impact on the behavior of businesses or households. IHS Markit said its composite Purchasing Managers Index for the eurozone<U+2019>s manufacturers and service providers, which is based on a survey of 5,000 companies, rose to 54.1 from 53.3 in October, its highest level since December of last year and above the 53.4 consensus forecast of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal last week. A reading above 50.0 signals an increase in activity, while a reading below signals a decline. The survey suggests that higher levels of activity will be sustained over coming months, with new orders also rising at the fastest pace this year. <U+201C>Increasing numbers of firms are boosting capacity as a result of the order book backlog, leading to the joint-largest increase in employment seen this side of the global financial crisis,<U+201D> said Chris Williamson, IHS Markit<U+2019>s chief business economist. According to the survey, businesses raised their prices for the first time since August 2015, an encouraging development for the European Central Bank as it struggles to boost inflation to its target of just under 2% from 0.5% in October. A separate survey released Tuesday by the European Commission found that consumers became more optimistic about their prospects in November, shrugging off the uncertainties created by the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president and the prospect of political turbulence across their own continent. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election has raised questions about whether the U.S. will continue to extend the unconditional security guarantee that has underpinned European prosperity since World War II. It also highlighted the possibility that antiestablishment views could receive increased support in a series of coming votes across the eurozone. France, Germany and the Netherlands will hold elections in 2017, with French President Fran<U+00E7>ois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel under pressure from freshly energized populist parties, as well as more traditional rivals. More immediately, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has pledged to resign if voters reject key constitutional changes that aim to slim down the country<U+2019>s legislature and speed up lawmaking in a Dec. 4 referendum. Some economists continue to expect activity will weaken in the early months of next year as political worries bite, and most expect members of the ECB<U+2019>s governing council to announce a continuation of their bond buying program beyond its scheduled end in March when they next meet on Dec. 8. <U+201C>We suspect that growth will slow next year as political uncertainty and a temporary rise in inflation weigh on domestic demand,<U+201D> said Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics. <U+201C>Mindful of these risks, we expect the ECB to announce a six-month extension of its Asset Purchase Programme at the current pace in December and think that tapering is a long way off.<U+201D> The eurozone economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.4% in the three months through September. Economists said the composite PMIs for October and November point to an acceleration in growth to between 1.6% and 2% in the final quarter. Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com",

Now we have audio of Lara Trump, wife of Eric Trump and daughter-in-law of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, saying she believes her father-in-law was behind the latest letter from FBI Director James Comey. Lara Trump: <U+2018>My Father-In-Law Forced Their Hand<U+2019> \nIn an interview on WABC Radio with Rita Cosby, Lara Trump came right out and said, proudly, that she believes Donald Trump was one of the people behind this whole thing: <U+201C>I think my father-in-law forced their hand in this. You know, he has been the one since the beginning saying that she shouldn<U+2019>t be able to run for president, and I commend him on that.<U+201D> \nAnyone who has been paying attention over the past 12 hours or so knows that this <U+201C>scandal<U+201D> died before it even had a chance to really breathe. The conservative media has, of course, attempted to spin this into something real, given the fact that their candidate<U+2019>s chances of winning are less than 10 percent. But the emails are not from Clinton nor are they from Clinton<U+2019>s server. Not only that, but Comey<U+2019>s motivations behind sending the letter seem more and more likely to be politically motivated. Former DOJ Official: <U+2018>You Don<U+2019>t Do This<U+2019> \nComey<U+2019>s actions are unprecedented for an FBI Director. In a piece discussing that very fact, Jane Mayer wrote for The New Yorker : <U+201C><U+2026> His latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities, who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the Presidential and congressional elections. <U+2018>You don<U+2019>t do this,<U+2019> one former senior Justice Department official exclaimed. <U+2018>It<U+2019>s aberrational. It violates decades of practice.<U+2019> The reason, according to the former official, who asked not to be identified because of ongoing cases involving the department, <U+2018>is because it impugns the integrity and reputation of the candidate, even though there<U+2019>s no finding by a court, or in this instance even an indictment.'<U+201D> There was also the tweetstorm from former DOJ spokesperson Matthew Miller, in which he eviscerated Comey<U+2019>s actions. He also wrote a more cohesive piece for the Washington Post , in which he said : <U+201C>With each step, Comey moved further away from department guidelines and precedents, culminating in Friday<U+2019>s letter to Congress. This letter not only violated Justice rules on commenting on ongoing investigations but also flew in the face of years of precedent about how to handle sensitive cases as Election Day nears.<U+201D> All of this makes one wonder <U+2013> what is Comey<U+2019>s motivation here? Comey, a Republican appointed by President Obama, is breaking rules of tradition left and right. And Trump<U+2019>s own daughter-in-law is on record saying that she believes the Republican nominee <U+201C>forced their hand.<U+201D> No matter the motivation, the <U+201C>scandal<U+201D> is dead in the water, no matter how much the Republicans and the Trump campaign wish it were truly the <U+201C>October surprise<U+201D> they<U+2019>ve been waiting for <U+2026> rather than another woman coming forward and accusing their nominee of sexual assault. That number stands at 12 and counting. The Clinton campaign, to their credit, is calling for complete transparency from the FBI in the matter.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Lawrence Davidson \n source: informationclearinghouse.info \n text: Donald Trump<U+0092>s Moment: Will It Last? By Lawrence Davidson\nNovember 11, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - On Election Day, Hillary Clinton, with all her data specialists and poll gurus, came up short. The morning after, they didn<U+0092>t know what hit them <U+0096> that is, the unexpected fact that statistical data and real life don<U+0092>t always coincide. People often tell pollsters what they think the pollsters want to hear, or what media tells them is the expected answer, while clandestinely harboring different opinions that they share only with their family, friends and drinking buddies.\nHillary Clinton and the Democratic leadership, as well as their Republican Party counterparts, represent a well-entrenched political system. That system is responsive to lobbies or interest groups and not disgruntled citizens. What is more, none of the country<U+0092>s political bosses can see beyond this system and how it relates to their own political needs.\nDuring the 2016 election campaign that near sightedness led to a fatal misinterpretation: that Trump represented only hooligans and <U+0093>deplorable<U+0094> people who could not themselves possibly add up to a <U+0093>silent majority.<U+0094> Thinking along these lines, Clinton and the overconfident Democratic establishment made a perhaps unconscious decision to let this apparent bozo Trump lose the election, rather than they, the Democrats, going out there and doing what was necessary to win it.\nFor instance, they apparently did not bother to design a message to compete for the votes of those listening to Trump. They did not take into consideration the historically observable fact that millions of Americans had, over the last 50 years, seemed to give up on politics because they saw the system as unresponsive. The Democrat establishment did not respond to this phenomenon. Indeed, they made sure Bernie Sanders, the only Democratic who was trying to respond, would fail.\nA Deep Division\nThe truth is that the United States is a very deeply divided country, and has been since the 1960s. The division is multifaceted and involves cultural issues that touch on gender, race and lifestyle; and class issues such as job creation and trade treaties. Also, the city mouse/country mouse divide is very real and very deep.\nMuch of rural white America has various degrees of negative feelings toward African-Americans, Latinos, Asians and anyone else who does not look and talk like them. These are the same sort of people who once hated kids with long hair, afros, and a preference for marijuana over whiskey.\nAll of these disgruntled ones, like those millions of Christian Fundamentalists out there, have never gone away. They were just waiting <U+0096> even if some of them didn<U+0092>t know it. They were waiting for a <U+0093>hero,<U+0094> and when he appeared, they elected him president.\nSo the divisions are real and they are not new. And no one in the political establishment, Democrat or Republican, addressed them. That opened the door for Mr. Trump.\nThat means Trump<U+0092>s victory should not properly be seen as a Republican Party victory. Trump just exploited the party label. In truth, he has destroyed the Republican Party as we traditionally knew it. Its future is very uncertain.\nWhat Can We Expect?\nDonald Trump has made a fetish out of being unpredictable, which, at the very least, is bad for the stock market. Inevitably, however, there will be signs that give a hint as to what might be expected.\nFor instance, Trump will have to name a cabinet. Interestingly enough, most of those who will be available, be they private-sector business people or right-wing goofballs like Sarah Palin and Chris Christie, are creatures of the standing political system. They have no real interest in reforming current ways of doing things as against profiting from them <U+0096> which, of course, is a form of business as usual.\nThere will be tremendous pressure on Donald Trump to go along with and slot himself into the existing political system in Washington (as did President Obama). At every turn, in Congress and in the bureaucracies, there will be no one to deal with but systems people.\nBeyond a limited number of exclusively executive functions, Trump needs standing political arrangements to operate. Thus, if he suddenly turns relatively conventional, no one should be too surprised. What about all that campaign rebel talk? Well, remember, he is unpredictable which, in his case, goes well with also being a consistent liar.\nTrump promised a lot during the campaign. He was going to rebuild the inner cities, the military, all of the nation<U+0092>s bridges, etc. And he would do so while simultaneously lowering taxes. Short of bankrupting the country, this is fiscally impossible.\nHe promised to remake foreign policy, which, being within the realm of executive power, may be more doable. Will he try to cancel international trade agreements? Will he pull out of NATO? Will he dump the Zionists and the Saudis? Will he ally with the Russians?\nThese are interesting questions. What about global warming, which he claims not to believe in? How about international law and our relationship to the United Nations? It<U+0092>s all up for grabs, and that worries a lot of people <U+0096> very few of whom voted for Trump.\nMany of those who did vote for Donald Trump don<U+0092>t care about any of this. They voted for him because he appeared to stand against the political system they hate. They want the country ethnically cleansed of Mexicans, the government downsized and, culturally, the clock turned back to the 1950s. If he does not do this, he will appear to have become part of that hateful system, and his fans may well end up hating him too.\nLawrence Davidson is a retired professor of history from West Chester University in West Chester PA.

McCaskill 10/18/16 09:50 AM EDT The State Department on Tuesday vigorously dismissed reports that a quid pro quo was offered to the FBI in exchange for downgrading a classification of one of Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s emails from her private server when she was secretary of state. State immediately sought to refute the claim from an official inside the FBI<U+2019>s records management division who accused Patrick Kennedy, undersecretary of state for management, of pushing to have a classified email downgraded to unclassified last year. In exchange, the official told the FBI that State would allow the FBI to place agents in more countries, though it remains unclear exactly who sought the \"quid pro quo.\" Story Continued Below Mark Toner, a deputy spokesperson at the State Department, denied the allegations Monday in a statement and again during the department<U+2019>s daily briefing. Despite that, though, State trotted out spokesman John Kirby to put cold water on the coal of claims. Kirby toured the morning circuit to reinforce State<U+2019>s position, flatly denying on Fox News, CNN and MSNBC that any quid pro quo had occurred or was even recommended. Kirby downplayed the FBI notes of a possible quid pro quo as the summary of a single interview with a sole FBI employee <U+2014> not facts, not conclusions, not investigation results, but notes. <U+201C>We looked into this. The FBI looked into this, and it<U+2019>s is just not true,<U+201D> Kirby told <U+201C>Fox and Friends.<U+201D> <U+201C>There was no quid pro quo even suggested or any kind of bargain laid on the table.<U+201D> In his series of interviews, Kirby maintained that what did happen is Kennedy called the FBI <U+201C>to get a little bit better understanding about why they wanted one particular email classified secret.<U+201D> State, he noted on CNN, felt the email didn<U+2019>t need to be classified, but the FBI disagreed. <U+201C>The FBI held firm to their position, and the email remained classified. And that, you know, that email redacted is on our website,<U+201D> he said, suggesting people go there to view it themselves. <U+201C>But there was no bargain sought by the FBI. There was no bargain rendered. This was simply an interagency conversation about the classification over one particular email. So there was no wrongdoing here.<U+201D> Kirby explained that a conversation about additional slots for FBI agents in Iraq did occur <U+2014> but separately. <U+201C>That conversation did happen,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Both those conversations happened. But to try to link them together and say that there was some sort of bargain sought is just not accurate.<U+201D> The unnamed official<U+2019>s claim was revealed amid a 100 pages of notes the bureau released Monday from its closed investigation into Clinton<U+2019>s server. <U+201C>[Redacted] received a call from [Redacted] of the International Operations Division (IOD) of the FBI, who <U+2018>pressured<U+2019> him to change the classified email to unclassified,<U+201D> the FBI wrote from its interview. <U+201C>[Redacted] indicated he had been contacted by PATRICK KENNEDY, Undersecretary of State, who had asked his assistance in altering the email<U+2019>s classification in exchange for a <U+2018>quid pro quo.<U+2019><U+201D> By Michael Grunwald By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz",

Barack Obama called Donald Trump <U+201C>Mr. President-elect.<U+201D> Donald Trump called Barack Obama <U+201C>Mr. President.<U+201D> Story Continued Below And the two politicians from the farthest-possible poles in America politics, meeting for the first time, discussed the logistics of the peaceable transfer of power between them, and with it control of the world<U+2019>s mightiest military. For a candidate and a campaign that disregarded custom and shattered political norms with relish from the start, Trump, on his second day as president-elect, stuck closely to the script of the standards expected of presidents-elect. He chatted amicably with Obama. He visited the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill. He announced plans to sit down for his first formal interview, on the venerable <U+201C>60 Minutes.<U+201D> He had tweeted, as of midafternoon, only once. <U+201C>Happy 241st birthday to the U.S. Marine Corps!<U+201D> he wrote. Only days ago, Obama had said that Trump was <U+201C>unfit<U+201D> for the Oval Office, the same place where they chatted on Thursday in leather chairs with a bowl of fresh apples in front of them. Trump has previously called Obama the <U+201C>worst<U+201D> president in U.S. history, and questioned for years his legitimacy as an American citizen. They shook hands anyway on Thursday. By Nolan D. McCaskill <U+201C>If you succeed, then the country succeeds,<U+201D> Obama told him. The meeting was to have lasted little more than 10 minutes, Trump said, but they bantered for an hour and a half. <U+201C>It could have gone on for a lot longer,<U+201D> Trump said. Trump<U+2019>s remarks with Obama were his first since his victory speech early Wednesday morning, when the divisive candidate and self-avowed biggest <U+201C>counterpuncher<U+201D> in the world, declared it was <U+201C>time for America to bind the wounds of division.<U+201D> Gov. Chris Christie, the head of Trump<U+2019>s transition team, said late Wednesday on MSNBC that there was <U+201C>a certain solemnity<U+201D> to victory that he sensed in Trump as they watched the returns roll in on Tuesday night. <U+201C>I could definitely see that in his eyes. He understands now that he is going to be the leader of the free world and <U+2014> all of the responsibilities that come along with that,<U+201D> Christie said. After the White House, Trump lunched with House Speaker Paul Ryan at the Capitol Hill Club and the two walked, stride for stride, through the corridors of the Capitol. It marked the first time all year that Ryan, currently the highest-ranking elected Republican in the nation, and Trump, who will take that title in January, had appeared together in public. President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump meet in the White House. 11/10/16 01:06 PM EST Vice President-elect Mike Pence met separately with Vice President Joe Biden and joined Trump for his meetings on Capitol Hill, along with incoming first lady Melania Trump. Ryan later showed Trump the speaker<U+2019>s private balcony, overlooking the National Mall. It is roughly the same view Trump will see on the day he is inaugurated in a little over two months. <U+201C>We are now talking about how we<U+2019>re going to hit the ground running to make sure that we can get this country turned around,<U+201D> Ryan said. Then he appropriated Trump<U+2019>s signature slogan. <U+201C>And make America great again.<U+201D> Trump also met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and walked the Senate corridors, flashing a thumbs up and giving a brief wave, and declared his top three priorities as border security, jobs and health care, presumably unraveling Obama<U+2019>s signature achievement. \"People will be very, very happy,<U+201D> Trump predicted, promising <U+201C>big league jobs.<U+201D> His first visit to Washington D.C. as president-elect was the subject of fanfare as Fox, MSNBC and CNN all carried live coverage of his plane rolling across the tarmac. But after a campaign in which Trump made attacking the news media a centerpiece of his candidacy, he continued to offer warning signs for an administration that could prove hostile to the press. On Thursday, he broke with tradition and refused to allow what<U+2019>s known as a <U+201C>protective pool<U+201D> of reporters to travel in his motorcade. Jeff Mason, president of the White House Correspondents<U+2019> Association, said the group is <U+201C>deeply concerned<U+201D> and that the decision is <U+201C>unacceptable.<U+201D> <U+201C>In addition to breaking with decades of historical precedent and First Amendment principles, this decision could leave Americans blind about his whereabouts and well-being in the event of a national crisis,<U+201D> Mason said. By Nolan D. McCaskill As Trump glad-handed across the city, there was increasingly intensive jockeying across Washington for top jobs in a Trump administration, including some sharp, early-thrown elbows that mirrored the infighting that marred the Trump campaign itself. Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager, hinted on Twitter that she<U+2019>d been offered a job, for instance, pushing back against a report that she wanted to stay at her polling firm. <U+201C>False,<U+201D> she tweeted. <U+201C>Could it be those <U+2018>sources<U+2019> want the WH job I've been offered?<U+201D> Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, meanwhile, said on CNN that <U+201C>there's probably nobody that knows the Justice Department better than me,<U+201D> signaling his interest in the attorney general post, one for which he is a rumored contender. Another potential attorney general is Christie, who is expected to compete to serve as Trump<U+2019>s first chief of staff, a powerful post to implement the administration<U+2019>s agenda as Republicans hold the White House and both chambers in Congress. Conservatives would hold a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court, too, once a Trump justice is confirmed to the high court. But perhaps the most telling staffing signal was a walk that Trump<U+2019>s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, took around the South Lawn with Obama<U+2019>s chief of staff Denis McDonough. And while Trump played the part of president as he traipsed around the town he will soon run, the billionaire claimed he is eager for the dress rehearsal to be over. <U+201C>I think we<U+2019>re going to see some absolutely spectacular things for the American people,<U+201D> he predicted Thursday. <U+201C>We look forward to starting. In fact, truthfully, we can<U+2019>t get started fast enough.<U+201D> By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

We<U+2019>re trying something new for our readers in Europe: a morning briefing to jump-start your day. What do you like? What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at europebriefing@nytimes.com . Here<U+2019>s what you need to know: <U+2022> Russia is grappling with the fallout from its increasingly aggressive foreign policy. Moscow rejected the findings of an investigation led by the United Nations that found that Syrian forces had used chlorine bombs. It also denied responsibility for airstrikes that hit a school in northern Syria , above, an attack that Ban Ki-moon, the U.N. secretary general, said might amount to a war crime. And documents released by Ukrainian hackers amount to new evidence that Russia had a direct role in creating and directing the rebel uprising in eastern Ukraine. <U+2022> In the U.S. presidential race, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama made their first campaign appearance together. Hacked emails portray Chelsea Clinton as devoted to her parents but also frustrated with the cutthroat world on her family<U+2019>s periphery. Supporters of Donald J. Trump are preparing themselves for the possibility of his defeat on Nov. 8. Some fear their concerns and frustrations will be forgotten. Others believe the nation may be headed for violent conflict . <U+2022> In Oregon, the government suffered a surprise blow after armed protesters were acquitted over their takeover of a federally owned wildlife sanctuary. The jury appeared swayed by the occupiers<U+2019> contention that they were protesting government overreach and posed no threat. <U+2022> The European Union <U+2019>s free trade accord with Canada appears back on track, after Belgium resolved an internal dispute that nearly derailed the E.U.<U+2019>s trade agenda. Concessions include protections for local farmers and a review of how governments settle disputes with investors. For now, the outlook is cautiously optimistic . <U+2022> The future of China <U+2019>s power structure took shape after the ruling Communist Party elevated P resident Xi Jinping to the status of <U+201C>core<U+201D> leader, a title reserved for revered leaders like Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. <U+2022> A landmark deal has led to the creation of the world<U+2019>s largest marine park in the Antarctic Ocean. After five years of talks, 24 countries and the E.U. agreed to ban fishing in an area about the size of France and Spain combined. Business <U+2022> Unemployment in Spain fell below 20 percent in the third quarter for the first time in six years. The acting prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, lost a first confidence vote to form a new government but is widely expected to win a second vote tomorrow. <U+2022> N ew privacy rules in the United States require broadband providers to get permission to collect data on a subscriber<U+2019>s web browsing, app use, location and financial information. <U+2022> Nissan said it would build a new car model at its plant in northeastern Britain, backtracking on an earlier threat that it would not invest in the country if it voted to leave the European Union. <U+2022> Apple <U+2019>s high-end laptop, the MacBook Pro, is getting an overhaul with features adapted from the iPhone. <U+2022> Vine , Twitter<U+2019>s six-second video app, is closing down. The internet is sad . <U+2022> The euro and the pound gained against the dollar. Here<U+2019>s a snapshot of global markets . In the News <U+2022> S ecretly made recordings of Kim Jong-il, the leader of North Korea from 1994 to 2011, are featured in a new documentary, <U+201C>The Lovers and the Despot.<U+201D> [ Los Angeles Times ] <U+2022> The <U+201C>coffee murder<U+201D> case that gripped Indonesia ended with a guilty verdict on live television. [ The New York Times ] <U+2022> Moldovans will go to the polls on Sunday in the country<U+2019>s first presidential election in 15 years. They are being asked to choose between a pro-E.U. and a pro-Russian candidate. [ Newsweek ] <U+2022> R eunification talks in Cyprus could have a breakthrough as Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders meet next month. [ Politico ] Noteworthy <U+2022> When the British government announced a pardon last week for thousands of gay men convicted under an outdated law, George Montague , 93, asked for something else: an apology. Gibraltar just legalized same-sex marriage. Romania<U+2019>s highest court postponed a ruling on the recognition of overseas same-sex marriages. <U+2022> The migrant encampment in Calais, France, was a symbol of Europe<U+2019>s continuing failure to solve the refugee crisis, our editorial board writes . <U+2022> A forged painting attributed to the 17th-century Dutch master Frans Hals has unnerved the art world and raised fears that more such forgeries could be on the market. <U+2022> The oldest member of Japan<U+2019>s imperial family, Prince Mikasa , has died at 100. The emperor<U+2019>s uncle had used a pseudonym to serve as an officer in China and later criticized Japan<U+2019>s aggression there. <U+2022> Two young Yazidi women from Iraq who escaped sexual slavery by the Islamic State and became advocates for women were honored with the Sakharov Prize, the European Union<U+2019>s top rights award. Back Story The trees are losing their leaves. There is a chill in the air, pumpkins are on porches, and fake spider webs are hung as decorations. All signs indicate that fall is in full swing <U+2026> or is it autumn? The season with two names is among the many differences in British and American English. It hasn<U+2019>t always been so. Harvest was used before autumn, by some accounts in the 12th or 13th century. Autumn had joined it by the 16th century , which is also about the time that the terms <U+201C>spring of the leaf<U+201D> and <U+201C>fall of the leaf<U+201D> appeared. They were shortened to spring and fall. But it was later that the divergence of who used what happened. The settlers who colonized North America preferred fall to autumn. Over the years, letter writers to The New York Times have cited British literature in our pages as a reminder of fall<U+2019>s roots. <U+201C>A honey tongue / A heart of gall / Is fancies<U+2019> spring / But sorrows<U+2019> fall,<U+201D> was part of a 1599 poem by Sir Walter Raleigh brought to our attention by a reader in October 1942. So whichever side of the pond you<U+2019>re on, take a moment to enjoy the colors (or colours) of fall <U+2014> er, autumn <U+2014> this weekend. Karen Workman contributed reporting.

Several Native American women leading the march were targeted, dragged out of the crowd, and arrested. One man was body-slammed to the ground, while another woman broke her ankle running from the police. The military and police trucks followed the protesters as nearly a hundred officers corralled the protesters into a circle. Among the arrested were journalists, a 17-year-old pregnant girl, and a 78-year-old woman. \nIn total, more than 140 people were detained in half an hour. It was the largest roundup of protesters since the movement against the pipelines intensified two months ago. A majority of those arrested were charged with rioting and criminal trespass. Overall, close to 300 people have been arrested since protests against the pipeline kicked off over the summer. \nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \nWhen we arrived in Mandan, the jail was so overwhelmed with people that we had to sit on the floor in the jail<U+2019>s common area. Two Native American men were thrown into solitary confinement. A number of women faced humiliating strip searches, which included spreading their body parts and jumping up and down while coughing. We were refused phone calls and received no food or water for eight hours after being arrested. Two women fainted from low blood sugar and another had her medication taken away, causing her to shake and sweat profusely. \nWhen I was released from jail, my camera was missing. When I asked about its whereabouts, a police officer said, <U+201C>Your camera is being held as evidence in a crime.<U+201D> \nThe video footage presented here was shot from the beginning of the march, during the prayer, and ends the moment I was arrested. Many families, nearly all of them Native American, can be seen running for the hills. Many people told me they felt as though they were re-enacting the massacres of the Lakota nation during the westward expansion of the United States, when families were shot in the back as they fled.",

But that misreads Mr. Pence<U+2019>s role in this disastrous GOP season. Mr. Pence isn<U+2019>t his boss<U+2019>s junior political partner. He<U+2019>s his moral enabler. I use <U+201C>enabler<U+201D> in the psychiatric sense, meaning, as Merriam-Webster has it, <U+201C>one who enables another to persist in self-destructive behavior (as substance abuse) by providing excuses or by making it possible to avoid the consequences of such behavior.<U+201D> The enabler gets the kids to school when you<U+2019>re passed out drunk, mops up the mess in the bathroom, pays the bills, and makes things seem OK when they aren<U+2019>t. Enablers like to think of themselves as altruists or heroes. In truth they<U+2019>re accomplices. Mr. Trump doesn<U+2019>t have substance-abuse issues: His problem is the emission, not ingestion, of poison. As we learned from Friday<U+2019>s disclosure of his 2005 exchange with Billy Bush, it gushes out of him at nearly every turn, not least in the patter of casual conversation. In the most hideous of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s now-infamous sentences, it<U+2019>s hard to decide which part is most repellent: the predatory verb <U+201C> grab ,<U+201D> the dehumanized object <U+201C> them ,<U+201D> or the pornographic prepositional phrase <U+201C> by the p<U+2014> .<U+201D> Normal people understand this, which is why Mr. Trump<U+2019>s presidential chances are now next to nil. But his Republican enablers are not normal people. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, variously defended the Republican nominee by invoking Jesus Christ and Monica Lewinsky <U+2019>s stained blue dress, which is the type of disgusting association you<U+2019>d expect from a defrocked priest. Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council brushed aside the controversy by insisting his support for Mr. Trump rested on <U+201C>shared concerns<U+201D> not <U+201C>shared values.<U+201D> That marks a milestone: The president of an organization ostensibly devoted to the preservation of family values has endorsed a man who wants to sleep with other men<U+2019>s wives. And then there<U+2019>s Mr. Pence, a man whose job has been to provide evangelical cover to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s meretricious version of New York values. That<U+2019>s the sort of role he could have assumed the way an ER nurse approaches an Ebola patient<U+2014>out of stern professional duty and through thick rubber gloves. Instead, Mr. Pence has thrown himself into the work with relish, constantly vouchsafing the character of <U+201C>this good man<U+201D> Donald Trump. About most other politicians the claim would be a throwaway line, but in this case it amounts to something else: part self-deception and part outright deception, till the hope and the lie blur. Like every other enabler, Mr. Pence is desperate to make true what he knows is not. On Saturday, after the video eruption, Mr. Pence seemed to have his own moral awakening, refusing to serve as Mr. Trump<U+2019>s surrogate at an event in Wisconsin and hinting that he might pull out of the race if his running mate didn<U+2019>t express sufficient contrition at Sunday<U+2019>s debate. But Mr. Pence<U+2019>s moment of clarity was as short-lived as Mr. Trump<U+2019>s remorse. He now claims he never considered leaving the ticket. What a shame for Mr. Pence to besmirch himself through dogged fidelity to a candidate whose own notions of loyalty are as one-way as his concept of marriage. Then again, maybe I<U+2019>m being too generous to the Indiana governor, whose dismay at Mr. Trump<U+2019>s behavior might be as sincere as Captain Renault<U+2019>s objections to gambling at Rick<U+2019>s Cafe in <U+201C>Casablanca.<U+201D> If Mr. Pence is shocked, shocked to discover Mr. Trump is a cad, then he<U+2019>s a fool. If he isn<U+2019>t so shocked, he<U+2019>s a cad, too. As Benjamin Franklin warned in <U+201C>Poor Richard<U+2019>s Almanack,<U+201D> He that lieth down with dogs shall rise up with fleas. It isn<U+2019>t clear what all this means for Mr. Pence<U+2019>s career. The larger question is what it says about the Republican Party that men like Mr. Pence remain willing to carry Mr. Trump to the finish line<U+2014>and carry his insults, boasts, prejudices, predations, threats and lies with them. My guess is that it means the current GOP is nearly beyond redemption. On Nov. 9 Republican voters will likely wake up to the reality that they have lost the White House, again, and that they have nobody but themselves to blame, again. As with every addict and enabler, the surest path to recovery begins at rock bottom. Write bstephens@wsj.com.",

Authorities did, however, note that the officer was unloading his 9mm Glock inside his home, directly behind the daycare, when it <U+2018>accidentally<U+2019> discharged. \nUp until that point, the staff and parents of the children at KinderCare probably thought that their children were safer being neighbors with a police officer. \nDespite the officer clearly admitting to committing the misdemeanor offense of discharging a firearm within city limits, police have yet to charge him. \n<U+201C>Right now our law department has it and they are reviewing it to see if there should be any charges,<U+201D> Police Chief Jack Davis said Wednesday morning. \n<U+201C>It was a very unfortunate incident for the school, as well as him,<U+201D> he added. \nOutside of skating out of the misdemeanor charge so far, this officer also seems to be avoiding the felony offense of discharging a weapon in a gun-free school zone. \nImagine for a moment that you were cleaning your pistol and all of the sudden, you accidentally squeeze off a round sending the deadly projectile through the wall of a daycare center, in a gun-free zone. \nThere are two possible scenarios that would take place; the first one being that a SWAT team responds and you are killed. The second, less lethal result would be your inevitable arrest and charges of public endangerment, unlawful discharge, illegal use of a firearm, assault with a deadly weapon, terrorism, or a myriad of other charges associated with sending a deadly projectile hurling through walls and near the heads of innocent people. You would immediately be facing fines, jail time, probation, and firearms restrictions. \nHowever, if you are a government agent who<U+2019>s trusted with carrying a deadly weapon into places others cannot, you needn<U+2019>t worry about any of those repercussions as this case will likely prove. \nWhen the Akron Beacon Journal contacted the East Cleveland police department to inquire as to what would happen to this officer, they said their department was unaware of the incident. \n<U+201C>We<U+2019>re just grateful that nobody was hurt,<U+201D> KinderCare spokeswoman Colleen Moran told Ohio.com. So are we. \nAs the gun controllers call for guns to be taken out of the hands of US citizens, what they really mean is they only want cops to have guns.

One of the big winners was marijuana as four new states passed legislation that now allows for recreational marijuana. Those included are Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada and California . With the new law, a person can grow up to 6 plants. \nSince the laws went into effect the very next day, many people who have been charged with marijuana-related crimes are now finding themselves in unfamiliar, but fortunate territory. \nAccording to South California Public Radio , attorney Bruce Margolin said: \n<U+201C>People with possession for sale, possession with the intent to sell, transportation or giving away more than an ounce, or sale of cannabis, would normally face prison time from three to four years. However, now it<U+2019>s been reduced to six months in jail, maximum, and a $500 fine, or both.<U+201D> \nThe Drug Policy Alliance states that over 11,000 people are arrested each year with cannabis-related charges. Part of the Alliances push for the law changing to recreational use is that it would positively impact the lives of these people who were charged with these <U+201C>crimes.<U+201D> Such non-violent crimes should not ruin a person<U+2019>s life. \nThese new laws help to bring this specific issue into focus and will likely be a hot topic around this issue for some time to come. \nWhat should be acceptable for marijuana related charges? In what ways should these charges affect a person<U+2019>s life and their job? If it was a non-violent act, should the charges be less? Should some charges that were filed before the new legislation be entirely dropped? Which ones specifically? All of these questions are what lawyers, courts and defendants are now facing. \nHowever, the new laws are still confusing to even lawyers and the courts. Margolin also said: \n<U+201C>They don<U+2019>t know what<U+2019>s going on. It<U+2019>s like deer with headlights on them.<U+201D> \nWhile there have yet to be any official reports such as this one, it can be assumed that people and the courts in Massachusetts, Nevada and Maine are experiencing the same challenges in adapting to the new norm. \nOther winners in the marijuana legislation on election night were Florida, Arkansas and North Dakota, as they approved medical marijuana laws. The 2016 Election was a game-changer for cannabis. \nWhat do you think about the new laws being passed in these states? How should these laws affect a person<U+2019>s life moving forward? Should there be any special consideration for those with children? In what ways do you see the new laws affecting society in general in those states? How soon will the rest of the nation follow suit now that 8 states, including the biggest one in the U.S. has now passed laws allowing recreational marijuana? At what point does industrial hemp come into the picture? \nLance Schuttler graduated from the University of Iowa with a degree in Health Science-Health Coaching and offers health coaching services through his website Orgonlight Health.

Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, was to appear on \"Fox News Sunday\" and NBC's \"Meet The Press,\" but has been replaced with former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, an avid Trump backer. Story Continued Below RNC chairman Rience Priebus was also to appear on CBS<U+2019>s \"Face the Nation,\" but was replaced by Giuliani. CBS said Trump's campaign \"wanted a campaign person\" to appear on the show. Priebus was also set to speak on ABC's \"This Week.\" Giuliani is appearing instead. Both Priebus and Conway are frequent guests on Sunday morning news shows. Priebus disavowed Trump's comments on a tape that was first released by the Washington Post on Friday. Trump has since offered an apology for the comments. By Michael Grunwald By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz",

Posted On Monday, October 31st, 2016 A weekend marathon of talks between major oil producers failed to finalize plans to implement an output cut, threatening the viability of an agreement reached last month to reduce production by as much as 2%. The talks were also aimed at securing coordinated cuts with producers outside OPEC, such as Russia, the world<U+2019>s largest oil producer. Instead, Iraq and Iran<U+2019>s insistence on exemptions emerged as a big sticking point Friday as those members refused to agree to cut their burgeoning output.

Samuelson \n source: newstarget.com \n text: Doctors prescribe deadly opioid for pain-related issues that aren<U+2019>t even legal share in: Big Pharma , FDA , Harmful medicine , Health , medical marijuana , Pharmaceutical Drug Addiction \nCorruption. Bribery. Death. All three are examined in various news reports on a little known <U+201C>specialty pharmaceutical company<U+201D> called Insys Theraputics. They are currently under legal fire for Subsys, a controversial sublingual spray that disperses fentanyl, a very fast acting opioid that is <U+201C>80 times more potent than morphine.<U+201D> The under the tongue delivery allows the fentanyl to bypass the gastrointestinal system and deliver the opioid directly into the blood stream. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has ruled that Subsys can only be prescribed to help cancer patients gain relief from <U+201C>sudden spikes of excruciating pain.<U+201D> \nSarah Fuller was a 32 year old woman who suffered from anxiety and fibromyalgia . She didn<U+2019>t have cancer. But that didn<U+2019>t stop her doctor from prescribing Subsys for her aches and pains. The fentanyl acted quickly with Sarah<U+2019>s already prescribed Xanax, a benzodiazepine. She died. Her family is suing the manufacturer. But why did Sarah<U+2019>s doctor prescribe a drug that wasn<U+2019>t approved? That<U+2019>s easy to answer. Just follow the money. \nAs Stat reports, the sales of Subsys grew to $331 million precisely because physicians give it to patients that don<U+2019>t have cancer, like Sarah Fuller. Doctors get big dollars to simply talk about the drug over dinner, or lunch. Over $6 million dollars have been paid to doctors and health practitioners for this word of mouth activity. \nTake the example of nurse practitioner Heather Alfonso from Illinois. She was paid $83,000 to <U+201C>go to dinner with a few people,<U+201D> and in response, prescribed $1.6 million dollars of Subsys scripts to patients that weren<U+2019>t suffering with cancer pain. She didn<U+2019>t contest the allegations against her. \nGetting paid to speak isn<U+2019>t automatically a bribe, but it appears to be a consistent theme when it comes to Susbys marketing methods. Alabama prosecutors built a case against Nancy Reed Perhacs, who used to be a sales representative for Insys Theraputics. Ms. Perhacs coordinated speaking fees for a doctor friend, provided he prescribed Subsys. Her take was $700,000. Other investigations about similar practices are ongoing in Kansas, Rhode Island, New York, Oregon, Michigan, Florida and New Hampshire. \nThe chief executive, founder and chairman of Insys Theraputics is billionaire John Kapoor. He<U+2019>s been around the block with other controversial pharmaceutical start ups. Kapoor thinks doctors are <U+201C>all ethical.<U+201D> His new FDA approved drug is a chemically created synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) called Syndros. As states legalize the real medicine in cannabis , THC and CBD oil , this is an important pharmaceutical to boycott. \nSources:",

The Obama Justice Department will not do anything to hold this woman accountable, even though far better people than her have had their careers ended over similar crimes. However, the NYPD isn<U+2019>t under Clinton or Obama<U+2019>s control. Erik Prince, Blackwater Founder and Former Navy Seal, told Breitbart what the NYPD<U+2019>s approach might be. According to some of his well-placed sources in the NYPD, Prince told Breitbart the following: <U+201C>The NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making [in the Anthony Weiner investigation] but they received <U+2018>huge push back<U+2019> from the Justice Department.<U+201D> as per Breitbart . Why is the NYPD involved in the Clinton case? Well, they weren<U+2019>t originally, but they made the initial discovery of the new Clinton emails on Anthony Weiner<U+2019>s laptop. Judging from the amount of information they found on the laptop, it seems the FBI and the State Department had insiders protecting Clinton. Allegedly, the criminal activity found on that laptop is enough to make Al Capone blush. <U+201C>They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,<U+201D> Prince said. Prince even gave some insight as to why FBI Director Comey decided to re-open the investigation. In a nutshell, the NYPD forced his hand. <U+201C>The amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI,<U+201D> Prince said. <U+201C>They said, <U+2018>We<U+2019>re going to go public with this if you don<U+2019>t reopen the investigation and you don<U+2019>t do the right thing with timely indictments,<U+2019><U+201D> Prince explained. <U+201C>NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,<U+201D> Prince elaborated. <U+201C>Weiner and Huma Abedin, his wife <U+2013> the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years <U+2013> have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have <U+2013> they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.<U+201D> Allegedly, some of the crimes the emails reveal include money laundering, lying, and even sex trafficking young children. The NYPD doesn<U+2019>t mess around, so they have appointed a new, unbiased, prosecutor in order to investigate these claims by Erik Prince. If only Lynch<U+2019>s Justice Department knew how to make unbiased appointments. The warning for the voters is simple: if Hillary Clinton is elected, there will a constitutional crisis on our hands. She may very well be the first President to be indicted before her first day in the Oval Office. If these criminal accusations are true, they will lead to such staggering events. It would make Watergate seem like a walk in the park. But, its not too late to do the right thing and avoid all of this. Vote Trump and Hillary will be where she belongs <U+2014> in prison.

The Obama/Clinton/progressive contempt for average voters is woven into their DNA, but is it undeserved? President Obama did, after all, win re-election rather handily. His job approval rating stands today above 50%, not too shabby after years of treating voters as six-year-olds, ignoring Congress, trying to bully the Supreme Court, ruling by executive fiat and overseeing a feeble economic recovery. If Mr. Gelernter is right that President Obama has governed like a stern baby sitter and <U+201C>doesn<U+2019>t give a damn what people think,<U+201D> what does that say about we, the emasculated people, and the state of the nation? Consider, too, that without the Constitution<U+2019>s 22nd Amendment preventing a third run for president, Mr. Obama might be on the way to another victory. Emasculated voters seem reconciled to a new progressive vision of the American way of life and a new world order with America no longer leader of the pack. The profound contempt that the president and Mrs. Clinton share for Americans isn<U+2019>t a deal breaker. If Mrs. Clinton can run on her character as we know it and President Obama<U+2019>s record as we<U+2019>ve experienced it and still win, progressive treatment of Americans as dimwits is more than justified. Frank Allen Charlotte, N.C. I sincerely hope that Prof. Gelernter has nonrevocable tenure. By airing his rejection of the university orthodoxy, he has potentially sabotaged his professional future. At best, he will be subjected to classroom boycotts, accusations of microaggressions, demands for classroom safe-spaces, censure or reprimand. It matters little that his assessments are accurate and ring true. Would that we were all so courageous! Lyle S. Mindlin Okemos, Mich. It is precisely Donald Trump who has emasculated us by failing to offer a reasonable alternative to Hillary Clinton. Jeff Bodenstab Boston What gives anyone reason to think that the Republicans (or Democrats) in Congress will have any sway whatsoever over Mr. Trump? They have been completely flummoxed by him and unable to temper any aspect of his puerile, impetuous and unpredictable remarks. Peter Johnson Woodbury, Conn. Our government was founded during a period we now call the Age of Reason, an age that was committed to thinking and reasoning to come to the best decisions. Let<U+2019>s quit our emotional whining and examine our political truths. And women? We will vote for the better candidate because we do not fear emasculation. Catherine Bennett Portland, Ore. Mr. Gelernter argues that if Mr. Trump acts in the Oval Office the way he has acted for the past 60 years, we can simply impeach him. And therefore Mr. Trump will not act as crazy in the Oval Office as he has on the campaign trail. I can<U+2019>t believe this needs to be pointed out, but the argument that we can just impeach Mr. Trump is possibly the worst argument that can be made for electing anyone to the most powerful office in the world. If Mr. Trump<U+2019>s supporters are already putting impeachment on the table, how about we skip those proceedings and not elect a man who lacks almost all basic qualifications to be president? Jeff Beamer New York David Gelernter seems to forget that we are a democracy. His views aren<U+2019>t supported by the majority of the country, and possibly this is why other people with those views feel left out. In fact, our country was built on immigration and no, that certainly doesn<U+2019>t mean, as Mr. Gelernter claims, that <U+201C>all mankind have a right to camp in your backyard.<U+201D> The vetting process is long and thorough. As a Jew, I shudder to think where I and my ancestors might be today had views like Mr. Gelernter<U+2019>s prevailed. There has always been a xenophobic element in our country that maligned immigrants no matter where they came from. No, Mr. Gelertner, this is 2016 and most of us have finally grown up and recognize that there are individuals of value that are different from us. Howard Brenner Woodmere, N.Y.

Trump has been hosting a parade of potential cabinet appointees in the heavily fortified Trump Tower, also known as White House North. The daily drama is being punctuated and animated by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s provocative early morning tweets. This week on The Run-Up , we devote our show to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s transition into the White House <U+2014> one of the most unusual and unpredictable transitions in recent memory. Michael Barbaro is finally taking some time off <U+2014> he is on vacation this week at an undisclosed location. So I am taking over the microphone this week. I<U+2019>m the chief national correspondent for The New York Times Magazine. Joining me from Washington, where I<U+2019>m normally based, are my colleagues Michael Shear and Julie Davis, two of our crack White House reporters, who are now in their own transition moment, from covering the Obama administration to covering the Trump administration. I<U+2019>m also joined in New York by Charles Homans, the political editor at the magazine. We start by talking about Mitt Romney<U+2019>s public pageant to be appointed secretary of state. Why would he be putting himself through this? Mr. Shear says those who know Mr. Romney say he has <U+201C>a sense of service, partly because of his Mormon faith but also a sense that he wants to serve the country,<U+201D> Given how fiercely Mr. Romney condemned Mr. Trump during the campaign <U+2014> calling him a phony, a con man, a fraud <U+2014> Mr. Shear is just as intrigued by the opposite question: not why Mr. Romney would put himself through this process, but why Mr. Trump would even offer him the job. Ms. Davis has an answer, based on her reporting. <U+201C>One of the things that we know that he said privately about Mitt Romney is that he seems like he<U+2019>s straight out of central casting for secretary of state, which, coming from Donald Trump, is the highest possible praise.<U+201D> We discuss what<U+2019>s in store for Rudy Giuliani, whether Chris Christie is off the scene entirely, what to make of Kellyanne Conway<U+2019>s seemingly scripted <U+201C>going rogue<U+201D> moment and what, generally, we expect from a Trump presidency. <U+201C>I think the institution of the White House and the physical building has a huge impact on its occupants,<U+201D> Mr. Shear says. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s possible that once they move into that building and once they start flying around on the plane and they<U+2019>re in the East Room, that some of the tradition, some of the things that normally happen that presidents do, will start happening.

Donald Trump, meanwhile, isn<U+2019>t seeing a significant turnout boost powered by white voters, though Republicans are seeing positive signs in several Midwestern states. At least 37 million early votes had been cast as of Friday, with at least one million more Democrats than Republicans having returned ballots in the data released so far. The practice has exploded in popularity in recent years: Texas, Georgia, Indiana and Oregon are reporting that a record number of early ballots have been cast, according to the Associated Press. And in Maryland, Minnesota and Tennessee and other states, early turnout has already surpassed 2012 levels. Votes that are cast early are secret and often not counted until Election Day, but many states release party registration information of the voters who have requested and returned absentee ballots or have voted in-person. That means the early-voting numbers don<U+2019>t take into account the behavior of independent voters, nor can they account for voters who are registered with one party but cast ballots for the candidate of another party. Capital Journal is WSJ.com<U+2019>s home for Election 2016 news. Still, early-vote figures can provide some clues into the composition of the voting population, the enthusiasm for a candidate and organizational ability of a political campaign in turning out its supporters. VIEW Interactive In Arizona, where Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s presidential campaign is making a late play, the Hispanic share of the early and absentee vote has increased since 2012. Modeling by the data firm Catalist, which works with Democratic campaigns, shows that Latino early turnout surged to 13% of the electorate as of Tuesday, up from about 11% at the same point in 2012 and about 8% at the same point in 2008. The Clinton campaign is also optimistic about steady Hispanic early-voting participation in Colorado and Nevada. In Nevada, 7.6% of all early ballots mailed in or cast in person have been by Hispanic or Latino voters, according to Catalist. What isn<U+2019>t clear in those states is whether the Clinton campaign has attracted new Hispanic supporters or whether it has simply convinced more Hispanics to cast their ballots early rather than on Election Day. At the same time, there are signs that black turnout may be down slightly in Florida, North Carolina and Georgia<U+2014>a cause for concern among many Clinton supporters that many voters from a key part of the coalition that twice elected President Barack Obama may stay home on Election Day. Black early vote turnout is down 7% in both Florida and North Carolina compared with the same point in 2012. The Clinton campaign never expected to match or exceed Mr. Obama<U+2019>s turnout among black voters who were intensively supportive of him. Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign, said that rules in some states, notably North Carolina, have changed since 2012 and limited early voting options for many of the campaign<U+2019>s supporters. Cutting back the number of early-voting sites <U+201C>harmed our ability to be as effective as we could be in getting African-American early vote in,<U+201D> Ms. Palmieri said, adding that boosting black turnout in the final days <U+201C>is a big priority.<U+201D> For Mr. Trump, there is little sign that the GOP presidential nominee is living up to his promise to turn out vast numbers of new white voters who previously didn<U+2019>t participate in presidential elections. But the Trump campaign is seeing positive signs in the early voting data from several states in the Midwest. In the battleground state of Ohio, for example, many Republican-leaning counties have been either overperforming or staying steady with their 2012 numbers. In two key Democratic-leaning counties, Franklin and Cuyahoga, overall early vote appears to have been lagging<U+2014>though some data suggests that Democrats appear to be making up ground in the final days before the election. By contrast, in three Republican-leaning counties, early ballots appear to be up. Marion County, which was carried by Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, ballot returns are up 25%, while in Warren County, the early vote is up 15%. Early and absentee voting has exploded in popularity in recent years, as Election Day has shifted from a single day in November to a weeks-long and sometimes months-long period where voters can choose from many options to cast their ballots including by mail, at early voting sites or at Election Day polling places. This analysis of early voting data was compiled by multiple sources. First, the nonpartisan U.S. Election Project in partnership with the Associated Press aggregates all the early voting data from across the country as released by some states and local governments. The data firm Catalist, which works with Democratic campaigns, provided comparative data for three western states. Finally, the Republican National Committee and Clinton campaign have been highlighting their strengths in early and absentee voting numbers by state. In Iowa, early votes received from Democrats are down by about 24,000 compared with 2012. The ballots already cast by Republicans in the state are slightly down as well, about 3,000 compared with 2012 as well. The 2012 and 2016 numbers were reported as of the Thursday before Election Day. Both parties are now in the midst of a massive turnout effort to cajole their supporters to the polls. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s travel schedule has been almost entirely focused around motivating supporters in states with early vote. As Election Day nears, the campaign is focusing on states that have limited absentee voting and no early in-person voting, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Mr. Obama will visit New Hampshire for a rally on Monday, while Mrs. Clinton is visiting Michigan and Pennsylvania on Friday. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign has expressed confidence about the early-voting turnout operation the Republican National Committee has put together. <U+201C>The RNC ground game has also done an incredible job of contacting voters and getting them to the polls early to vote for Donald Trump,<U+201D> said Trump campaign manager David Bossie last week. <U+201C>We know that early voting can help us compete right from the outset.<U+201D> <U+2014>Dante Chinni contributed to this article.

By John Bresnahan and Heather Caygle 11/17/16 03:02 PM EST Updated 11/17/16 03:02 PM EST Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is waiting to see whether someone will challenge her for her job. In the meantime, she's reliving her glory days of a decade ago. Story Continued Below With Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, considering running against her <U+2014> the first potential challenge to her hold on the House Democratic Caucus since 2010 <U+2014> Pelosi refused to directly address criticism of her leadership among rank-and-file members. She received good news Thursday afternoon when one potential rival, Rep. Joseph Crowley of New York, said he would not challenge her and will run for caucus chair instead. At a news conference hours before Crowley's announcement, Pelosi declared that she was once speaker of the House <U+2014> and said she knows how to lead Democrats back to the promised land. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t want to respond to that,<U+201D> Pelosi said when asked about the dissent within her caucus. Pelosi was forced to delay leadership elections for two weeks after members pressed for a review of the party's message and tactics during the election. <U+201C>In 2005 and 2006, I orchestrated the take-back of the House of Representatives ... I<U+2019>m very proud to have the opportunity, I know how to do it, how to get it done, but I<U+2019>m not responding to that.<U+201D> <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t see anything about what is being suggested now as anything but the friendship of all of us,\" Pelosi added. \"We are family. I never said unanimity, but I did say unified.<U+201D> By Rachael Bade Pelosi served as speaker from 2006 to 2010, when the Democratic majority was wiped out in a wave of anti-Obamacare fervor. Since then, Democrats' fortunes have been up or down each cycle, but they have never seriously threatened to regain the majority. Democratic leaders blame redistricting, but junior lawmakers say the party is not doing enough to appeal to middle-class white voters. Pelosi also claimed to have the overwhelming support of her colleagues, more than enough to defeat Crowley or Ryan. <U+201C>Without even asking anybody for a vote, I have over two-thirds of the caucus supporting me, \" Pelosi said. <U+201C>When somebody challenges you, your supporters turn out.<U+201D> Pelosi also took a shot at Hillary Clinton for failing to devise an economic message that appealed to suburban and rural voters, although she never used Clinton's name. <U+201C>A lot of it was beyond our control,\" Pelosi said of the election results. Yet this week showed there are chinks in Pelosi's armor. Dissatisfaction with her is at its highest level in a half-dozen years, and she's trying to unveil a new agenda for Democrats as they struggle with the thought of living in a Donald Trump-run Washington. Pelosi would almost certainly defeat any potential threat to her leadership, barring a dramatic reversal in the mood among House Democrats. But she may be forced to make some concessions. Ryan seems on the verge of running against Pelosi. The Ohio Democrat promised a decision sometime Thursday. By Shane Goldmacher and Andrew Restuccia \"I think we need a change. I don't think there's any question about it, I think we need a change,\" Ryan said after a closed-door meeting of House Democrats Thursday. \"I personally don't believe we can win the House back with the current leadership.\" Ryan added: \"I hate to say it, I love Nancy Pelosi, but something needs to be done.\" Crowley, who is line to become Democratic Caucus chairman, is being lobbied to run by the same group of members who sought the delay in leadership elections. Those proceedings have been postponed until Nov. 30. But the New York Democrat refused to say whether he would jump in. \"I continue to appreciate the comments from my colleagues. We continue to learn from them about what took place during this election,\" Crowley said. \"I'm going to continue to listen to my colleagues.\" If Crowley did get in, Ryan would probably pass on the race or drop out if he was already in. Crowley would be the more formidable of the two. But it's unclear whether Crowley or Ryan could dramatically expand their base of anti-Pelosi votes. It is difficult to gauge the level of opposition to Pelosi, but it is likely at least 25 to 30 members. Another two dozen or so are on the fence <U+2014> they will back Pelosi unless a viable challenger emerges. By Michael Grunwald By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz",

Thirty-five percent of respondents said that the criticism of the West was hostile. Every fourth (25%) respondent believes that Western critics often criticize Russia for what they should be criticized themselves . Every fifth respondent (21%) said that Europe and the US have little understanding of life in Russia, \"but they still want to teach us.\"Critical remarks against Russia from Western countries are not worthy of attention, 30% of respondents said. The survey was conducted on October 21-24 among 1,600 people in 137 settlements of Russia.The majority of respondents 74% noted that the West wants to weaken and humiliate Russia by tightening sanctions against the country. According to 13 percent of respondent, the sanctions were imposed on Russia in an attempt to restore the geopolitical balance after Russia reunited with the Crimea. Another five percent believe that the sanctions policy of the West is aimed at ending the war in the east of Ukraine, while eight percent were undecided.At the same time, opinion polls conducted in the last days of October showed an increase in the ratings of the president and the government. The survey showed that the approval rating of the president rose from 78.7 to 81.8% from August to October. Positive assessments of the government's work increased from 53.6 to 58.3%.The Russian parliament's approval rating rose from 39.7% in September to 45.5%.Russia's armed forces have the support of 83.5% of the Russian population.

A look at two of the people who could shape that policy shows that investors might be a bit too optimistic. Given President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s lack of experience and ever-changing positions, the people he puts in place are likely to exert significant influence on policy. One is Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and a potential candidate for Treasury secretary . Even if he stays in Congress, he will be instrumental in shaping any new bank legislation. Another person to watch is Thomas Hoenig, who is vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Mr. Hoenig<U+2019>s name has been making the rounds as a possible pick for Federal Reserve vice chairman for supervision. This regulatory role was never filled by President Barack Obama, but its duties have been de facto filled by Fed governor Daniel Tarullo. Both men have argued publicly that holding more loss-absorbing equity capital is the best way to make systemically important banks more resilient. Mr. Hensarling has proposed legislation that would exempt banks from a broad range of regulations in exchange for holding higher levels of capital. Specifically, he focuses on the <U+201C>leverage ratio<U+201D> of tangible equity to total assets plus off-balance-sheet exposures. This would be more stringent than the current regulatory standards, which measure capital against risk-weighted assets. To qualify for relief, Mr. Hensarling wants banks to maintain <U+201C>tangible equity,<U+201D> defined in the proposal as Tier 1 common equity plus preferred shares, equivalent to 10% of total assets and exposures. Calculations by The Wall Street Journal show that none of the six biggest banks in the U.S. would qualify for regulatory relief under this standard. Collectively, they would fall short by about $115 billion of equity capital. This estimate could undercount the amount of needed capital because it is based on total assets and doesn<U+2019>t take into account off-balance-sheet exposures. J.P. Morgan Chase is short by the most, about $44 billion. But Morgan Stanley <U+2019>s shortfall is biggest relative to its size, at 18% of its market capitalization. The need to issue shares or cut dividends and buybacks to get to the standard suggests they would hesitate to make the trade, even in exchange for substantial regulatory relief. Mr. Hoenig hasn<U+2019>t proposed anything so specific, but in speeches he has argued against lowering capital requirements for systemically important banks. He has also favored use of the more stringent leverage ratio and tangible equity capital. Mr. Hensarling<U+2019>s proposals cite Mr. Hoenig<U+2019>s arguments for inspiration. There are other reasons why big banks are rallying, including higher interest rates and trading volumes. But investors hoping for increased capital returns should temper expectations.

Is it the hateful country they confronted a few weeks before the presidential election, when someone left a note at their door that said, <U+201C>Terrorist Leave no one wants you here<U+201D>? Or is it the generous country of welcoming strangers who heard about their ordeal and showered them with gifts and cards with positive messages? The victory of President-elect Donald J. Trump has intensified their whiplash. After a year in the Maryland suburbs, having arrived with their four children as refugees from Iraq, they find themselves comparing the threats they fled with those that might still emerge. They did not sleep on election night after watching television coverage of the results. They are <U+201C>very afraid and worried,<U+201D> Mr. Lalqaraghuli said on Wednesday. <U+201C>We don<U+2019>t know what this will mean.<U+201D> Their confusion, and the divided response to the family<U+2019>s presence here, mirrors the experience of many other refugee families and Muslim Americans. In the past week, even as advocates report a steep rise in attacks and acts of intimidation against blacks, Muslims and immigrants <U+2014> and on women wearing hijabs <U+2014> many of those episodes have been followed by public acts of support and solidarity. At Baylor University in Waco, Tex., hundreds of students and faculty members walked to class with Natasha Nkhama, a black student, after a friend posted a video of her describing an episode in which she was called a racial slur and forced off a sidewalk by someone who said, <U+201C>I<U+2019>m just trying to make America great again.<U+201D> In Georgia, Mairah Teli, a Muslim teacher at Dacula High School, posted a photograph of an anonymous note she received on Friday that said she should <U+201C>tie<U+201D> her head scarf around her neck and <U+201C>hang yourself with it.<U+201D> A day later, she wrote in another Facebook post : <U+201C>I am overwhelmed and deeply touched by all of the outcry and support that I have received in the past 24 hours. I can<U+2019>t even begin to articulate how touched I am to be receiving messages from all over the country with your support.<U+201D> Acts of hate and intimidation, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, occurred across the country during the campaign, and have increased significantly since Mr. Trump was declared the president-elect. But the back and forth between acceptance and rejection can be particularly confusing for new arrivals like the Lalqaraghulis. Their new home of Dundalk is an inner-ring suburb of Baltimore, one of the many working-class communities where the nation<U+2019>s battles over identity have become most intense. It was once a lively hub of workers filing into plants for Bethlehem Steel, General Motors and other manufacturing giants. Now it is dominated by strip malls. Ra<U+2019>ad Lalqaraghuli said he was initially eager to call it home. <U+201C>When I arrived in America, I was so happy,<U+201D> Mr. Lalqaraghuli, 43, said. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s my dream country for my children.<U+201D> He<U+2019>d had experiences with Americans before. A graduate of Mosul University, in 2004 he began working as a group engineer for American contractors and the United States Army Corps of Engineers to help rebuild his country after the American invasion. A promotion to project manager in 2009 led to his overseeing the construction of water treatment plants and several schools in Baghdad and two cities south of the capital, Nasiriya and Basra. But his work for the Americans also brought him unwanted attention from terrorist groups. He spent one winter sleeping outside in the forest, to keep himself hidden, while his wife and children stayed with her family. Militants from the Islamic State abducted two of his younger brothers and one older brother instead. <U+201C>They said, <U+2018>In exchange for you, we<U+2019>ll give them back.<U+2019><U+201D> He and his father didn<U+2019>t believe them, and the three brothers were killed. His work on behalf of the United States government made him and his family eligible for humanitarian protection under special immigrant visas. Lawyers in New York supported his application, and he received approval quickly. Then, last year, a militia bombed the family home. <U+201C>I lost everything,<U+201D> Mr. Lalqaraghuli said. At the Baghdad airport, heading to the United States, he still worried that he was being followed. All he had was his plane ticket, his passport, $100, and his wife and four children. Betsy Fisher, the deputy policy director of the New York-based International Refugee Assistance Project , which resettled the family, said she was dismayed to learn of its newfound anxiety, especially after the many attempts on Mr. Lalqaraghuli<U+2019>s life for several years by different groups in Iraq. <U+201C>The people who enter this country as refugees are fleeing from terrorism,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>They cannot live in a place with violence.<U+201D> She added of the message posted on the family<U+2019>s door, <U+201C>Not only is a note like this horrifying, it should be deeply embarrassing for every American that this family was threatened, because the reason they are in this country is because he was of service to our country.<U+201D> Advocates <U+2014> like the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which is helping the family <U+2014> say that many refugee families are reluctant to come forward when they become victims of hate crimes because they fear a greater backlash. But after the note appeared <U+2014> with a crude drawing of a woman in a hijab <U+2014> Mr. Lalqaraghuli notified the police, telling an officer in the neighborhood who happened to be on a foot patrol near his apartment. The police said that the note had been written by a 14-year-old neighbor, and that officers had talked to her and her parents but determined that no crime had been committed. The neighbor<U+2019>s family did not respond to a message requesting comment. Criminal or not, the episode was enough to stir up a response <U+2014> an effort to counter intolerance. Alta Haywood, a retired teacher who lives in Perry Hall, Md., sent the family a towering fruit basket and included a note that read in part, <U+201C>I sincerely hope that other people in the area show you that they can be kind and accepting.<U+201D> Another gift-giver, Dr. Lindsay Fitch, said the news of what had happened to the family <U+201C>just grabbed me more personally.<U+201D> While talking to her two children about it, she said, she decided to send the family the most American of welcomes: a home-baked apple pie and a pumpkin pie. Included in her card were a photograph of her family and an invitation to have their families get together. <U+201C>I wanted to welcome you to the Baltimore area,<U+201D> she wrote. <U+201C>There are a lot of people here who want to welcome you with open arms. Hopefully, you<U+2019>ll find that welcome. Remember us when you encounter ugliness.<U+201D> Mr. Lalqaraghuli, who works as a driver, said he greatly appreciated the outpouring of support. But after Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory, he said, it is hard to trust that acceptance will emerge as the country<U+2019>s dominant force. He missed two weeks of work after the note was left, because, he said, his children felt safer when he was around. His youngest, Abdullah, 5, no longer sleeps in his own room. He joins his parents instead. <U+201C>Because he sees when militias come to my home, they come with the weapons,<U+201D> Mr. Lalqaraghuli said. He was referring to their life in Baghdad. But as soon as possible, he said, his family will be looking to move out of Dundalk and start fresh in another town or state. Follow Adeel Hassan on Twitter @adeelnyt .

You couldn<U+2019>t prove a catastrophic loss of wildlife since 1970 by the experience of humans; the animals are still all around us, and many of them are flourishing to the detriment of human-inhabited areas. This report sounds like the tendentious exaggeration of something that is to be expected, but is framed in alarmist terms.] \nThe number of wild animals living on Earth is set to fall by two-thirds by 2020, according to a new report , part of a mass extinction that is destroying the natural world upon which humanity depends. \nThe analysis, the most comprehensive to date, indicates that animal populations plummeted by 58% between 1970 and 2012, with losses on track to reach 67% by 2020. Researchers from WWF and the Zoological Society of London compiled the report from scientific data and found that the destruction of wild habitats, hunting and pollution were to blame. \nThe creatures being lost range from mountains to forests to rivers and the seas and include well-known endangered species such as elephants and gorillas and lesser known creatures such as vultures and salamanders. \nThe collapse of wildlife is, with climate change, the most striking sign of the Anthropocene, a proposed new geological era in which humans dominate the planet. <U+201C>We are no longer a small world on a big planet.

But the presstitutes have done the next best thing for Hillary. They have made Comey the issue, not Hillary. \nAccording to US Senator Harry Reid and the presstitutes, we don<U+2019>t need to worry about Hillary<U+2019>s crimes. After all, she is only a political woman feathering her nest, just as political men have done for ages. Why all this misogynist talk about Hillary? The presstitutes<U+2019> cry is that Comey<U+2019>s alleged crime is far more important. This woman-hating Republican violated the Hatch Act by telling Congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened. A very strange interpretation of the Hatch Act. During an election it is OK to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not OK to say that a candidate is under investigation. \nIn July 2016 Comey violated the Hatch Act when he, on orders from the corrupt Obama Attorney General, announced Hillary clean. In so doing, Comey used the prestige of federal clearance of Hillary<U+2019>s violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls. \nActually, Hillary<U+2019>s standing in the polls is based on the pollsters over-weighting Hillary supporters in the polls. It is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions. If you look at the crowds attending the two candidate<U+2019>s public appearances, it is clear that the American people prefer Donald Trump, who is opposed to war with Russia and China. War with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election. \nHillary<U+2019>s problem has the ruling American Oligarcy, for which Hillary is the total servant, concerned. What are they going to do about Trump if he wins? Will his fate be the same as John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, George Wallace? Time will tell. Or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the Oligarchy got rid of Dominique Strauss-Kahn? \nAll of the American and Western feminists, progressives, and left-wing remnant fell for the obvious frame-up of Strauss-Kahn. After Strauss-Kahn was blocked from the Presidency of France and resigned as Director of the IMF, the New York authorities had to drop all charges against Strauss-Kahn. But Washington had succeeded in putting its French vassal, Sarkozy, in the presidency of France. \nThis is how the American Oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests. The corrupt self-serving Oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media, the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities, and, of course, through the presstitutes, Americans<U+2019> minds. \nThe Oligarchs are now hard-pressed to rescue Hillary as US president, so let<U+2019>s see if the Oligarchs can once again deceive the American people. \nWhile we wait, let<U+2019>s concern ourselves with another important issue. The Clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the 20th century allowed a small handful of mega-corporations to consolidate the US media in a few hands. This vast increase in the power of the Oligarchy was accomplished despite US anti-trust law. The media mergers destroyed the American tradition of a dispersed and independent media. \nBut really, what does federal law mean to the One Percent. Nothing whatsoever. The One Percent<U+2019>s power makes them immune to law. Hillary<U+2019>s crimes might cost her the election, but she won<U+2019>t go to jail. \nNot content with 90% control of the US media, the Oligarchy wants more concentration and more control. Looks like they will be getting it, thanks to the corrupt US government. The Federal Trade Commission is supposed to enforce US anti-trust law. Instead, the federal agency routinely violates US anti-trust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests. \nBecause of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law, we now have <U+201C>banks too big to fail,<U+201D> unregulated Internet monopoly, and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media. \nNot so long ago there was a field of economics known as anti-trust. Ph.D. candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power. I assume that this field of economics, like the America of my youth, no longer exists. \nRahul Manchanda explains that <U+201C>yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another huge media conglomerate, to create another gargantuan media outlet, in another consolidation of the enormous power, money, wealth, intimidation, conspiracy and control<U+201D> that eviscerates the US Constitution and the First Amendment.

Too much imbalance in wealth distribution, severe economic depression, and Government Pretense of a 'recovery' that fooled nobody.\" \nAdd in free trade ideas and shipping jobs to the cheapest labor markets in the world leaving ordinary citizens out of work and you've got a lot of anger. \nAdd in Obamacare with its premiums going up and the Pharmaceutical Industry leaping up its profit margins--more anger. \nAdd in stupid wars with the only logic behind them making money for the munitions people and The War Establishment--more anger. \nAdd in refugees fleeing somewhere, anywhere, with their countries either blasted economically or from continuing, monstrous war--more anger. \nAdd in Washington-As-Usual with its talking heads and scoffing and labeling its opposition ignorant and stupid--more anger. \nThe Brexit people across the Atlantic are calling out: \"Welcome to the Club!

There has never been much question that if Mrs. Clinton returned to the White House as president, Ms. Abedin would come too. Now with Ms. Abedin again part of unwelcome attention, even some Democrats are wondering if Mrs. Clinton might be forced to rethink Ms. Abedin<U+2019>s role if she is elected president, and whether a cloud would linger over her if Ms. Abedin were to take a senior White House job, as has long been expected. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said Friday it had found additional emails potentially related to the probe, completed this summer, of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s private server when she was secretary of state. The new emails come from a laptop that investigators believe was used by Ms. Abedin and her estranged husband, former Rep. Anthony Weiner, and were found during an investigation of Mr. Weiner for allegedly exchanging sexually explicit text messages and photos with a 15-year-old girl. Ms. Abedin now finds herself as a central character in a late-breaking drama that has added an unpredictable factor into what many people in both parties saw as an election heading toward a Clinton victory. Some Democrats said Sunday they had no doubt Mrs. Clinton would bring Ms. Abedin with her to the White House. Others said her future may depend on what the renewed investigation finds. It is possible the emails are purely personal, were already turned over to investigators, or are duplicates of messages already examined, meaning the long-term damage to Mrs. Clinton<U+2014>and Ms. Abedin<U+2014>may be minimal. More serious findings could have more significant ramifications. And the process of reading the messages, which may number in the thousands, will take weeks and won<U+2019>t be completed until well after Election Day. Democrats point to Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s loyalty to her friends and staff, many of whom have been with her for years. Ms. Abedin, who is said to be personally closer to the candidate than any other adviser, is often described as akin to a second daughter. On the campaign, Ms. Abedin has been involved in anything involving Mrs. Clinton personally, including speeches, statements, meetings and debate preparation. She manages the candidate<U+2019>s large network of contacts and serves as gatekeeper, determining who and what gets through to her. <U+201C>She<U+2019>s played a central and vital role in this campaign,<U+201D> Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said Sunday on CNN<U+2019>s State of the Union. <U+201C>And she continues to do that and continues to do her work running our overall scheduling and advance operation, being a confidante to senior people in the campaign, and traveling with Hillary.<U+201D> Ms. Abedin wasn<U+2019>t on the road this weekend, but is expected to return to Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s side in coming days. At rallies this weekend, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump repeatedly mentioned Ms. Abedin by name. <U+201C>Is she going to keep Huma?<U+201D> Mr. Trump asked Saturday in Golden, Colo. <U+201C>Huma<U+2019>s been a problem. Do we agree? Huma. Huma<U+2019>s been a problem. I wonder if Huma<U+2019>s going to stay there.<U+201D> The timing of this disclosure, just days before the election, is particularly uncomfortable for Ms. Abedin. But it isn<U+2019>t the first time she has been under scrutiny, and it is far from her first public embarrassment. Because she had a personal email address on the Clinton family server, conservative groups have been able to obtain, through lawsuits, all of Ms. Abedin<U+2019>s correspondence. They have also gotten many of her emails from her State Department account. Several of them show Clinton Foundation officials asking her for favors. That has led Mr. Trump to charge that there was a <U+201C>pay to play<U+201D> scheme at work, in which supporters of the foundation may have obtained favors from the department. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign has said her decisions as secretary of state were unrelated to requests from the foundation and its supporters. Ms. Abedin also has been under investigation by Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) for an arrangement under the Special Government Employee program, which allowed her to simultaneously work for the State Department, Mrs. Clinton personally, the Clinton Foundation and a private consulting firm called Teneo, which was founded in part by a former foundation official. The program was created to allow agencies to give short-term jobs to individuals from the private sector with a particular expertise, and Mr. Grassley has argued that using it in Ms. Abedin<U+2019>s case was an abuse. The State Department has said Ms. Abedin<U+2019>s work for Teneo was unrelated to her work for the government, and that her outside employment while at State was arranged so the government wouldn<U+2019>t be paying her for work she did charting Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s post-State career. But the actions of Mr. Weiner, whom Ms. Abedin married in 2010, are the most personal and likely the most painful public controversy she has confronted. In 2011, the New York lawmaker resigned from Congress after admitting he had sent salacious photos and messages over the internet to other women. Ms. Abedin, who was pregnant at the time, opted to stay with him, and was by his side in 2013 when he attempted a political comeback. During his campaign for mayor of New York City, it was disclosed that he had continued exchanging sexually explicit messages with other women after he left Congress<U+2014>a story chronicled in a documentary that Ms. Abedin participated in, which was released this summer. The New York Post reported this summer that Mr. Weiner had sent yet another provocative picture, this time sending a photo of himself in his underwear to a woman while their 4-year-old son was lying next to him in bed. After that, Ms. Abedin announced she was leaving him. In September, the FBI opened its investigation of him after a report that he had exchanged messages with a minor. It was that probe that led to the discovery of the new emails and, ultimately, to Friday<U+2019>s announcement, a development that is rocking the campaign of the woman to whom Ms. Abedin has devoted her career.

K. Galbraith\nLast month, tensions between dark matter simulations and galactic rotation observations reached a new high. Despite all the successes of dark matter on the largest scales <U+2014> for the CMB, for large-scale structure, for gravitational lensing and for galaxy clusters, among others <U+2014> the simplest dark matter simulations reproduced unrealistic results for how individual galaxies ought to rotate. Moreover, a team of scientists uncovered a surprising relationship: between the normal (baryonic) matter alone and the observed acceleration in galaxies.\nThe correlation between gravitational acceleration (y-axis) and the normal, baryonic matter (x-axis) visible in an assembly of 153 galaxies. The blue points show each individual galaxy, while the red show binned data.

From https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05917v1.pdf.\nIf dark matter were real, then the simulations needed to reproduce that result as well, which appeared to be a tremendous challenge. Yet in a new paper, two scientists from McMaster University, Ben Keller and James Wadsley, did exactly this. Even more impressively, they didn<U+2019>t make new simulations, they simply took pre-existing ones and showed that this relation does, in fact, get reproduced among all their galaxies.\nWhile the web of dark matter (purple) might seem to determine cosmic structure formation on its own, the feedback from normal matter (red) can severely impact galactic scales.

Prof. Hall has been the target of a witch hunt mounted by Facebook and by B'nai Brith Canada. The mission of the Canadian branch of the Anti-Defamation League is to provide Zionist advocacy for \"the security of Israel.\"\nIn late August of 2016 a maliciously engineered smear item was placed on Prof. Hall's FB page without his knowledge or consent. The B'nai Brith immediately publicized the offensive content of the post to introduce a concerted smear and disinformation campaign implying falsely that Dr. Hall seeks to \"Kill All Jews.\" The B'nai Brith exploited its grotesque misrepresentation of Dr. Hall's academic work to call on its membership to flood the administrative offices of the University of Lethbridge with letters and petition signatures. The object is to remove Dr. Hall from his teaching post. Dr. Hall remains a tenured full professor whose career as a university teacher began in 1982.\nThe University of Lethbridge's administration soon surrendered to this Zionist campaign aimed at disabling an outspoken critic of Israel's genocidal treatment of the Aboriginal Palestinians. On Oct. 4 the U of L president, Dr. Mike Mahon, suspended Dr. Hall without pay. He undertook this assault on the principles of academic freedom in the complete absence of any due process of third-party arbitration whatsoever.\nThe attack on Dr. Hall is an attack on the institution of academic tenure, a mainstay of protection for academic freedom in institutions of higher learning. The University of Lethbridge Faculty Association and the Canadian Association of University Teachers have identified the illegal nature of Dr. Mahon's unprecedented assault on the core principles of tenure and academic freedom.\nIn his talk sponsored by the Mohawks of the Grand River, Dr. Hall put the Zionist/Facebook campaign directed at disabling critics of Israel in a broader historical context. The assault on the Palestinian people extends the genocidal holocaust directed at the Indigenous peoples of the Americas since 1492. Israeli techniques directed at terminating the Palestinian presence draw on the genocidal techniques directed at Native Americans in the expansionary course of US history.\nWRITER\nProf. Tony Hall Dr. Hall is editor in chief of American Herald Tribune. He is currently Professor of Globalization Studies at University of Lethbridge in Alberta Canada. He has been a teacher in the Canadian university system since 1982.

Eventually, the true number was found to be over 22 million e-mails. \nSalon reports that: \nThe emails had been run through private accounts controlled by the Republican National Committee and were only supposed to be used for dealing with non-administration political campaign work to avoid violating ethics laws. Yet congressional investigators already had evidence private emails had been used for government business, including to discuss the firing of one of the U.S. attorneys. The RNC accounts were used by 22 White House staffers, including then-Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, who reportedly used his RNC email for 95 percent of his communications. \nAccording to the Washington Post, <U+201C>Under federal law, the White House is required to maintain records, including e-mails, involving presidential decision- making and deliberations.<U+201D> But, of course, these millions of e-mails went missing <U+2014> many of which were important evidence. \nMost troubling, researchers found a suspicious pattern in the White House email system blackouts, including periods when there were no emails available from the office of Vice President Dick Cheney. \n<U+2018><U+201C>That the vice president<U+2019>s office, widely characterized as the most powerful vice president in history, should have no archived emails in its accounts for scores of days<U+2014>especially days when there was discussion of whether to invade Iraq<U+2014>beggared the imagination,<U+201D> says Thomas Blanton, director of the Washington-based National Security Archive. The NSA (not to be confused with the National Security Agency, the federal surveillance organization) is a nonprofit devoted to obtaining and declassifying national security documents and is one of the key players in the effort to recover the supposedly lost Bush White House emails. \nAs Rove and others were investigated for the partisan <U+201C>unmasking<U+201D> of Valerie Plame, a CIA black market specialist, it came to light that Rove<U+2019>s server was used for official communications <U+2014> the exact sort required to be preserved under the Presidential Records Act. \n<U+201C>I wouldn<U+2019>t rule out that there were a potential 5 million e-mails lost,<U+201D> White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said at the time. By 2009, it was revealed that Perino<U+2019>s numbers were a little off when 22 million missing e-mails were discovered. \nThe partisan nature of this Clinton email investigation is obvious. How is it not relevant that an administration notorious for committing war crimes and crimes against humanity was able to delete millions of emails without a word from Congress? For all their so called concern for our national security, the Republican Party has an appalling double standard.",

Tim Kaine, as a future partner in the White House and hinted at an outsize role he may play in her potential administration. The former Virginia governor already is playing such a part in the campaign by energizing activists in his home state and helping the Clinton campaign save time and money in what once was a Republican stronghold. While Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s recent lead has tightened in other battleground states, she maintains an advantage in this swing state of about 9 percentage points, double the margin before she named Mr. Kaine to her ticket, according to a Real Clear Politics average of polls. <U+201C>There was a lot of excitement leading up to his selection, and the response has been overwhelming,<U+201D> Democratic state Sen. Jeremy McPike said. Mr. McPike said hundreds of supporters are planning a pilgrimage<U+00A0>on Tuesday<U+00A0>to Farmville, Va., where Mr. Kaine and his Republican counterpart, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, will briefly eclipse the tops of their respective tickets during the only scheduled debate between the vice-presidential nominees. Vice-presidential candidates usually add little significant political value to their running mate<U+2019>s campaign. But it is unusual for a presidential candidate to select her No. 2 from such a consequential battleground as Mr.<U+00A0>Kaine<U+2019>s home state, said Kyle Kopko, co-author of <U+201C>The VP Advantage: How Running Mates Influence Home State Voting in Presidential Elections.<U+201D> <U+201C>There<U+2019>s never been anything this clear,<U+201D> Mr. Kopko said about the importance of the Kaine nomination on the electoral map. <U+201C>I just cannot think of anybody better to have by my side on the campaign trail, in the White House,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton said about her running mate in July. <U+201C>We are going to take on the challenges that are hurting Americans. We are going to give the middle class a raise. We are going to give tax relief to working families.<U+201D> Even before his addition to the ticket, an influx of new voters had helped loosen Republicans<U+2019> hold on the Old Dominion. The arrival of Latino, Asian-American and college-educated voters to the state<U+2019>s northern suburbs near Washington, D.C., helped deliver the state to Barack Obama in 2008<U+2014>the first Democratic presidential nominee to win there since Lyndon Johnson in 1964<U+2014>and again in 2012. In 2013, Terry McAuliffe <U+2019>s victory in the governor<U+2019>s race gave Democrats control of all three of the statewide constitutional offices<U+2014>governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general<U+2014>and both U.S. Senate seats for the first time in more than 40 years. Still, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is treating Virginia as a top priority. Either he or Mr. Pence have traveled to the state about once a week since the Republican National Convention in July. His campaign, along with some help from the National Rifle Association, aired about $3 million in TV ads in the state last month. <U+201C>Virginia is a very important state,<U+201D> Mr. Trump told supporters during a Sept. 6 campaign stop in Virginia Beach. <U+201C>We have to win.<U+201D> Corey Stewart, the chairman of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign in Virginia, said the Republican<U+2019>s team will start advertising in the state soon. <U+201C>Virginia is a must-win state,<U+201D> Mr. Stewart said. <U+201C>Our ground game finally, since Labor Day, has started to coalesce. We got a bit of a late start, but it<U+2019>s going to be very strong.<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, hasn<U+2019>t set foot in Virginia since her convention, spending her increasingly valuable time almost exclusively in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Her campaign suspended her TV advertising campaign in Virginia in August. Instead, Mrs. Clinton has leaned on visits by her surrogates. Chelsea Clinton, the former secretary of state<U+2019>s daughter, campaigned in Roanoke on Sept. 14. During a campaign stop last week in Fairfax, first lady Michelle Obama criticized Mr. Trump for questioning of her husband<U+2019>s U.S. citizenship and rallied young voters to get out to the polls on Election Day. Mr. Kaine, a fluent Spanish speaker, has been dispatched mostly to Florida, where the campaign is trying to run up the margins with Hispanic voters. But he has also campaigned around Virginia, making stops in Richmond, where he was mayor; in the Richmond suburb of Henrico County; and in Norfolk. He was in Alexandria last week when his campaign won the endorsement of Republican John Warner, a former U.S. senator who credited his three-decade relationship with Mr. Kaine as part of his reason to cross the partisan aisle. Mr. Warner spoke of Mr. Kaine in the kind of patriotic and religious tones usually reserved for fellow Republicans, saying he has a strong <U+201C>family tradition,<U+201D> that he follows <U+201C>church and God,<U+201D> and embodies <U+201C>the principles that have kept this country strong.<U+201D> <U+201C>He exemplifies what this country needs foremost,<U+201D> Mr. Warner told reporters. In Richmond, Mr. Kaine earned a reputation as a moderate for his votes to ban lap dancing and making it tougher to open adult bookstores, in addition to his support of some abortion restrictions. As governor, Mr. Kaine also pursued gun restrictions after the 2007 mass killings at Virginia Tech and won a smoking ban in restaurants. He specialized in housing discrimination lawsuits as a civil-rights lawyer, and he was selected mayor by a Richmond City Council that was mostly African-American. State Sen. Bryce Reeves, a Republican who is running for lieutenant governor, said Mr. Kaine understands the <U+201C>Virginia way of doing business<U+201D> and <U+201C>isn<U+2019>t the type of politician who throws grenades.<U+201D> <U+201C>But make no mistake about it, his colors are on the Clinton side,<U+201D> Mr. Reeves said, adding that that many Virginia Republicans were motivated to keep him out of the White House. <U+201C>Virginians are a microcosm of America, and they<U+2019>re very angry. And Trump has been the voice for those people, not Hillary Clinton.<U+201D> Virginia Democratic Party Chairwoman Susan Swecker said Mr. Kaine<U+2019>s nomination has increased enthusiasm in Virginia for a ticket that is struggling to energize supporters in other battleground states. She said there was a noticeable uptick in volunteers for phone banking and canvassing immediately after he was selected. <U+201C>Tim<U+2019>s attended the community festivals, the forums and we<U+2019>ve gotten to know him,<U+201D> said Walter Tejada, a Democratic consultant in Virginia. <U+201C>Democrats are excited, and even more energized than before.<U+201D> Write to Michael C.

There were more than 600 direct rape threats, she said. \nHampstead and Kilburn MP, Tulip Siddiq, said she too received regular online abuse including threats on her life. \nOne-time Labour leadership hopeful Angela Eagle was the target of homophobic abuse after challenging Jeremy Corbyn earlier this year. Her Wallasey constituency office was also vandalized when someone threw a brick through a window. \nFormer Prime Minister David Cameron was once accused of sexist behavior towards Eagle after he told her to <U+201C>calm down, dear<U+201D> during a Commons debate. \n<U+201C>If a woman speaks loudly in parliament, she is <U+2018>shushed<U+2019> with a finger to the mouth. That never happens when a man speaks loudly,<U+201D> a European parliamentarian interviewed by the IPU said. \nRead more \nThe IPU study also showed that more than one in five of all politicians quizzed has experienced sexual violence during their term, and one in three had witnessed attacks on colleagues in parliament. \nAlmost 80 percent said they had been psychologically abused, causing them to suffer panic attacks or permanent trauma. \nAccording to the IPU report, female politicians <U+201C>said they must constantly deal with old-school thinking about their appearance, how they express themselves and behave, and the role they should play.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>More generally, their excessively or insufficiently feminine demeanour is a subject of regular and widespread comment, attacks and derision. The same is true of their conjugal status, emotional, sexual and family life, imagined or real,<U+201D> it added. \nDespite this, the majority of women surveyed said the abuse would not stop them from running for another term in office. \n<U+201C>Parliaments need to put their own house in order if they want to lead by example and stop discrimination and violence against women in all walks of life,<U+201D> said Chungong. \n<U+201C>The effectiveness of parliaments, progress toward equality between men and women and the vitality of democracy itself all depend on it. \n<U+201C>The parliamentary community must speak out against sexism and harassment, and make clear that it cannot be tolerated as the price to be paid for women<U+2019>s political involvement.<U+201D> \nVia RT .

Patrick Murphy listens as Sen. Marco Rubio answers a question during their Senate debate. | AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee By Marc Caputo 10/27/16 07:21 PM EDT Florida voters appear ready to ticket-split in favoring Democrat Hillary Clinton for president and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio in his reelection, according to a new survey of likely voters from the University of North Florida. In the presidential race, Clinton leads Donald Trump 43-39 when Libertarian Gary Johnson (6 percent) and Green Party candidate Jill Stein (3 percent) were polled by UNF. But Clinton<U+2019>s 4-point lead shrinks to 2 in a head-to-head matchup against Trump. That<U+2019>s well within the 3.8 error margin for the poll of 696 likely voters. Story Continued Below <U+201C>There is almost no change from our poll in early October in which Clinton led Trump by three percentage points, 41<U+2013>38, in the four-way contest, but the head-to-head results have tightened considerably,<U+201D> said Dr. Michael Binder, faculty director of UNF<U+2019>s Public Opinion Research Laboratory. Though Republicans and Democrats each were exactly 40 percent of the poll respondents, Binder wondered if the final election will bring out slightly more Democrats because they<U+2019>re turning out in bigger numbers than usual and casting more early and absentee ballots relative to this point in the election. As of Wednesday morning, 2.5 million people had already voted, with Republicans still holding an edge over Democrats in ballots cast. Republicans accounted for about 41 percent of the pre-Election Day ballots cast compared to the Democrats 40.5 percent. Usually, Republicans have a bigger lead because their voters are more accustomed and adept at casting absentee ballots by mail. But Democrats are catching up and, after this upcoming first full weekend of in-person early voting, many expect the total number of Democratic ballots to exceed Republican ones. <U+201C>If this trend continues through Election Day, Clinton could expand this margin and easily win Florida,<U+201D> Binder said. Most Florida polls this month have shown Clinton ahead. A Bloomberg Politics<U+2019> survey released Wednesday showed Trump winning by 2 points. Unlike the UNF poll that had the same number of Democratic and Republican respondents, the Bloomberg survey had more Republicans than Democrats. But Rubio appears as if he might survive. He leads Congressman Patrick Murphy, 49-43 percent. And he has yet to trail in a Florida poll in months. <U+201C>Rubio is maintaining his six percentage point lead from our poll earlier in the month. Rubio can attribute his lead to support from NPAs and more Democrats willing to cast a ballot for him than Republicans are for Murphy,<U+201D> Binder said. UNF also polled a medical-marijuana initiative and found it received 73 percent support. <U+201C>This is down four percentage points from our last poll, but still well above the 60 percent threshold needed for passage. Interestingly, and just like in our last poll, all age groups and parties support Amendment 2,<U+201D> Binder said.

By Ben White 11/08/16 10:53 PM EST Updated 11/09/16 10:36 AM EST NEW YORK -- Wall Street regained some of its footing Wednesday morning after Donald Trump<U+2019>s shocking victory in the presidential race sent global markets into a tailspin in the overnight hours. The Dow opened slightly higher then rose around 150 points by mid-morning as investors and traders attempted to digest a political thunder clap with potentially enormous ramifications for the U.S. and global economy. Story Continued Below The New York Stock Exchange took technical steps on Wednesday to try and smooth potential volatility while officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve were closely monitoring trading following the most shocking presidential upset in American history. Trump<U+2019>s remarkable sweep to victory sent stock market futures down by as much as 800 points overnight while the Mexican peso suffered some of its worst ever losses and gold and the Japanese yen soared as investors rushed to safety. But as the initial shock wore off, futures began to recover as Wall Street began to look for positives in Trump presidency including on infrastructure spending and potential individual and corporate tax relief. Trump<U+2019>s low-key victory speech early Wednesday morning also served to calm markets somewhat. Still, investors now expect a period of intense volatility given the emotional nature of the 2016 campaign and the blank slate that a Trump win and complete GOP control of Congress present. <U+201C>My overriding take from the Trump victory is that he has made uncertainty great again,<U+201D> said Douglas Kass, founder and president at Seabreeze Partners. <U+201C>We are going to see intra-day volatility for the next couple of weeks and maybe even longer because there is so much uncertainty about his policies and the degree of cooperation he will get from Congress. His leadership skills and ability to appoint high-quality people are also totally unknown. This is going to be a very emotional time.<U+201D> Donald Trump's full remarks on the election night. 11/09/16 04:24 AM EST As of 11:30 a.m., the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock market indices were all slightly higher. Action in the Treasury market suggested uncertainty over the short-term outlook as yields on short-term debt dropped while longer-term yields rose. This appeared to suggest that investors believe Trump will pursue a spending agenda on infrastructure and tax cuts that will require more government borrowing. Investors also looked for positives in the stocks of banks and biotechnology companies that might have suffered under a stricter regulatory regime under a potential Clinton presidency. But investors suggested any kind of Trump rally on Wall Street will likely have to wait until more is known about how he will govern. <U+201C>Investors don<U+2019>t like uncertainty and Trump<U+2019>s presidency embodies uncertainty,<U+201D> BMO Private Bank<U+2019>s Jack Ablin wrote in a note to clients. <U+201C>Emotions will dominate market action over the next several trading days, potentially leading to exaggerated market swings. Foreign markets, particularly China, Japan and Mexico will bear the brunt of investor angst.<U+201D> Market strategists also suggested that Trump<U+2019>s win could cause the Federal Reserve -- widely expected to raise interest rates in December as wages rise and unemployment falls -- to rethink its policy position. <U+201C>While the Fed is independent and therefore does not consider political developments in its rate decisions, it does consider the economic implications of political developments,<U+201D> Manulife Asset Management<U+2019>s Megan Greene wrote in a note on Wednesday. <U+201C>Given the high degree of policy uncertainty and the heightened probability of a US recession under a Trump presidency, we expect the Fed will not hike rates this year.<U+201D> The initial losses on Wall Street following Trump<U+2019>s win came after a big rally Monday as polls appeared to suggest Clinton would cruise to victory. The panic selling initially resembled reaction to the Brexit vote over the summer when the UK shocked pundits by choosing to leave the European Union. As with Brexit, most on Wall Street underestimated the degree to which voters angry with elites and the status quo would take a risk on a candidate that exit polls showed most voters viewed as far less prepared for the White House than Clinton. That left investors badly exposed to the shocking election result. <U+201C>Investors got caught on the wrong foot as the Orange Swan appeared,<U+201D> said Kass, referring to Trump<U+2019>s signature hair color and the <U+201C>Black Swan<U+201D> theory of markets in which widely unexpected events shatter people<U+2019>s view of the world.

Mr. de Blasio, who supported Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton , has long been critical of Mr. Trump , describing him as <U+201C>dangerous<U+201D> and unfit to lead the country. Last year, Mr. Trump called Mr. de Blasio <U+201C>the worst mayor in the U.S.<U+201D> On Wednesday, aides to the mayor said he met alone with the president-elect for 62 minutes in an office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. Mr. de Blasio described the meeting with Mr. Trump as <U+201C>candid<U+201D> and <U+201C>respectful.<U+201D> A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump didn<U+2019>t respond to a request for comment. The mayor said he <U+201C>tried to provide perspective of the NYPD,<U+201D> as he expressed concerns about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plans on immigration, telling him deportations would cause a rift between communities and law-enforcement that would make the city less safe. Mr. de Blasio said he told Mr. Trump the city was <U+201C>never going back<U+201D> to the widespread use of the policing tactic known as stop-and-frisk, an approach Mr. Trump has said should be expanded but that critics say unfairly targets minorities. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a close ally of Mr. Trump who is said to be under consideration for secretary of state , said New Yorkers had nothing to fear. <U+201C>They shouldn<U+2019>t be afraid. They should realize a Trump presidency will make the country safer,<U+201D> Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, said in a phone interview Wednesday. <U+201C>Maybe if they did a little more stop-and-frisk [across the country] they wouldn<U+2019>t have somebody shot every two hours in Chicago.<U+201D> Mr. Giuliani said if Mrs. Clinton had won the presidency, <U+201C>there<U+2019>d be a lot of Republicans that would be afraid of what she would do.<U+201D> <U+201C>I think you have to give the man a chance,<U+201D> he said. Outside Trump Tower on Wednesday, as dozens of tourists and reporters waited outside, aides to Mr. de Blasio said the mayor met alone with the president-elect in an office for 62 minutes. In the days since Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election, Mr. de Blasio has said he would greet the Republican with an open mind and work with him where they had areas of agreement, such as building infrastructure. But he said he would vigorously oppose any of the president-elect<U+2019>s policies he believed hurt New Yorkers. <U+201C>I would be swift to react any time an action was taken that would undermine the people of New York City,<U+201D> he said. As Mr. de Blasio emerged from his meeting with Mr. Trump to dozens of waiting reporters and tourists, he was asked whether he was concerned that security around the tower made it difficult for nearby retailers to do business. <U+201C>I will not tell you that Gucci and Tiffany are my central concerns in life,<U+201D> the mayor quipped in response. The mayor said he would hold a news conference with the police commissioner on Fifth Avenue security on Friday. Write to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.com",

I<U+2019>m not sure why the FBI is dealing with jailbait Skype camgirls, but I guess it<U+2019>s because they were in different states. \nOn that computer we have the documents which the FBI is now claiming are of some import to the Clinton email scandal.

An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll completed last week shows Hillary Clinton with a 50-point lead over Trump among Hispanic likely voters, 67 percent to 17 percent, in a four-way race that also includes Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party<U+2019>s Jill Stein. In a head-to-head matchup with Johnson and Stein removed, Clinton leads Trump 70 percent to 17 percent among Latinos likely to vote. Story Continued Below Trump has struggled to connect with Hispanic voters from Day One of his presidential campaign, when he suggested in his kickoff speech that undocumented immigrants from Mexico were rapists and drug dealers. Trump later suggested that a federal judge could not fairly hear a case against him because of his Hispanic heritage, a remark that House Speaker Paul Ryan referred to as the <U+201C>textbook definition of a racist comment.<U+201D> More recently, Trump defended his past remarks about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who the Republican nominee mocked as <U+201C>Miss Piggy<U+201D> because of her supposed weight gain and <U+201C>Miss Housekeeping<U+201D> because of her Hispanic heritage. As Election Day draws closer, Latino respondents to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll said they are growing more interested in the White House race. Sixty-nine percent of Hispanic respondents said they are very interested in the presidential election, a 9 percent increase from a poll taken last month. Just 13 percent of Latinos polled said they view Trump favorably, compared with 80 percent who view him unfavorably. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll was conducted from Oct. 10-13, contacting 300 Latino registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.66 percent.

According to economist Steven Stoft, who created a series of graphs charting job creation under each party over the last 72 years (during which time Democrats and Republicans have held control for 36 years each), Democrats have created 58 million jobs while Republicans can only claim 26 million . \nFor roughly the last century, electing a Democrat has been the better option for the economy, with Dems creating more than double the jobs than that of Republicans, and faster. \nEven when taking the percent change of number of jobs held, or scaling population (to avoid counting an increased population, thus falsely indicating an increase in jobs), Democrats still prove more successful than Republicans in job creation, and by a wide margin. \nAnother way of studying job creation is to take unemployment into account. When a Democrat is in the White House, logically unemployment decreases as well. By this rational, of course, when a GOP takes the Oval Office unemployment rises (and has risen under this party) since 1945. \nIndeed, this extends to state and federal levels<U+2014>the top 20 years of national GDP growth have all been under a Democrat. This is not only true for GDP, but for all economic growth in general<U+2014>extending to the stock market, income growth and debt as a percentage of GDP. \nAs if you needed more proof that the blue party is better for the economy, simply turn to the numbers over the last 70 years.

The Democratic presidential nominee would concentrate her tax agenda on fewer than 1.5 million households by adding layers of taxation and sealing gaps that let some of their earnings get taxed relatively lightly. She would impose the highest marginal tax rates on top earners since the 1986 revamp of the tax code and boost taxes on business income, investments and estates. She would cap tax breaks while targeting a series of narrower tax-avoidance and -deferral techniques used in the real-estate and private-equity industries. The Democrat sees having the rich pay more as a way to pay for tax breaks and expanded benefits for middle-income families, and she has said households earning less than $250,000 wouldn<U+2019>t see a tax increase. Her proposals add up to about $1.9 trillion in tax increases over a decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s tax proposals, and those of her rival, Republican Donald Trump, are likely to be discussed in Sunday<U+2019>s second presidential debate. She has argued for using the tax system to combat rising inequality, and she returned to that argument in a new ad after Mr. Trump in the first debate said it was <U+201C>smart<U+201D> that he hadn<U+2019>t paid taxes in some years. Mr. Trump has pitched deep tax cuts and a repeal of the estate tax, and he told Mrs. Clinton at the first debate, <U+201C>You are going to drive business out.<U+201D> The Clinton tax plan would advance nearly all of President Barack Obama <U+2019>s unfinished business on taxing high-income households. Then she would adopt Sen. Bernie Sanders<U+2019>s structure for a higher estate tax and tack on a few ideas of her own, such as a 4% surcharge on income over $5 million. More so than the current tax code or Mr. Obama<U+2019>s proposals, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s policies are targeted specifically at the ultrawealthy. <U+201C>This is skewed very, very heavily toward the top end,<U+201D> said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s<U+2026>a little bit like shooting a mouse with a machine gun. She really is designing this so it<U+2019>s very hard to avoid tax on your income at the very top.<U+201D> Overall, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s proposal would add about 4% to federal tax collections over the next decade and push taxes as a share of the economy higher but not past the post-World War II peaks. But the brunt of that impact would fall on a sliver of the population, with nearly 80% of the higher taxes hitting the top 1% of households and more than half hitting the top 0.1%, according to the<U+00A0>Tax Policy Center. The center, using a broader definition of income than is shown on tax returns, sets about $732,000 in annual household income as being in the top 1% and $3.8 million for the top 0.1%. The Tax Policy Center analysis doesn<U+2019>t yet include her most recent proposals, such as taxing unrealized capital gains at death and implementing a 65% tax on estates exceeding $500 million a person. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s proposals, even if she were elected, would face strong resistance in Congress, where Republicans are almost assured of retaining control of at least the House and where Democrats haven<U+2019>t acted on some of the ideas Mr. Obama tried to advance. The share of U.S. income earned by the top 1% has roughly doubled over the past 30 years, according to estimates by economist Emmanuel Saez and others. The top 1% now get about 17% of the nation<U+2019>s income before taxes and pay 28% of federal taxes as a result of the progressive tax code, according to the Tax Policy Center. That is in part the result of changes Mr. Obama pushed through Congress, which the<U+00A0>White House says<U+00A0>increased average tax rates on the top 0.1% of households by nearly seven percentage points. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s proposed tax increases, in combination with tax breaks for parents, caregivers and people with out-of-pocket health care costs, would make the U.S. even more reliant on high-income taxpayers than it is now. A proposal to impose a minimum 30% tax rate on households with incomes over $2 million would prevent people from paying low tax rates by getting the majority of their money from investments. Another change would apply the 3.8% tax created in the 2010 health law to active business income. The repeal of what is known as the step up in basis would tax appreciated assets when given as gifts during life or death, applying the income tax in a place it doesn<U+2019>t reach now. Mrs. Clinton also could also use rules, Internal Revenue Service enforcement priorities and narrower proposals to Congress to go after arcane tax-avoidance techniques. <U+201C>Whenever we see them, we are attacking specific loopholes in the tax code,<U+201D> said Michael Shapiro, an economic policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton. Other than the changes in taxation at death, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s plans don<U+2019>t do much to address the ways wealthy Americans can increase their net worth without reporting taxable income, said Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s a big disconnect between taxable income and the real income of rich people,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>That requires more fundamental reform of taxation than adding four points on the top bracket.<U+201D> Her proposals send the campaigns back into longtime arguments: What happens to the economy when you cut taxes at the top? Republicans see the growth in the 1980s and the late 1990s growth after capital gains rate cuts as proof that people are more willing to save, work and invest if they can keep more of what they earn. <U+201C>When the pie is as large as possible, then you have the least questions about the distribution of that pie,<U+201D> said Donald Luskin, chief investment officer at Trend Macrolytics. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re not having a serious economically driven conversation about this. We<U+2019>re just having a populist appeal.<U+201D> Democrats and other analysts point to the economic expansions after the 1993 and 2013 tax increases as proof that those links between top tax rates and growth are tenuous at best. <U+201C>When you look at periods of extremely strong growth in the United States, there was a tax system that was more progressive than what we<U+2019>re proposing,<U+201D> Mr. Shapiro said.

The new batch of documents indicated that in one particular case, a senior State Department official, Patrick F. Kennedy, pressed the F.B.I. to agree that one of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s emails on the 2012 Benghazi attack would be unclassified <U+2014> and not classified as the bureau wanted. What remained unclear from the documents was whether it was Mr. Kennedy or an F.B.I. official who purportedly offered the <U+201C>quid pro quo<U+201D>: marking the email unclassified in exchange for the State Department<U+2019>s approving the posting of more F.B.I. agents to Iraq. Officials at both the F.B.I. and the State Department said Monday that no deal had been struck, or even offered, over the classification of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s private emails. They noted that the Benghazi email in question had been made public with a sentence blocked out, meeting the F.B.I.<U+2019>s demand for classification. They also said no additional F.B.I. agents had been posted overseas. There is no indication from the documents that Mrs. Clinton was aware of the discussion. Donald J. Trump and other Republicans nonetheless quickly seized on the new documents as evidence of what Speaker Paul D. Ryan called <U+201C>a cover-up.<U+201D> The F.B.I.<U+2019>s latest release of 100 pages of internal investigative files prolonged the intense public scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s use of a private email server as secretary of state, which has been perhaps more damaging to her presidential campaign than any other issue. The new documents also cast particular attention on the role of Mr. Kennedy, a State Department civil servant for more than four decades, in working to oversee the review and public release of tens of thousands of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s private emails. One of the F.B.I. reports said State Department employees who reviewed nearly 300 of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s emails on the Benghazi attacks in early 2015 in response to requests from Congress had <U+201C>felt intense pressure<U+201D> from Mr. Kennedy and other senior State Department officials to complete their review quickly and <U+201C>not label anything as classified.<U+201D> Mr. Kennedy was part of a long-running battle between the State Department and the intelligence agencies over Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s emails. As the emails were prepared for release, officials from the intelligence agencies argued in some cases that information in them should have been marked classified, while State Department officials countered that they contained the routine business of American diplomacy. State Department officials, who argue that the intelligence agencies are overzealous in classifying information, remain sensitive to criticism that they were sloppy in handling the material. In one of the newly disclosed documents, an unidentified F.B.I. employee told investigators that Mr. Kennedy, through another F.B.I. official, had sought in one case <U+201C>assistance in altering the email<U+2019>s classification in exchange for a <U+2018>quid pro quo.<U+2019><U+201D> The F.B.I. had deemed the email classified, but the State Department disagreed. The employee told investigators that <U+201C>in exchange for marking the email unclassified, State would reciprocate by allowing the F.B.I. to place more Agents in countries where they are presently forbidden,<U+201D> according to the F.B.I.<U+2019>s summary of the employee<U+2019>s questioning by investigators. A second F.B.I. interview included in the documents provides a somewhat different version of the dispute over the classification of the Benghazi email, with the suggestion that the F.B.I. <U+2014> and not Mr. Kennedy <U+2014> had offered to make a deal. In the interview, an unidentified F.B.I. official in the international operations division said Mr. Kennedy had complained to him that the F.B.I. classification of the document <U+201C>caused problems for Kennedy<U+201D> and that Mr. Kennedy had wanted to give it a different designation and file it in the State Department basement <U+2014> <U+201C>never to be seen again.<U+201D> The unidentified F.B.I. official said he was the one who then <U+201C>told Kennedy he would look into the email matter if Kennedy would provide authority concerning the F.B.I.<U+2019>s request to increase its personnel in Iraq.<U+201D> The email they were struggling over was sent on Nov. 18, 2012, by William V. Roebuck, who oversaw the department<U+2019>s office for North Africa and is now the American ambassador to Bahrain. In it, he notified five other officials of the arrest of <U+201C>several people<U+201D> in Libya on suspicion they were connected with the Benghazi attack two months earlier. It was subsequently forwarded to senior officials at the department and then to Mrs. Clinton on her private email account by her deputy chief of staff, Jake Sullivan, with a short <U+201C>f.y.i.<U+201D> note. Mark C. Toner, a State Department spokesman, said that no favors had been exchanged in the discussions of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s emails, and that there had been no change in the number of agents in Iraq as a result of the conversations. <U+201C>The allegation of any kind of quid pro quo is inaccurate and does not align with the facts,<U+201D> Mr. Toner said. The F.B.I. also said there was <U+201C>never a quid pro quo,<U+201D> but it said the accusations had been referred to the bureau<U+2019>s inspection division, which handles internal ethics issues, to investigate. The F.B.I. official who discussed the issue with Mr. Kennedy has since left the bureau, an official said. One of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s foreign policy advisers, Michael T. Flynn, a retired general who headed the Defense Intelligence Agency, said the documents provided <U+201C>undeniable proof<U+201D> that Mrs. Clinton had <U+201C>colluded with the F.B.I., D.O.J. and State Department to cover up criminal activity at the highest levels.<U+201D> Two prominent members of the House <U+2014> Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Devin Nunes of California, the chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence <U+2014> called on Secretary of State John Kerry to relieve Mr. Kennedy of his position pending an investigation. In a letter to Mr. Kerry, they accused Mr. Kennedy, the State Department and the F.B.I. of collusion. They charged that the State Department had altered its normal process in reviewing Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s emails, consulting directly with the Justice Department and bypassing the F.B.I.<U+2019>s input. A spokesman for Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign, Jason Miller, said Mr. Kennedy should resign. Mr. Toner said Mr. Kennedy would remain in his position with the full support of Mr. Kerry. After the email issue emerged in March 2015, Mrs. Clinton insisted for months that she had never sent or received emails that contained classified information. But she was forced to backtrack, as the F.B.I. concluded this summer that at least 110 emails had contained classified information, even if they had not been marked as such at the time. Correction: October 20, 2016 Because of an editing error, a headline on Wednesday about a former F.B.I. official at the center of the latest controversy over Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s private emails referred incorrectly to comments he made about his involvement. While he said he did in fact offer to trade favors with the State Department about an email classification issue last year, he also said that he quickly dropped the offer once he realized it involved the 2012 Benghazi attacks and Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s emails. He did not admit to a <U+201C>quid pro quo<U+201D> specifically over Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s emails.

So why not release in 2015? In March? Why wait till October?\" Cruz tweeted. | Getty In late-night phone calls, Cruz deliberated with advisers about how to deal with the release of a lewd Trump tape. By Katie Glueck and Brent Griffiths 10/09/16 06:53 PM EDT Updated 10/09/16 06:51 PM EDT ST. LOUIS <U+2014> For Ted Cruz, the timing couldn<U+2019>t have been worse. Two weeks after Cruz offered a reluctant and belated endorsement of Donald Trump, the Republican nominee had finally gone too far for the rest of the party. Following the release of a lewd tape in which Trump was overheard bragging about sexually assaulting women, a cascade of Republican lawmakers were jumping ship. Story Continued Below But Cruz had just endorsed, and risked further shredding the reputation he has long sought to cultivate <U+2014> that of a principled conservative <U+2014> by backtracking as soon as others in the party did, especially after upsetting a slice of his supporters by endorsing Trump in the first place. In phone calls with advisers Saturday that stretched well into the night, he debated whether to rescind his endorsement or to try simply changing the subject by going on offense against the media, according to a Cruz source with knowledge of the conversations. Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier denied that there was discussion of any strategic pivot to attacking the media. Still, on Sunday morning, Cruz tweeted, <U+201C>NBC had tape 11 yrs. Apprentice producer says they have more & worse. So why not release in 2015? In March? Why wait till October? #MSMBias<U+201D> The question of whether to rescind the endorsement had been tabled. <U+201C>NBC had tape 11 yrs,<U+201D> Cruz tweeted. <U+201C>Apprentice producer says they have more & worse. So why not release in 2015? In March? Why wait till October? #MSMBias<U+201D> But while Cruz has thus far kept his endorsement in place, sources haven<U+2019>t ruled out the possibility of his eventually recalling it. The conversations broke up Saturday night with no conclusions reached, a source said. 2016 By John Bresnahan and Burgess Everett <U+201C>Access Hollywood,<U+201D> whose former host Billy Bush eggs on Trump in the video, began searching through its archives last week after an Associated Press story quoted former staffers and cast members from <U+201C>The Apprentice<U+201D> who said Trump was <U+201C>lewd and sexist.<U+201D> But before \"Access Hollywood, which is owned by NBC, and the network<U+2019>s news division could run their stories, footage of Trump and Bush on a bus in 2005 was leaked to The Washington Post, and the story blew up on Friday. It broke exactly two weeks after Cruz finally endorsed Trump under considerable pressure from supporters and party leaders, after holding out all summer. Following a bitter primary fight in which Trump called Cruz<U+2019>s wife ugly and linked his father to John F. Kennedy assassination theories, Cruz spent months refusing to endorse Trump even as most of his party <U+2014> and certainly his supporters home in Texas <U+2014> got in line. At Trump<U+2019>s Republican National Convention, Cruz took the stage and urged attendees to vote their consciences, rather than support the man the delegates were there to nominate. But pressure mounted on Cruz following the convention and going into the post-Labor Day stretch. Republican activists back home were furious that their senator wasn<U+2019>t doing everything he could to prevent Hillary Clinton from being elected, and major donors had made their displeasure clear. In a move that several of his top advisers and friends opposed, Cruz issued a Facebook post on Sept. 23 in which the senator pointed to Trump<U+2019>s assurances that he would appoint conservative Supreme Court justices, and underlined his commitment to stopping Clinton. But since then, Trump<U+2019>s fortunes have taken a hit, and prior to the release of the lewd audio, Cruz found himself in the awkward position of boosting Trump following both a disastrous first debate performance and a week in which the GOP nominee spent much of his time feuding with a former Miss Universe. By Gabriel Debenedetti When the audio of Trump making deeply derogatory remarks about women, Cruz condemned the content. <U+201C>These comments are disturbing and inappropriate, there is simply no excuse for them,<U+201D> he tweeted. <U+201C>Every wife, mother, daughter <U+2014> every person <U+2014> deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.<U+201D> On the campaign trail, Cruz himself had taken issue with Trump<U+2019>s long history of denigrating remarks about women, and had often championed his own wife, Heidi <U+2014> a Goldman Sachs executive <U+2014> and his mother, who had a career as a computer programmer at a time when few women worked in that field. People who know Cruz said he was genuinely and deeply bothered by Trump<U+2019>s remarks. There may well be more cause to re-evaluate the endorsement: A former producer of Trump<U+2019>s reality-TV show tweeted that <U+201C>far worse<U+201D> is yet to come out about the Republican nominee. <U+201C>As a producer on seasons 1 & 2 of #theapprentice I assure you: when it comes to the #trumptapes there are far worse. #justthebegininng,<U+201D> Bill Pruitt tweeted on Saturday.

They extend to the shopping, entertainment and lifestyle choices of each party<U+2019>s members. People in the counties where President-elect Donald Trump performed best are likely to watch Country Music Television and the Hallmark Channel. Those in the counties where Hillary Clinton did best tend to tune into HBO and Showtime. People in Mr. Trump<U+2019>s top counties prefer Samsung smartphones, while those in Clinton counties like Apple<U+2019>s iPhone. The Trump counties turn to Fox News for information, while Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s look to CNN and the New York Times . Pictures of the widely disparate consumer worlds of Trump and Clinton voters come from data provided by Simmons Research , a consumer-research firm, for the 25 counties where Mr. Trump drew the highest percentage of the vote and the 25 where Mrs. Clinton drew her largest shares of the vote. The data covered only counties with populations of 20,000 or more. To be sure, the data show correlations between political leanings and consumer habits, not causal behaviors. There are Trump voters who prefer CNN as a news source and Clinton voters frequently tune in to the Hallmark Channel. Much of the consumer divide is tied to the kinds of places Trump and Clinton voters tend to live. Some of the differences arise from geography<U+2014>some retail chains are more prevalent in Republican-leaning than Democratic states, for example.<U+00A0>Others reflect differences in income, population density and local culture between red and blue regions. <U+201C>The differences are astounding,<U+201D> said Tamara Barber, senior manager for custom analytics at Simmons. <U+201C>They are crystal clear. The levels of diversity. The size of the counties. Where they shop. There is not a lot of crossover.<U+201D> When they go for fast food, people in Trump<U+2019>s top 25 counties favor Sonic Drive-In or Hardee<U+2019>s, while those in Clinton<U+2019>s top 25 prefer Chipotle and Panera Bread. The differences are reflected in leisure activities, as well. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s top counties are partial to archery and woodworking, while Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s counties lean toward yoga and martial arts. The racial diversity and other demographic characteristics of Trump and Clinton counties vary widely. Among Mr. Trump<U+2019>s top 25 counties, only one has a white, non-Hispanic population below 70%. Among Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s top 25, only one had a white, non-Hispanic population above 70%. In none of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s 25 counties did 30% of the adult population have a bachelor<U+2019>s degree, while in 18 of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s top 25 counties, more than 30% of the adult population has a bachelor<U+2019>s. The Clinton counties also tend to feature higher incomes and bigger populations. Manhattan, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. are all on the list of places that gave Mrs. Clinton the largest share of their votes, while Mr. Trump<U+2019>s contain a collection of smaller, mostly Southern counties, such as Winston County, Ala., and Gray County Texas. As niche marketing and segmentation have come to dominate consumer culture, America<U+2019>s political divides are tied to ground-level differences that may make it harder to create political unity.<U+00A0>Coming up with a message to reach both the Trump and Clinton counties is a difficult challenge, Ms. Barber said. <U+201C>I<U+2019>d say you need to have very different strategies for these two groups, maybe different products,<U+201D> she said. John Besmer, a principal at Planet Propaganda, an advertising firm in the swing-state of Wisconsin, said he sees some chances to bridge the divide. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think people wake up thinking, <U+2018>I want to be an awesome Democrat today.<U+2019> People are all seeking happiness,<U+201D> he said. He said, however, that the people living in the top Trump and Clinton counties could have very different ideas of what makes happiness. A few activities seem to draw equal interest both from Trump and Clinton counties, the Simmons data suggest. Among them: playing football and bowling. And more than 60% in both groups say they enjoy listening to music. Just don<U+2019>t ask what<U+2019>s playing in their headphones. Trump<U+2019>s counties favor country and western. Clinton<U+2019>s like urban adult contemporary. Write to Dante Chinni at Dante.Chinni@wsj.com",

        "input": "time: null \n author: JANE PERLEZ \n source: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/world/asia/donald-trump-china-trade-security.html?_r=0 \n text: BEIJING <U+2014> As a presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump talked about China almost solely in the context of trade, such as when he promised to slap punishing tariffs on cheap Chinese imports that he argued had ruined the lives of working-class Americans. But as he begins to feel the weight of office on his shoulders, there are signs that his focus in the Asia region may have shifted toward security <U+2014> specifically, the problem of North Korea and its expanding nuclear arsenal, which experts say already threatens America<U+2019>s regional allies, Japan and South Korea. During his visit to The New York Times this week, Mr. Trump referred obliquely to a <U+201C>big problem for the country<U+201D> that President Obama had mentioned during their 90-minute meeting at the White House after the election. Well-placed American officials believe that reference was to North Korea. Any solution to that problem must involve China, North Korea<U+2019>s patron, American and Chinese officials agree. Mr. Trump acknowledged as much during the campaign, saying on one occasion that China should do more to bear down on the North. So which tack will Mr. Trump take with China? Will he seek its support for a deal on North Korea, or will he start a trade war, putting such cooperation in doubt? American officials briefed the Chinese several months ago on their assessment that the North <U+2019>s nuclear capabilities had sharply increased , according to two Americans with knowledge of the briefings, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. But even before then, nuclear scientists from China and the United States had agreed for some time about the danger posed by the North<U+2019>s ambitions, said Siegfried S. Hecker, an American nuclear scientist at Stanford University who was the last outsider to visit the country<U+2019>s plutonium processing plant at Yongbyon, in November 2010. Several years ago, the Chinese tended to play down the North<U+2019>s nuclear capabilities, Dr. Hecker said in an email exchange. But since the mercurial Kim Jong-un, a young leader who has declined to listen to China and has provoked the United States, took over the country, the assessments of the two powers have been <U+201C>pretty much in line,<U+201D> he said. Dr. Hecker and other scientists estimate that North Korea might develop the capacity to strike the West Coast of the United States with a nuclear warhead in about five years. But the real problem is here and now, in Asia, he said. <U+201C>The greatest and most urgent threat comes not from a North Korean nuke being able to reach the U.S., but rather what they have already,<U+201D> he said. Specifically, Dr. Hecker wrote in a recent article , the North is now probably able <U+201C>to put nuclear weapons on target anywhere in South Korea and Japan and even on some U.S. assets in the Pacific.<U+201D> Worse yet, he wrote, North Korea may have developed a <U+201C>false sense of confidence<U+201D> from a recent spate of successful nuclear and missile tests <U+2014> one that could lead it to grave errors of judgment. By the end of this year, Dr. Hecker estimated, the country is likely to have enough fissile material for about 20 bombs. The danger would be exacerbated if the North decided <U+201C>to field tactical nuclear weapons as its arsenal expands and its confidence in its nuclear arsenal grows.<U+201D> In short, Dr. Hecker said, more and better bombs make a catastrophic miscalculation by North Korea more likely. How much of this Mr. Trump knew before his victory is unclear, but he was certainly aware of the problem. Early on, he expressed a mixture of awe and dismay toward Mr. Kim. <U+201C>If you look at North Korea, this guy, I mean, he<U+2019>s like a maniac, O.K.?<U+201D> he said at a rally in Ottumwa, Iowa, in January. <U+201C>And you<U+2019>ve got to give him credit. How many young guys <U+2014> he was like 26 or 25 when his father died <U+2014> can take over these tough generals?<U+201D> Mr. Trump was referring to Mr. Kim<U+2019>s execution of several generals, including his uncle, Jang Song -t haek , who was the main conduit between North Korea and China. <U+201C>We can<U+2019>t play games with him,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said at the time, referring to Mr. Kim. <U+201C>Because he really does have missiles, and he really does have nukes.<U+201D> Such considerations <U+2014> and briefings that Mr. Trump presumably has received or will receive on the North<U+2019>s capabilities <U+2014> could compel the new president to prioritize security over trade in his dealings with China. With the right approach, he could find a willing partner in Beijing, said Yang Xiyu, a former Chinese official who oversaw the so-called six-party talks on the North<U+2019>s nuclear program that collapsed in 2008 . But Chinese officials say that approach would require removing a thorn in Beijing<U+2019>s side: an advanced missile defense system that the United States plans to install in South Korea. The Chinese view that system, known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System, as an effort to contain its ambitions in Asia, though Washington and Seoul say it is intended purely to defend South Korea against the North. In the past year, China has rebuffed many of Washington<U+2019>s requests for sharper measures against North Korea, and the missile system is one reason. Whether Mr. Trump would consider scrapping it is another unknown. Washington and Beijing did cooperate on United Nations sanctions against the North this year <U+2014> an encouraging sign, analysts said, though many doubt that economic punishment alone will be a deterrent. And on Friday, the Chinese state-run news media reported that Beijing would support a new round of sanctions being considered by the Security Council that would close loopholes allowing North Korea to sell coal. Mr. Yang, the former official, said the Trump administration must take into account Beijing<U+2019>s worst fear, where the North is concerned: a collapse of Mr. Kim<U+2019>s totalitarian regime, followed by refugees from the North pouring into China and a unified Korean Peninsula under the protection of the American military. As president, Mr. Trump must understand that Mr. Kim<U+2019>s government has to stay, Mr. Yang said. <U+201C>Remove the bombs, not the regime, is the key to a peaceful solution,<U+201D> Mr. Yang said. If the United States shares that goal, he said, <U+201C>we can cooperate sincerely and substantively.<U+201D> Yufan Huang contributed research.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all posted weekly gains that were smaller than those just after the election. The Dow industrials, for example, added 0.1% after the previous week<U+2019>s 5.4% rise was its best since 2011. The more-muted moves masked some sector shifts. <U+201C>The movement in the overall market really belies the turbulence that<U+2019>s been going on below the surface,<U+201D> said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at wealth manager BMO Private Bank. The blue-chip index slipped 35.89 points, or 0.2%, on Friday to 18867.93 as investors<U+2019> rush into industrial companies abated. Such firms helped boost the Dow industrials after Donald Trump<U+2019>s election sparked expectations of infrastructure spending. The S&P 500 slipped 5.22 points, or 0.2%, on Friday to 2181.90 but was up 0.8% over the week. Financials continued to rise, buoyed by bets on rising interest rates and loosened regulation after the election, adding 2.2% for the week. Through Friday<U+2019>s close, the S&P 500 was up 2% from the Nov. 8 election. Excluding financials, the S&P 500 would be up 0.6% in that period, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Health-care stocks, some of the best performers right after the election, pulled back. The sector was the biggest decliner of the week in the S&P 500, shedding 1.2%. Biotechnology companies had jumped as some investors expected drug-pricing restrictions would be less likely under Mr. Trump than they would have been under Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index rose 14% for the week ended Nov. 11, and followed that with a weekly loss of 1.1%. In the days immediately following Mr. Trump<U+2019>s win, shares of large technology companies tumbled and the performance gap between the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the Dow industrials widened. From the close on Nov. 8 through Nov. 14, Amazon.com <U+2019>s stock dropped 8.7%. In recent sessions, however, these companies<U+2019> shares have rebounded slightly. Amazon.com<U+2019>s stock closed the week up 2.9%. Tech stocks in the S&P 500 rose 1% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite posted a 1.6% weekly gain. Early Friday, the Nasdaq hit a new intraday high before pulling back. The index fell 12.46 points, or 0.2%, on Friday to 5321.51. Oil companies also were big gainers as crude prices rebounded. U.S. crude for December delivery increased 5.3% during the week to $45.69 a barrel, snapping a three-week losing streak , as hopes grew that major oil producers would reach agreement to cut output. In the week ended Nov. 16, financial, health-care, biotechnology and industrials sector funds all registered new weekly inflow records, as did U.S. equity funds, while emerging-market bond funds had their biggest-ever outflow, according to Cameron Brandt, global director of research at fund-tracker EPFR Global. <U+201C>Investors are just looking at what<U+2019>s in front of them today: The economy is improving, U.S. interest rates are going to be rising, and we<U+2019>ll get some infrastructure spending next year<U+2014>that<U+2019>s a very positive message in the short term,<U+201D> said Colin Graham, chief investment officer at BNP Paribas Investment Partners . Earnings reports swung some individual stocks Friday. Abercrombie & Fitch <U+2019>s stock fell $2.33, or 14%, to $14.60 after it posted its third consecutive quarter of declining same-store sales. Gap<U+2019>s stock declined 5.10, or 17%, to 25.61 as the apparel maker reported a drop in quarterly profit .

The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, was recently down 0.1% to 88.55. The British pound rose 0.5% to $1.2245 after Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney said he would remain in his post until 2019. Investors are watching economic data closely for signs that the U.S. economy is strong enough to handle an interest-rate increase this year. Data out Monday was mixed. A report showed that consumer spending rose a better-than-expected 0.5% in September, a sign of resilience among households amid steady job creation. Separately, a report measuring business activity in Chicago fell to a five-month low in October. The Federal Reserve will release its latest interest-rate decision at the close of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, but few expect the central bank to raise borrowing costs ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. <U+201C>The Fed will be closely watched given expectations that the Fed will signal its intent to hike rates in December,<U+201D> wrote analysts at TD Securities in a research note. <U+201C>We look for changes to the language that indicate <U+2018>further evidence<U+2019> of progress but do not expect an explicit discussion of a hike next month.<U+201D> Fed-funds futures, a popular tool for betting on central-bank policy, show that investors assign a 73% likelihood of a rate increase in December, according to CME Group data. Analysts say the next test for the dollar will be Friday<U+2019>s U.S. jobs report, which many see as the best read on the health of the U.S. labor market. The Japanese yen slipped ahead of the Bank of Japan <U+2019>s policy announcement, expected overnight. Expectations for further stimulus are muted. The dollar was up 0.1% to <U+00A5>104.8. The Mexican peso rebounded 0.6% against the dollar after data showed the Mexican economy expanded in the third quarter. The peso sold off sharply Friday after new evidence in the investigation of Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s emails cast uncertainty on the U.S. presidential election. The Mexican currency has been highly vulnerable to developments in the election as investors worry that Republican candidate Donald Trump <U+2019>s plans to build a wall between the two countries and to renegotiate trade agreements could damage Mexico<U+2019>s economy.

Ellie Mae Inc. <U+2019>s shares have gained 1,271% since an initial public offering in 2011, outpacing the likes of Tesla Motors Inc., Facebook Inc. and LinkedIn Corp. among U.S. listings. Its customers are the small mortgage lenders that have surged in the past five years thanks to low interest rates and big banks<U+2019> pullback from the housing market. But with the election victory of Donald Trump and a Republican sweep of both houses of Congress, that period may be coming to an end<U+2014>along with Ellie<U+2019>s days as a highflying stock. Mortgage rates have started rising , and investors are betting that big banks may soon be unshackled from some of the most onerous regulations and poised to recapture market share for mortgages. Ellie Mae<U+2019>s shares have dropped 23% since the election, while bank stocks and broader stock-market benchmarks have rallied. The Pleasanton, Calif., company was founded in 1997 by Sig Anderman and Limin Hu. It attracted investment from venture-capital funds and mortgage-industry giants including Fannie Mae. (Unlike other <U+201C>Mae<U+201D> firms, Ellie Mae has no relationship to the U.S. government. The name is a shortening of <U+201C>Electronic Mortgage Affiliates.<U+201D>) The company<U+2019>s software automates the mortgage process by helping a lender collect and compile appraisals, titles, income history and other documents. Customers pay monthly subscription fees of about $75 per user, plus additional fees for loans beyond a certain volume or other services and data. That software plus the resurgence of independent mortgage companies and a new boom in home lending, sparked by historically low rates, lifted Ellie Mae<U+2019>s business and stock. <U+201C>It was the perfect trifecta to drive growth,<U+201D> said Saket Kalia, an analyst at Barclays PLC. The stock is now reacting to the rise in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields since Election Day, Mr. Kalia said. <U+201C>One part of the story has arguably changed,<U+201D> he said. But he also cautioned that new home purchases weren<U+2019>t as rate sensitive as refinances. Like its customers, Ellie Mae was hit hard by the collapse of the housing market in 2008. Its founders slashed costs dramatically, but then filed to go public in 2010 as it sought to raise capital to expand a new software business focused on lenders, rather than brokers. At the time, few new investors were willing to bet much on a housing recovery. The IPO priced at $6 a share, despite aiming to sell for as much as $11. That left its initial market value below $150 million, requiring it to switch its listing from the New York Stock Exchange<U+2019>s big board to the junior market. Ellie Mae<U+2019>s shares started rising in 2012, allowing the company to move up to the NYSE big board. The company quickly gained dominance among the many small nonbank lenders. Ellie Mae<U+2019>s stock closed Friday at $82.26, and its market value now stands at $2.76 billion. Nonbank lenders account for more than half of all home loans , up from less than 10% in 2009, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. The majority of them are small players, which are more likely to outsource technology. Now, however, events may be moving against Ellie Mae, with rising rates depressing mortgage-refinancing volumes, and the potential loosening of some new rules that have forced many small firms to upgrade their processes. <U+201C>The election results are great for the old-line phone and fax originators,<U+201D> said Vishal Garg, founder of online mortgage firm Better Mortgage Inc. <U+201C>But it doesn<U+2019>t change the fact that [consumers] want something different from a mortgage company.<U+201D> Before the election, Ellie Mae had already been forecasting higher mortgage rates that could cut refinancing volume even as home purchases increased, said Chief Executive Jonathan Corr. Under looser regulations, Mr. Corr said, there would still be market pressure to adopt stringent lending guidelines that software is needed to manage. And banks might buy more mortgages from smaller lenders who are Ellie Mae customers rather than make more loans on their own. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re still going through a secular change to embracing automation,<U+201D> Mr. Corr said. <U+201C>We can still grow 25% a year for the foreseeable future.<U+201D> Write to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com",

Merkel previously blamed social media for anti-immigrant sentiment and the rise of the far right. \n<U+201C>The algorithms must be made public, so that one can inform oneself as an interested citizen on questions like: what influences my behavior on the internet and that of others?\" said Merkel during a media conference in Berlin on Tuesday. \n<U+201C>These algorithms, when they are not transparent, can lead to a distortion of our perception, they narrow our breadth of information.<U+201D> \nGoogle uses an algorithm to decide which search results are first shown to a user, while Facebook arranges the order of the news feed, and decides to include certain posts from a user<U+2019>s liked pages and friends, at the expense of others. Both sites also promote links to news articles, often based on a user<U+2019>s own media interests. Read more Germany orders Facebook to stop collecting data on WhatsApp users \nThese algorithms are at the core of the intellectual property of any social media or search website, and comprise some of the most highly-protected trade secrets in the world, potentially worth billions. No internet giant has ever revealed its inner workings. \nMerkel did not specifically name Facebook, Google or Twitter, but implied that the large platforms are creating <U+201C>bubbles<U+201D> of self-reinforcing views, and squeezing out smaller news providers. \n\"The big internet platforms, via their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle which diverse media must pass through to reach users,<U+201D> warned Merkel. <U+201C>This is a development that we need to pay careful attention to.<U+201D> \nThe internet giants themselves have argued that the so-called social media bubble is largely a myth, and that online users have a wider access to differing views than under a pre-internet model, where most news would be acquired from just a handful of newspapers and one or two TV channels.

The only answer now is to take on the billionaires\nBy Naomi Klein\nNovember 10, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" The Guardian \" - They will blame James Comey and the FBI. They will blame voter suppression and racism. They will blame Bernie or bust and misogyny. They will blame third parties and independent candidates. They will blame the corporate media for giving him the platform, social media for being a bullhorn, and WikiLeaks for airing the laundry.\nBut this leaves out the force most responsible for creating the nightmare in which we now find ourselves wide awake: neoliberalism. That worldview <U+0096> fully embodied by Hillary Clinton and her machine <U+0096> is no match for Trump-style extremism. The decision to run one against the other is what sealed our fate. If we learn nothing else, can we please learn from that mistake?\nHere is what we need to understand: a hell of a lot of people are in pain. Under neoliberal policies of deregulation, privatisation, austerity and corporate trade, their living standards have declined precipitously. They have lost jobs. They have lost pensions. They have lost much of the safety net that used to make these losses less frightening. They see a future for their kids even worse than their precarious present.\nAt the same time, they have witnessed the rise of the Davos class, a hyper-connected network of banking and tech billionaires, elected leaders who are awfully cosy with those interests, and Hollywood celebrities who make the whole thing seem unbearably glamorous. Success is a party to which they were not invited, and they know in their hearts that this rising wealth and power is somehow directly connected to their growing debts and powerlessness.\nFor the people who saw security and status as their birthright <U+0096> and that means white men most of all <U+0096> these losses are unbearable.\nDonald Trump speaks directly to that pain. The Brexit campaign spoke to that pain. So do all of the rising far-right parties in Europe. They answer it with nostalgic nationalism and anger at remote economic bureaucracies <U+0096> whether Washington, the North American free trade agreement the World Trade Organisation or the EU. And of course, they answer it by bashing immigrants and people of colour, vilifying Muslims, and degrading women. Elite neoliberalism has nothing to offer that pain, because neoliberalism unleashed the Davos class. People such as Hillary and Bill Clinton are the toast of the Davos party. In truth, they threw the party.\nTrump<U+0092>s message was: <U+0093>All is hell.<U+0094> Clinton answered: <U+0093>All is well.<U+0094> But it<U+0092>s not well <U+0096> far from it.\nNeo-fascist responses to rampant insecurity and inequality are not going to go away. But what we know from the 1930s is that what it takes to do battle with fascism is a real left. A good chunk of Trump<U+0092>s support could be peeled away if there were a genuine redistributive agenda on the table. An agenda to take on the billionaire class with more than rhetoric, and use the money for a green new deal. Such a plan could create a tidal wave of well-paying unionised jobs, bring badly needed resources and opportunities to communities of colour, and insist that polluters should pay for workers to be retrained and fully included in this future. It could fashion policies that fight institutionalised racism, economic inequality and climate change at the same time. It could take on bad trade deals and police violence, and honour indigenous people as the original protectors of the land, water and air.\nPeople have a right to be angry, and a powerful, intersectional left agenda can direct that anger where it belongs, while fighting for holistic solutions that will bring a frayed society together.\nSuch a coalition is possible. In Canada, we have begun to cobble it together under the banner of a people<U+0092>s agenda called The Leap Manifesto , endorsed by more than 220 organisations from Greenpeace Canada to Black Lives Matter Toronto, and some of our largest trade unions.\nBernie Sanders<U+0092> amazing campaign went a long way towards building this sort of coalition, and demonstrated that the appetite for democratic socialism is out there. But early on, there was a failure in the campaign to connect with older black and Latino voters who are the demographic most abused by our current economic model. That failure prevented the campaign from reaching its full potential. Those mistakes can be corrected and a bold, transformative coalition is there to be built on.\nThat is the task ahead. The Democratic party needs to be either decisively wrested from pro-corporate neoliberals, or it needs to be abandoned. From Elizabeth Warren to Nina Turner, to the Occupy alumni who took the Bernie campaign supernova, there is a stronger field of coalition-inspiring progressive leaders out there than at any point in my lifetime. We are <U+0093>leaderful<U+0094>, as many in the Movement for Black Lives say.\nSo let<U+0092>s get out of shock as fast as we can and build the kind of radical movement that has a genuine answer to the hate and fear represented by the Trumps of this world. Let<U+0092>s set aside whatever is keeping us apart and start right now.\nNaomi Klein is the author of This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs the Climate . She tweets @NaomiAKlein",

The news puts Moskowitz in the company of other education reform leaders like former D.C. public schools chief Michelle Rhee and Center for Education Reform director Jeanne Allen, among others. Story Continued Below A spokeswoman for Success declined to comment on whether Moskowitz was considering the position. The very fact that Moskowitz isn't shooting down the rumors could have political implications for the longtime Democrat, who has long had ambitions of running for mayor of New York City. Moskowitz lives in Manhattan (where Hillary Clinton drew approximately 90 percent of the vote against Trump) and represented the Upper East Side as a Democratic City Councilwoman. She started her network of 41 schools in Harlem in 2006. Sources close to Moskowitz maintain that she is still interested in running for mayor at some point, even though she announced last year that she would not challenge Mayor Bill de Blasio in the 2017 race. Her political power in New York has already been tested over the last year, following a spate of negative press about her schools' discipline practices and internal workings, a federal investigation conducted by the Office of Civil Rights, and mounting criticism from local elected officials. It is unclear whether Moskowitz could be confirmed as a cabinet official of an agency that is investigating her schools. After scoring a number of clean political wins over the de Blasio administration early in the mayor's term, Moskowitz and her pro-charter allies at Families for Excellent Schools have more recently absorbed a series of setbacks, from an attempt to re-negotiate a pre-Kindergarten contract to an ongoing but little-noticed dispute over school space for Success middle schoolers. Moskowitz continued her fight with City Hall over school space this week, even as her name was being floated on national television for education secretary. Moskowitz will appear at a press conference on the steps of City Hall on Thursday to call on de Blasio to create \"permanent school space\" for some Success middle school students. While Moskowitz has found herself on the defensive at home, Success is still seen as a national charter model by many influential reform leaders. That's based in large part on loyal, vocal support for her from the families of her student body, which is overwhelmingly poor, black and Latino <U+2014> groups among whom opposition to Trump in the election was particularly strong. (Success staff seemed to be mourning the results last week; the network's social media staff posted a Langston Hughes poem about equality in America on its Twitter feed the morning after the election.) Politics aside, Moskowitz might chafe at the constraints of the post, which is viewed among education observers largely as a bureaucratic position without all the power the title would suggest. This would be particularly true if a Trump administration set about relinquishing some federal power back to the states. And while Trump has pledged to \"get rid of\" the Common Core, Moskowitz is a strong supporter of the set of standards introduced by President Obama. An enormous part of her schools' renown is Success students' high scores on Common Core-aligned exams. Hedge fund manager John Paulson, a major Trump ally, is also a supporter of Moskowitz, having given Success an $8.5 million donation last year. Paulson, who has also given to de Blasio's computer science initiative, is one of Trump's most prominent supporters in the finance world. But the federal position would provide Moskowitz a powerful new perch commensurate with the size of her professional ambitions. She has made no secret of her ultimate ambition to overhaul New York's public school system by significantly expanding the size of the charter sector and making charters a legitimate competitor to district schools. She's said she wants to expand her own network to 100 schools over the next decade. As education secretary, she could help ensure the enormous growth of charters not only in New York but around the country.

(Screen shot via PBS ) \nLast Wednesday, author and Truthdig contributor Chris Hedges joined Tavis Smiley on Smiley<U+2019>s PBS talk show for a conversation about the current election, the impending threat of neoliberalism and the need for popular progressive movements. \nFirst, Hedges discussed the two main-party candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Hedges said that Trump is <U+201C>a man with very little self-control, not much intellectual depth, no real policy experience,<U+201D> and noted that Clinton is <U+201C>a creature of the establishment.<U+201D> \nHe continued: \nShe<U+2019>s emblematic of what, again, across the political spectrum, people have risen up against. \nAnd, therefore, she<U+2019>s a very weak and a very dangerous political figure because as this assault continues on the poor, on working men and women, the shrinking middle class, she will become a lightning rod for this discontent.. \nSmiley asked Hedges, <U+201C>So your neoliberal criticism notwithstanding, if she wins with what she interprets as a mandate and you don<U+2019>t think she<U+2019>s qualified to deal with these issues, what say you about how we at least go about holding her accountable?<U+201D> \n<U+201C>We have to build popular movements to push back,<U+201D> Hedges declared, <U+201C>because the system itself is not going to respond.<U+201D> \nThe conversation then turned to political representations of popular resistance. Smiley brought up the massive wave of support behind Bernie Sanders<U+2019> presidential campaign, and asked, <U+201C>What happens to those Bernie supporters who can<U+2019>t make the turn on November 8?<U+201D> \n<U+201C>I am supporting the Green Party,<U+201D> Hedges replied, <U+201C>not because I think they can win, but because I look at Syriza, which is now the ruling party of Greece. Ten years ago, they were polling at four percent. I look at groups like Podemos in Spain. I think we have to build not only alternative movements, but alternative forms of political power to represent our interest.<U+201D> \nSmiley and Hedges began to wrap up by discussing WikiLeaks and mainstream-media accountability. <U+201C>What I have not seen as yet is a robust conversation about how we process what we read from WikiLeaks,<U+201D> Smiley said. <U+201C>Is Secretary Clinton right essentially that we ought to dismiss this and focus on the issue of who is hacking our emails and what it means if a foreign government is doing that?<U+201D> \nHedges responded: \nWell, I worked for many decades as a newspaper reporter, including 15 for The New York Times, and I was leaked all sorts of material by the U.S. government, by the French Intelligence Agency, even by the Israeli Mossad. And my job as a reporter was to determine whether the information that I had been leaked was true or untrue and then run it [or not]. \nNow people who leaked me this stuff were not leaking it because they love democracy or an open society. They were leaking it because it was in their interest to leak it. And whoever leaked this to WikiLeaks or wherever they got it, I don<U+2019>t know, but that<U+2019>s not the question. \nThe question is, is this true? And it is a look at the inner workings of power, but I think you<U+2019>re right. I think that much of the media has diverted attention from the content of the emails to speculate<U+2014>and it does appear to be speculation<U+2014>that this is an attempt by Russia to interfere in our elections. \nFinally, Smiley asked Hedges about the role of the media in the current election. Hedges argued that it was <U+201C>deeply irresponsible<U+201D> for mainstream media to rely on Trump<U+2019>s personality to bring in viewers and higher ratings. \n<U+201C>Actual discussion of content, of issues that matter to Americans, is very, very rarely heard in the press<U+2026>.The press has failed us on many levels,<U+201D> Hedges said. \nYou can watch the entire interview here .",

The FEC complaints center on some of the growing number of Democratic TV ads linking Republican House candidates to Donald Trump. It<U+2019>s a potentially devastating line of attack given Trump<U+2019>s unpopularity, and the DCCC has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in coordination with some candidates to help them air the ads <U+2014> well in excess of the normal $48,100 limit on coordinated expenditures in most House races. Story Continued Below Some candidates have legally exceeded the party-coordination limits in recent elections by making carefully worded <U+201C> hybrid <U+201D> ads, which justify the unlimited cost splitting by making generic references to the parties as well as mentioning local candidates. But the DCCC is sharing massive campaign costs on ads directly naming a presidential candidate as well as local House candidates, which have prompted a series of FEC complaints from the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust. <U+201C>This is a clear violation,<U+201D> said FACT executive director Matt Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney in the George W. Bush administration. The DCCC declined to comment on its ad strategy. A spokeswoman said FACT is trying to prevent Democrats from linking Trump and down-ballot candidates. <U+201C>Knowing full well the damage Donald Trump is causing to their poll numbers, House Republicans are desperately grasping at any opportunity to hide their support for him and his dangerous agenda <U+2014> even resorting to frivolous complaints and meritless legal action,<U+201D> DCCC spokeswoman Meredith Kelly said in a statement. <U+201C>Sadly for them, it<U+2019>s too late to paper over their long and steady support for the unfit and unhinged Donald Trump.<U+201D> Many of the Democratic candidates hit with complaints have aired traditional hybrid ads with the DCCC as well as ads that mention Trump. <U+201C>Darrell Issa and the tea party Republicans tried to play politics with our lives,<U+201D> says a 9/11 first responder in a hybrid ad from Doug Applegate, the Democrat challenging GOP Rep. Darrell Issa in California. But Applegate has also aired two ads which link Issa to Trump. They were paid for jointly by Applegate and the DCCC, which have together spent nearly $1 million on TV ads, according to a source tracking ad buys. Some but not nearly all of that spending could be on regular coordinated ads, which can have unrestricted content <U+2014> but do have restrictions on total spending by the DCCC. The spending has been a big help to Applegate, who like many other Democratic House challengers burst onto the scene relatively late this year and faces a well-funded opponent. <U+201C>Just like Trump, Issa gamed the system to line his own pockets,<U+201D> one ad <U+2019>s narrator says. In the other spot , Trump<U+2019>s lewd 2005 comments about grabbing women without consent play as a narrator says, <U+201C>Darrell Issa says Donald Trump is the obvious choice for president. ... It<U+2019>s time to put country first. Say no to Donald Trump and Darrell Issa.<U+201D> FACT<U+2019>s complaint against Applegate argues that his ads naming Trump are not hybrid ads, and that there is thus no legal justification for cost-sharing on them beyond the normal limits without the traditional generic mention of the other party. <U+201C>The generic reference to candidates ... is crucial to the concept of hybrid advertisements: that portion of the advertisement is attributable to the party committee solely because the political party derives proportional benefit from the advertisement<U+2019>s generic party references,<U+201D> FACT<U+2019>s complaint against Applegate reads. <U+201C>Without generic party references, the political party committee derives no benefit from its portion of the advertisement, and the costs of the political party<U+2019>s portion must be paid for as a coordinated party expenditure or classified as an in-kind contribution to the clearly identified candidate.<U+201D> FACT, which has filed FEC complaints against other several other Democratic groups in the last two years, issued similar complaints against the DCCC and 11 other Democratic House challengers: Bryan Caforio and Michael Eggman of California, Morgan Carroll of Colorado, Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Jim Mowrer of Iowa, Suzanna Shkreli of Michigan, Ruben Kihuen of Nevada, Colleen Deacon of New York, Steve Santarsiero of Pennsylvania, Pete Gallego of Texas, and Tom Nelson of Wisconsin. The complaints also name Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s campaign (because, they argue, she is the beneficiary of ads attacking Trump). Campaign law experts have been puzzled by the slew of Trump-focused Democratic ads which <U+2014> as FACT points out <U+2014> are not traditional hybrid ads but which are paid for similarly, according to their end-of-ad disclaimers. <U+201C>These raise very tricky questions<U+201D> about the legal justification for the cost-splitting, said Larry Noble, a former FEC general counsel now at the Campaign Legal Center. <U+201C>It shows how parties are constantly looking for new ways to get around various limits, in this case the coordinated expenditure limit.<U+201D> Though the DCCC has declined to discuss its ad strategy, a Democratic source had previously told POLITICO that <U+201C>the legal logic is that it<U+2019>s half an issue ad paid for by the DCCC and half a candidate ad paid for by the candidate.<U+201D> <U+201C>If they were to say it<U+2019>s half an ad about Donald Trump, arguably ... they might argue it<U+2019>s an electioneering communication or a regular campaign ad against Trump,<U+201D> Noble continued, referring to types of political ads that mention or attack candidates on policy grounds or expressly advocate their election or defeat. The DCCC<U+2019>s independent expenditure reports do include numerous media expenses against Trump, who has been a theme in the committee<U+2019>s standalone, independent advertising as well as Democratic candidate advertising. Among the millions of dollars in the DCCC<U+2019>s independent expenditure filings are over $150,000 in payments to The New Media Firm, Applegate<U+2019>s media consultants, for media buys and production expenses opposing Trump <U+2014> though the reports do not indicate the district in which the money was spent. The National Republican Congressional Committee said House Democrats are using the FEC<U+2019>s tendency to deadlock on tough issues as a shield to spend extra money with candidates in the 2016 elections. <U+201C>Democrats are banking on the fact that the FEC<U+2019>s three Democratic commissioners will force a deadlock and save the Clinton campaign and the DCCC from any enforcement action,<U+201D> NRCC spokeswoman Katie Martin said in a statement.

Republican President George W. Bush and Democratic President Barack Obama or their senior aides held regular news conferences during their transitions, often daily briefings updating their progress in building the new White House team. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s video included six calls for action on trade , immigration , energy, regulatory curbs, national security and ethics changes, most of which have already been announced either during the campaign or the transition period. He didn<U+2019>t mention action on the Affordable Care Act, his proposed wall along the southern border, the tax code or the Iran nuclear deal, all of which were central arguments for his election. Several of the changes would direct government agencies or officials to come up with new plans for how to operate, and their impact could take some time to be felt. For example, he will order military leaders to develop a plan to deal with cyberattacks and other threats, a review that could become broad in scope. He said he will also initiate an investigation into visa fraud, and impose a new rule to limit future regulations. The pledge that could make a difference quickly is one to <U+201C>cancel job-killing restrictions on the production of American energy, including shale energy and clean coal.<U+201D> He said this would create <U+201C>many millions of high-paying jobs.<U+201D> Capital Journal is WSJ.com<U+2019>s home for Trump transition news.

Mary Fallin, who is considered a candidate for the Interior Department. Ms. Fallin told reporters she wasn<U+2019>t offered a job in the meeting. <U+201C>We discussed a wide range of issues<U+201D> she said. Mr. Trump also met with a liberal Democrat, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders during her party<U+2019>s presidential primary. The congresswoman and the president-elect discussed some areas of agreement, including their shared opposition to the war in Syria and focusing resources on rebuilding the country, according to a statement by Ms. Gabbard. The parade of visitors to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s New York offices provided a sense of energy around the transition efforts, even though no major appointments have been unveiled for days. Yet there are some risks to the high-profile nature of the meetings. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a potential contender for Homeland Security secretary , left a meeting with Mr. Trump on Sunday with what appeared to be his multipoint strategic plan for the Department of Homeland Security that called for <U+201C>extreme vetting questions for high-risk aliens,<U+201D> according to photos of the document captured as he exited the president-elect<U+2019>s Bedminster, N.J., golf club. The Topeka (Kan.) Capital-Journal reported on the document earlier Monday. The document Mr. Kobach held was only partially visible as some of it was obscured by his hand. The header for the document was <U+201C>DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY<U+2014>KOBACH STRATEGIC PLAN FOR FIRST 365 DAYS.<U+201D> The vetting questions included things such as their support for <U+201C>Sharia law, jihad, equality of men and women, [and] the United States Constitution.<U+201D> A representative for Mr. Kobach<U+2019>s office didn<U+2019>t return a message seeking comment. Spokesmen for the Trump transition team didn<U+2019>t respond to requests for comment. Write to Michael C. Bender at Mike.Bender@wsj.com and Damian Paletta at damian.paletta@wsj.com",

Kelly Ayotte said of her decision to disavow Donald Trump.  | Getty While other GOP lawmakers waver or flip-flop, the New Hampshire Republican is done with Trump. By Burgess Everett 10/13/16 05:09 AM EDT MANCHESTER, N.H. <U+2014> Just minutes after news broke of women alleging that Donald Trump had touched them inappropriately, Kelly Ayotte realized the benefit of withdrawing her endorsement of the Republican presidential candidate. She no longer has to defend the guy. Story Continued Below <U+201C>What comes out about him, I think I<U+2019>ve already said my piece on it,<U+201D> Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican, said on Wednesday after attending a fallen police officer ceremony here in the state<U+2019>s largest city. For the first-term senator, her decision to disavow Trump after he was caught bragging about making unwanted sexual advances with women is not without political risk. Standing up to Trump will help burnish her independent credentials, but Republicans are worried that her reversal on Trump will depress turnout among his core supporters. Clearly, that's a worry for enough of Ayotte's GOP colleagues that they took back their un-endorsements on Wednesday, after calling for their nominee to resign over the weekend. But Ayotte says she<U+2019>s willing to lose her race in order to repudiate a Republican standard bearer who has bragged about unwanted sexual advances on women and was accused in a Wednesday New York Times report of touching women without their consent. By Rachael Bade and Heather Caygle <U+201C>I made the decision I made as a matter of principle,<U+201D> said Ayotte, who had spent months criticizing Trump while maintaining she preferred him over Hillary Clinton. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s more important to me than winning an election.<U+201D> Still, GOP officials in New Hampshire and Washington are worried that Ayotte will be dragged down by Trump's spiral of scandal and controversy. They're bracing for polling that could show Ayotte<U+2019>s slim lead evaporating <U+2014> or worse. A Public Policy Polling survey that took into account some of the fallout over Trump, as well as Ayotte<U+2019>s rescinded endorsement, showed her opponent <U+2014> Gov. Maggie Hassan (D) <U+2014> up just one point, suggesting that she's not suffering political consequences, at least not yet. Earlier Wednesday, a few miles down the road in her hometown of Nashua, two voters <U+2014> one a Democrat, one a Republican <U+2014> offered a window into the embattled senator's best chance for holding onto her seat in one of the most important Senate races in the country. Despite hailing from opposite ends of the political spectrum, both plan on voting for Ayotte even after her surprise decision on Saturday to retract her endorsement of Trump. <U+201C>I certainly am supporting Kelly. And I<U+2019>m a Democrat. She<U+2019>s really a shining star in the Senate,<U+201D> said Stanley Stoncius, who opposes Trump and may have to <U+201C>hold my nose<U+201D> for Hillary Clinton. <U+201C>She<U+2019>s the state senator. She<U+2019>s not representing Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.\" By Cristiano Lima <U+201C>I want to keep the Senate to stay the way it is. I don<U+2019>t want the communists to take over,<U+201D> said Trump supporter Jacques Cattiaux. Her decision to not endorse Trump <U+201C>was calculating,<U+201D> he admitted. <U+201C>But that<U+2019>s the filth of politics.<U+201D> For Ayotte, a first-term New Hampshire Republican senator, to defeat Hassan next month, the Republican will need a blend of thousands of voters just like Stoncius and Cattiaux going to the ballot box in a race that<U+2019>s been deadlocked for a year and half. Democrats are in the field conducting internal polls this week to measure the fallout of Trump <U+2014> and some senior staffers believe the state is now a surefire win for Democrats with Trump<U+2019>s implosion. But Hassan is making a counterintuitive argument: That Ayotte made her about-face after sheepishly standing by Trump for months because it will earn her political points in a state that favors independence. <U+201C>She finally decided that that was enough and what I would ask her is: Why now? And I think the answer is very clear that this is a political calculation on her part. She<U+2019>s trying to walk back her support because she understands it could cost her politically,<U+201D> Hassan said. By Madeline Conway The disciplined governor, who is among the most careful politicians running for the Senate this year, is going all-in behind a strategy to portray Ayotte as <U+201C>Craven Kelly,<U+201D> as her press team puts it, a politician so calculating that she stuck with Trump through fights with beauty queens and federal judges only until the winds shifted the other way. <U+201C>The question becomes: Whether she was surprised by it, which really calls into question her judgment. Or whether for most of the last year when she supported Donald Trump she was doing that because she had to politically and now she realizes that for political purposes, that will cost her,<U+201D> Hassan said after touring the W.H. Bagshaw pin-making plant in Nashua owned by Democratic supporters. Republicans say that<U+2019>s not the case. They don<U+2019>t know yet whether Ayotte hurt or helped herself on Saturday with her Trump withdrawal <U+2014> and they say Ayotte doesn<U+2019>t know yet either. <U+201C>This is a personal decision for Ayotte, not a political decision,<U+201D> said a GOP operative on the ground here. <U+201C>The Democrats would love to make this a referendum on the top of the ticket.<U+201D> Neither Hassan or Ayotte said they knew what effect her decision to abandon Trump will have on this tightly locked Senate race, despite bullish projections from Washington Democrats. But as her colleagues John Thune of South Dakota and Deb Fischer of Nebraska said Wednesday they would vote for Trump even after calling on him to step down as the nominee, it was clear that the Republican has no second thoughts. <U+201C>I met a woman in the frozen food aisle in Market Basket and she gave gave me a big hug,<U+201D> Ayotte said, recounting the days after she distanced herself from Trump. <U+201C>She had that reaction. But people certainly have different perspectives on it.<U+201D> By Thomas Wright By Bill Scher By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Jonathan Cook \n source: informationclearinghouse.info \n text: Guardian Plays Robin to MI5<U+0092>s Batman By Jonathan Cook\n Today the Guardian offers decisive confirmation that it is only too willing to serve as an establishment mouthpiece. It proudly announces that it is the venue selected by Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, Britain<U+0092>s FBI, to receive the agency<U+0092>s first-ever newspaper interview.\nIf the Guardian were a proper independent newspaper, it would regard this interview as a stain. Instead it bills it as a front-page <U+0093>exclusive<U+0094>. Exclusively, the Guardian has been given the chance to regurgitate MI5<U+0092>s propaganda <U+0096> propaganda designed to help stoke a new Cold War with Russia.\nIn fact, this is not an <U+0093>interview<U+0094> as the Guardian claims, for the simple reason that the paper<U+0092>s two <U+0093>interviewers<U+0094> <U+0096> one of them its deputy editor, Paul Johnson <U+0096> have no basis on which to question the quality of the <U+0093>classified<U+0094> information they are being fed.\nEverything Parker tells them could have been guessed at without the interview:\nthe Russians under Vladimir Putin are an evil empire; Islamic jihadists are everywhere but MI5 is brilliant at foiling their terror attacks; the increased budget MI5 has received is entirely justified because it is doing such a brilliant job of foiling terror attacks; MI5<U+0092>s extra powers to surveil us all are necessary to foil those terror attacks; whatever happens with Brexit, MI5 will continue doing a brilliant job protecting the British people; MI5 is determined to become a friendlier place for women and minority ethnic applicants. This isn<U+0092>t journalism, it<U+0092>s the very definition of stenography.\nEven the Guardian seems to sense that its readers might wonder why this interview is being published in their newspaper. But rather than discuss why the Guardian would want to publish an interview with Parker, the paper asks the opposite question: why has MI5 chosen the Guardian? This is framed in a way to make it look as though Parker has entered a combative environment in coming to the Guardian. The paper reminds us that it broke the Edward Snowden story.\nIn fact, the Guardian<U+0092>s Snowden revelations seem like another era. Remember that the Guardian got access to Snowden<U+0092>s documents only via their star columnist Glenn Greenwald, who has since departed after what appeared to be an increasingly troubled relationship, especially after the Snowden revelations. Instead Parker is once again given an opportunity to attack Snowden, accentuating the <U+0093>damage that was done to the work of British and allied intelligence agencies<U+0094> by Snowden<U+0092>s efforts to bring to public attention the systematic and secretive invasions of our privacy.\nThe Guardian is in far more comfortable territory playing Robin to MI5<U+0092>s Batman.\nSo why has Parker selected the Guardian rather than, say, the more obviously establishment London Times?\nBecause the Guardian<U+0092>s articles are not behind a paywall and so are easily accessible to anyone online? Because it has become the preferred British news source for American elites, whose own media are even more servile to power? Because the Guardian<U+0092>s (unjustified) reputation for leftwing and critical journalism will bestow on this MI5 press release the necessary pretence that Parker has been subjected to tough questioning from the Guardian? Or because Parker knew that the Guardian would be as docilely accepting of his propaganda as any rightwing outlet of the corporate media?\nDraw your own conclusions.\nJonathan Cook is a Nazareth- based journalist and winner of the Martha Gellhorn Special Prize for Journalism",

Richard Burr (R., N.C.) has won his bid for re-election, defeating lawyer and former state legislator Deborah Ross in a race that was surprisingly close and illustrated the changing politics and demographics of North Carolina. The two-term incumbent retained his seat with 51% of the vote, compared with Ms. Ross<U+2019>s 45.6%, with 72% of precincts reporting when the Associated Press called the race. The close margin reflected the degree to which Mr. Burr, 60 years old, had to fight back against an unexpectedly strong challenge from Ms. Ross, 53, who wasn<U+2019>t even her party<U+2019>s first choice for the seat. He did it with prodigious fundraising and careful positioning of his candidacy in relation to his party<U+2019>s presidential candidate, Donald Trump. He supported Mr. Trump but kept his distance from the celebrity businessman on the campaign trail. Mr. Burr, a policy-oriented chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said during the campaign that he wasn<U+2019>t <U+201C>on anyone<U+2019>s coattails,<U+201D> despite efforts by Ms. Ross to connect the two. Mr. Burr, who served 10 years in the House before winning his Senate seat in 2004, won re-election handily in 2010. Some Republicans were concerned that he waited until August to begin running ads in a state that became a battleground at all levels in 2016. But Mr. Burr has built a reputation for constituent service, and he made the case that Ms. Ross, a former state legislator and former head of the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, was too liberal for North Carolina. The Republican Party has been dominant in North Carolina for years, but its political landscape has been changing with an influx of new voters brought in with the expansion of banking and other industries in the state, making it one of the most closely divided battlegrounds in the nation.",

A series of standoffs resulted in <U+201C>protectors<U+201D> being maced, shot with rubber bullets, tasered, and even attacked with sound and concussion cannons. Ultimately, 117 people were arrested in the plight to stop the four-state Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) from being constructed.\nAfter months of similar struggle to protect sacred burial grounds and the Missouri river, opposers of the DAPL were blessed today when a herd of buffalo appeared from nowhere. While mass arrests, macing, and beatings from batons took place, a stampede of bison appeared near the Standing Rock protest camp. Reportedly, a cry of joy erupted from the crowd, as protectors have been praying for help from the American bison (known as Tatanka Oyate) during their standoff with riot police and national guardsmen.\nAs UsUncut relays , the Native American culture honors the Tatanka Oyate as a symbol of sacrifice. Its appearance is reportedly being hailed as a gift from the Great Spirit.\nDespite impressive attention being given to the protesting of the Dakota Access Pipeline by alternative media sites , activists on the frontlines, and even celebrities such as Mark Ruffalo and Shailene Woodley , little is being done in Washington D.C. The tribal leaders are calling on state and federal governments to respect the constitutional rights of water protectors and to stop the mistreatment of the indigenous who assert their ownership of the land due to a 1881 treaty.",

More than 80% of white evangelical and born-again Christians voted for Mr. Trump, according to national exit polling<U+2014>a larger percentage than backed Mitt Romney, John McCain or George W. Bush, the GOP candidates in the past three elections. Though evangelicals have voted overwhelmingly for Republicans for decades, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s nomination sparked an identity crisis among conservative Christians , which some feared might even split up the religious right<U+2019>s powerful political voting bloc. Evangelical leaders sparred on television over whether Christians could back the GOP nominee. Many openly questioned his character, which evangelicals had had long stressed as important for elected officials. Evangelical women began denouncing him on social media after the Access Hollywood video, which showed Mr. Trump bragging about groping women, was released. (Allegations of sexual assault followed, all of which Mr. Trump denied.) But ultimately, white religious conservatives showed up for Mr. Trump<U+00A0>on Tuesday<U+00A0>in force. Despite misgivings about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s character, more than 75% of white evangelical women voted for him, according to the exit polls. <U+201C>It isn<U+2019>t that folks liked him more than previous candidates,<U+201D> Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council and a Trump supporter, wrote on Twitter Tuesday<U+00A0>night as vote tallies came in. <U+201C>They were mobilized by what<U+2019>s at stake & the clear contrast w/Hillary on life.<U+201D> For conservative Christian critics of Mr. Trump, his victory only underscored the questions about what the religious right now stands for. Russell Moore, the public face of the Southern Baptist Convention and one of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s most persistent critics, posted an essay online early Wednesday<U+00A0>morning in which he said the election had left evangelical Christians <U+201C>politically homeless.<U+201D> <U+201C>The sort of conservatism that many of us had hoped for<U+2014>a multiethnic, constitutionally-anchored, forward-looking conservatism<U+2014>has been replaced in the Republican Party by something else,<U+201D> Dr. Moore wrote.<U+00A0><U+201C>The most important lesson we should learn is that the church must stand against the way politics has become a religion, and religion has become politics.<U+201D> In some cases, the overwhelming conservative religious support for Mr. Trump helped push vital states into the Republican column. In Florida, where white evangelical and born-again Christians made up a fifth of the electorate, 85% backed Mr. Trump, according to ABC exit polling. Mormons largely stood by Mr. Trump, following polls over the last month suggesting that their reluctance to support him could make Utah a toss-up. In the end, he carried Utah comfortably . Mr. Trump also won a majority of the white Catholic vote. Nonwhite conservative Christians did reject Mr. Trump: 72% of nonwhite evangelical and born-again Christians voted for Mrs. Clinton, according to exit polls, roughly the same percentage as the total of nonwhite voters who supported her. But at 26% of the nationwide electorate, white evangelicals demonstrated clearly<U+00A0>on Tuesday<U+00A0>that they remain a powerful<U+2014>and overwhelmingly Republican<U+2014>voting bloc. <U+201C>Far more than what divides us, this election has revealed what unites us,<U+201D> said Paula White, a pastor at the<U+00A0>New Destiny Christian Center and a steadfast supporter of Mr. Trump. <U+201C>I have never seen such solidarity between evangelicals and Catholics, Pentecostals, Charismatics and Baptists.<U+201D> Write to Ian Lovett at Ian.Lovett@wsj.com",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Kristina Peterson \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-leaders-grapple-with-details-of-fulfilling-trumps-campaign-pledges-1479150660 \n text: WASHINGTON<U+2014>GOP leaders on Monday struggled to articulate in detail how they would implement President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s campaign pledges on Capitol Hill and whether they approved of the president-elect<U+2019>s first staffing picks for his administration. The prospects of complete GOP control across the White House and both chambers of Congress thrilled Republicans last week. But its ramifications began to set in over the weekend and Monday. A particularly contentious topic was Mr. Trump<U+2019>s decision to name Stephen Bannon , the former head of Breitbart News, as chief strategist. That appointment provided an early measure of the challenges GOP leaders will face over the next four years responding to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s most unorthodox decisions. In a briefing with reporters that turned combative, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) repeatedly declined to comment directly on the qualifications of Mr. Bannon, whom Mr. Trump said Sunday would be his chief strategist and senior counsel. Mr. Bannon became chairman of the Trump campaign in late summer, leaving his position atop Breitbart News. That website has taken aim at establishment GOP figures and is identified with the <U+201C>alt-right,<U+201D> a movement that promotes nativism and views immigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity. <U+201C>The president has a right to select the team<U+201D> he wants to work with in the White House, Mr. McCarthy said. While he praised Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, whom Mr. Trump named as his chief of staff, Mr. McCarthy said he didn't know Mr. Bannon well enough and would give him <U+201C>the benefit of the doubt.<U+201D> Mr. McCarthy said he spoke briefly with Mr. Bannon on Sunday. Mr. McCarthy questioned whether Mr. Bannon was responsible for a series of inflammatory Breitbart headlines widely seen as critical of women, immigrants and Jews. When asked how he would respond to illegal immigrants<U+2019> fears of deportation and worries of violence against Muslims and other minorities, Mr. McCarthy spoke about the symbolism of a painting in his office featuring Americans of different ethnicities. <U+201C>I know people are trying to create all this fear,<U+201D> Mr. McCarthy said. The only Breitbart headline he directly criticized was one that called former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona the <U+201C>gun control movement<U+2019>s human shield.<U+201D> In January 2011, Ms. Giffords was shot in the head in a shooting spree outside a Safeway supermarket in Tucson. <U+201C>Nowhere would I ever agree with those words,<U+201D> Mr. McCarthy said. Democrats have sharply criticized Mr. Trump<U+2019>s selection of Mr. Bannon in a high-profile role in his administration . Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence committee, said that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s choice was <U+201C>unsurprising but alarming<U+201D> in a message on Twitter late Sunday. <U+201C>His alt-right, anti-Semitic and misogynistic views don<U+2019>t belong in the White House.<U+201D> Mr. McCarthy also declined to go into details on how the House might implement Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign pledges to build a wall along the southern border with Mexico, deport illegal immigrants and repeal and replace the 2010 health-care law. When asked about building a wall, Mr. McCarthy said he expected lawmakers would focus on boosting border security, which could include a wall in places. Mr. Trump had talked about deporting all illegal immigrants during the campaign, but appeared to soften that stance. In a <U+201C>60 Minutes<U+201D> interview that aired Sunday, he said he would aim to jail or deport between two million and three million illegal immigrants whom he described as criminals. On Sunday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said on CNN that House Republicans aren't focused on mass deportations of illegal immigrants. <U+201C>That is not what we<U+2019>re focused on. We<U+2019>re focused on securing the border,<U+201D> Mr. Ryan said. Mr. McCarthy said he would need to get more clarity on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s comments in the same interview that he would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act <U+201C>simultaneously,<U+201D> but indicated that Republicans wanted to create a transition plan so that people insured under the law wouldn't be left without coverage after its repeal. Mr. McCarthy also said he hoped any plan from Mr. Trump to improve the country<U+2019>s infrastructure wouldn't add to the debt. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s proposal for $1 trillion worth of new infrastructure construction relies entirely on private financing, which industry experts say is likely to fall far short of adequately funding improvements to roads, bridges and airports. A presidential transition website that went up this week said Mr. Trump planned to invest $550 billion in infrastructure, without offering details on where that funding would come from. <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve always expected bills to be paid for,<U+201D> Mr. McCarthy said. <U+201C>Do I still care about the debt? Yes. Growth will solve so many of our problems.<U+201D> Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com",

Because voters have no way to interpret FBI/DOJ activity in a neutral way. Who is the target of an investigation? What conduct? 7/ \n<U+2014> Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 This might be totally benign & not even involve Clinton. But no way for press or voters to know that. Easy for opponent to make hay over. 8/ \n<U+2014> Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 Which takes us back to the original rule: you don't comment on ongoing investigations. Then multiply that times ten close to an election. 9/ \n<U+2014> Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 \n\nMiller<U+2019>s hunch was confirmed later in the day as more details dribbled out. It turns out that the FBI discovered these emails while investigating former Congressman Anthony Weiner for inappropriate texts with a minor. The emails were found on a device Weiner shared with his estranged wife, longtime Hillary aide Huma Abedin. \nAccording to NBC News<U+2019> Pete Williams, however, there doesn<U+2019>t appear to be anything that even comes close to a smoking gun<U+2013>at least for now. Williams discussed his findings on MSNBC on Friday afternoon; watch here, via Jaffy<U+2019>s Twitter. NBC<U+2019>s Pete Williams: Sr. officials say<U+2014>During separate investigation <U+201C>a device<U+201D> led to add'l emails<U+2013>not from Clinton https://t.co/QmmNoxXhOx \n<U+2014> Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 28, 2016 \nWilliams went further in another MSNBC interview later in the afternoon; watch here. \nWilliams believes that there are two questions<U+2013>whether the number of emails changed, and whether anyone withheld evidence. His FBI sources tell him that those emails were not withheld by Hillary or her campaign. Moreover, the emails are not from Hillary. That raises the obvious question<U+2013>was there any defensible reason to make such a disclosure? \nMiller thinks there wasn<U+2019>t, and told CNN<U+2019>s Jake Tapper so later that afternoon. Watch here. \nMiller said that longstanding DOJ practice calls for the department and its various agencies to avoid doing anything that could potentially influence the results of an election within 60 days of Election Day. When Tapper asked Miller if the FBI could have been accused of bias toward Hillary had Comey remained silent, Miller said he didn<U+2019>t think so in this case because <U+201C>there<U+2019>s no information to be released.<U+201D> That letter never disclosed what triggered this new review, and thus forces Hillary to <U+201C>defend against a negative.<U+201D> \nUnderstandably, Hillary<U+2019>s campaign wants to know that justified this disclosure from the FBI. Campaign chairman John Podesta issued a burning statement demanding answers from the FBI.

The statement is a rebuke not only to Mr. Trump himself, but also to Liberty<U+2019>s president, Jerry Falwell, Jr. , who has been one of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s earliest and most influential supporters among evangelical Christians. Even as Mr. Falwell spoke on cable news Wednesday in defense of Mr. Trump<U+2014>who multiple women said this week had forcibly touched or kissed them in the past<U+2014>Liberty students were trying to distance themselves from the Republican nominee, writing that he<U+00A0><U+201C>is actively promoting<U+00A0>the very things that we as Christians ought to oppose.<U+201D> Mr. Trump has denied the sexual-assault allegations . More than 1,000 Liberty students had signed<U+00A0>the statement<U+00A0>online<U+00A0>by<U+00A0>Thursday<U+00A0>afternoon, less than 24 hours after it had been publicly released, organizers said. <U+201C>Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him,<U+201D> said the statement, issued by the group Liberty United Against Trump. The letter also criticized Mr. Falwell for backing Mr. Trump even after a video from 2005, released last week, showed him bragging about his efforts to seduce and grope women . Days later, at the second presidential debate , Mr. Trump said he never did any of the things he claimed on the tape. <U+201C>As if sexual assault is a shoulder-shrugging issue rather than an atrocity which plagues college campuses across America, including our own,<U+201D> the statement said. The rift at Liberty<U+00A0>University<U+2014>which<U+00A0>was founded in Lynchburg, Va., by Jerry Falwell, Sr., in 1971,<U+00A0>and is now, school officials say, the largest Christian university in the world<U+2014>follows a week in which the Trump video has divided conservative Christians and the Republican Party itself. At least one prominent religious leader has publicly pulled support for Mr. Trump,<U+00A0>while others who never backed him have been outspoken in their criticism. Many evangelical leaders have kept faith with the Republican nominee, however, including Mr. Falwell. In a telephone interview<U+00A0>on Thursday, Mr. Falwell said that, on a campus of 15,000 students, very few students had signed the statement denouncing Mr. Trump. Liberty has a total enrollment of more than 110,000, including online students, according to the school<U+2019>s website. <U+201C>I applaud their boldness<U+2014>I think it<U+2019>s a test of Liberty University<U+2019>s commitment to free expression of ideas and thought. They<U+2019>re willing to take a stand that goes against the grain,<U+201D> he said. He noted that Mike Pence, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s running mate, spoke to thousands of Liberty students on campus this week, and received multiple standing ovations. <U+201C>I believe Mr. Trump,<U+201D> he added, in response to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s denials of the sexual assault allegations made this week. <U+201C>I also believe he is a different man than he was 11 years ago when that video was<U+00A0>made<U+2026>It<U+00A0>reeks of desperation a little bit that the other side is resorting to these personal attacks, and they don<U+2019>t want to talk about the issues.<U+201D> Still, misgivings about Mr. Trump are widespread on campus. He received only a fraction of the vote in the precinct where Liberty is located during the Republican primary, months after Mr. Falwell<U+2019>s endorsement. Even the head of university<U+2019>s College Republicans organization<U+00A0>wouldn't commit to supporting<U+00A0>Mr. Trump after the video, though he wouldn't rule it out. Republican student organizations at several other nearby colleges<U+2014>including the University of Virginia<U+2014>have recently withdrawn their support for Mr. Trump, or expressed concerns about his candidacy. Savannah Barry, a 21-year-old senior at Liberty University, said that the campus is indeed divided over Mr. Trump. She hasn't signed the petition, but also said that she couldn't support the Republican nominee, and was unsure who she would vote for. <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve been very disappointed to see a lot of evangelical leaders who, even if they<U+2019>re supporting him, haven<U+2019>t necessarily denounced his comments,<U+201D> she said. When asked if she included Mr. Falwell in that list of evangelical leaders, she said, <U+201C>Yes, I do.<U+201D> Dustin Wahl, a 21-year-old junior<U+00A0>who wrote the statement against Mr. Trump, said Mr. Falwell<U+2019>s outspoken support has inexorably tied to the school to the candidate<U+2014>a connection that, several students said, has led people outside Lynchburg to assume the students were backing Mr. Trump. Mr. Wahl has never been a Trump supporter, and campaigned for Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida during the Republican primary contest. More students were signing the petition by the hour, Mr. Wahl said. Faculty were also signing, he said, though some were worried about reprisals and wouldn't put their names down. <U+201C>We respect President Falwell as our leader,<U+201D> Mr. Wahl said. <U+201C>But it<U+2019>s undeniable that what he<U+2019>s done has hurt Liberty University, and has hurt our national appeal. His leadership in this area has been horrible for the school.<U+201D> Write to Ian Lovett at ian.lovett@wsj.com",

Just ask Cisco Systems Inc. The network-equipment giant<U+2019>s shares fell in after-hours trading Wednesday, giving up the gains the stock has made since last week<U+2019>s election. Cisco was one of the few tech stocks to rally following the vote, as investors believed the company stood to benefit from President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s plans for big infrastructure projects, as well as a potential tax holiday for its bulging offshore bank accounts. That may all come to pass, but Cisco still has to contend with the here and now. The company<U+2019>s outlook for the quarter ending in January, which came as part of its fiscal first-quarter report Wednesday afternoon, was disappointing. Cisco projected a revenue decline between 2% and 4% year over year; analysts had been expecting a small gain. On its call, the company blamed a weak spending outlook for network service providers as the main reason for its caution. That will curb some enthusiasm for the stock, which is up 16% so far this year. It will also likely put more focus the company<U+2019>s war chest. About $71 billion sits in Cisco<U+2019>s coffers now, with about 90% residing offshore. Cisco<U+2019>s offshore cash balance is the third-largest in tech after Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Steve Milunovich of UBS estimates that if Cisco devotes half the repatriated cash to buybacks, it could retire about one-sixth of its shares. But that is still a big if, and Cisco in the meantime has to contend with the growth challenges of a mature business. Investors got ahead of themselves on the stock, and it won<U+2019>t be the first time in an unpredictable Trump era.",

Kennedy memorably stated that he was going to smash the CIA into <U+2018>a thousand pieces<U+2019>, he had very good reasons for doing so; half a century later, it can reasonably be assumed that similar phrases are being darkly muttered within the corridors of power about the FBI. \nPresident George W. Bush <U+201C>lost<U+201D> 22 million emails, many involving criminal investigations, and the FBI has said nothing, though the emails involved the White House used an illegal private server owned by the Republican Party for official government business. \nThe FBI is out to get Hillary Clinton, it<U+2019>s not Director Comey, Obama put him in there to clean up the mess, they<U+2019>ve been after Obama for 8 years. The <U+2018>birther<U+2019> hoax began, no we aren<U+2019>t kidding, inside the FBI <U+2013> it was the FBI that originated the wild rumour that Hillary Clinton murdered Vince Foster and that President Obama is not only a Muslim but many in the FBI actually say he<U+2019>s the anti-christ. \nLegal Analyst Paul Callan of CNN just published the following: \nLately, the FBI, while acting without the customary supervision of the Justice Department, appears to be a runaway train on a collision course with the concept of fairness in next week<U+2019>s presidential election. Democratic Senator Harry Reid and former White House ethics counsel Richard Painter have accused FBI Director James Comey of violating the Hatch Act by illegally using his office to influence the election. While the claim of a Hatch Act violation is a stretch, the appointment of an independent prosecutor and the replacement of Comey are nonetheless urgently required, if not outright overdue. The tangled relationship between the Clintons and Attorney General Loretta Lynch should have prompted appointment of an independent special prosecutor long ago.. \nHere<U+2019>s what Callan knew but wasn<U+2019>t able to write. The same informants that went to Callan also came to us and what they had to say was frightening. Here is how it began; an FBI insurrection and this is the exact term used by sources deep inside the FBI cabal, an FBI insurrection against, Comey, Hillary Clinton and Obama can no longer be safely ignored. This is why Senator Harry Reid has called for a criminal investigation of the FBI for violation of the Hatch Act. \nThe FBI, and this isn<U+2019>t Comey, it is the rank and file, the insurrectionist rank and file, a very powerful organisation that includes case managers, deputy directors that run not only counter-terrorism but financial crimes as well have not only targeted what they see to be dangerous liberal and progressive leaders, including of course the American president, but have continually protected criminals from prosecution as well. Those they have protected, possibly including names like Adelson, Trump and Romney, are funding moves against the US government, moves against American foreign policy and may well actually be funding recognised terror organisations as well, we have been specifically told this by sources within the FBI. \nThis insurrectional group within the FBI, which we are told includes the majority of FBI agents, has little idea what they have gotten into, some are aware they are taking orders from the shadowy Federalist Society, that <U+2018>right-wing conspiracy<U+2019> Hillary Clinton referred to so many years ago as trying to bring down her husband<U+2019>s presidency, but it goes deeper, it gets scarier; it isn<U+2019>t just <U+2018>birthers<U+2019>. \nThe public face of this is blocked court appointments and a government in paralysis, but it<U+2019>s far deeper and far more threatening, it all became possible when two branches of government fell under the control of organised crime. It took a five/four rigged Supreme Court and a rigged election in 2000, covered up by the FBI, to subvert for all times the independence of America<U+2019>s legislature. Rigged by Richard Mellon Scaife, funded by Sheldon Adelson, a cabal calling themselves <U+2018>Neocons<U+2019>, in reality a front for organised crime, reapportioned Congressional districts across the US in clear violation of equal protection provisions of the constitution and backed by five mob-controlled members of the Supreme Court, bolstered by vote flipping software from the CIA, control of the legislative/investigative branch of government was permanently placed in the hands of a minority, destroying any hope of separation of powers and undermining all constitutional protections. Any hope of Americans influencing their own destiny disappeared with a rigged legislature running endless witch hunts and a mob-controlled Supreme Court backing them up. \nMaking it worse, so much worse, was the creation of a massive security bureaucracy, the Department of Homeland Security, laws authorising torture and illegal surveillance and the destruction of the FBI. \nNo public scandal can be investigated, no regulation enforced, no-one is left to speak up, no-one is safe from illegal arrest and imprisonment, a nightmare from the pages of Kafka become reality, all this has become clear in the last few days. \nWhen a prominent US senator calls for the prosecution of America<U+2019>s national police force, is it perhaps time to take note? \nThere was a reason the constitution prohibited the creation of the national police force, just as the constitution prohibited the creation of a central bank; there is no mechanism capable of controlling a central bank, as the failures of the Federal Reserve board and a cursory study of American history since 1913 will establish. \nSimilarly, no provision was established within the constitution to regulate or oversee a national police force, it didn<U+2019>t take long for the FBI to become the Cheka within a short period after it<U+2019>s creation, J. Edgar Hoover, turned <U+2018>the bureau<U+2019> into a monstrosity blackmailing politicians and cosying up to crime figures while Hoover<U+2019>s FBI chased <U+2018>commies<U+2019> both real and imaginary, it protected not only the mafia but powerful international crime cartels as well, becoming the real <U+2018>Murder Inc.<U+2019> Taxpayer financed strong-arm thugs supported by a disinformation campaign. \nHoover gained control of the press almost immediately, keeping files on his press enemies, threatening and blackmailing; some of this was to protect his own secrets <U+2013> mob ties and his notorious penchant for sexual deviance, now long in the public domain, but it went further <U+2013> it was all about power. \n<U+2018>Mary<U+2019> Hoover liked to dress as a woman and was infamously covertly photographed along with his longtime companion and lover Clyde Tolson in flagrante delicto; those photographs came into the possession of mob kingpin Meyer Lansky, thus ensnaring Hoover, and by extension the entire FBI in a dangerous marriage with the mob. There is no evidence they ever got divorced, though from time to time the relationship may have been somewhat rocky. \nSimply put, given these facts, any sense of surprise at FBI misconduct or calls for investigating or even disbanding the FBI, should be no surprise to anyone. Nearly every current television series that features scenarios involving the FBI invariably focuses on FBI corruption, the FBI<U+2019>s illegal involvement in politics and gross incompetence. \nSit at a table and have lunch with the FBI, it can go one of two ways <U+2013> you can have brilliant, dedicated and relentless law enforcement officers who complain about being shackled by a corrupt bureaucracy, or like as not, a pack of delusional nutcases mouthing wild conspiracy theories and ranting about dangerous liberals; neither group, though widely divergent, make a case for the survival of the FBI. Then when you realise the Dept. of Homeland Security is entirely composed of conspiracy nutcases and other agencies are worse, it becomes clear that Harry Reid<U+2019>s demand to clean up the FBI is far from enough.",

The polls were suggesting that Mrs. Clinton would be the first woman elected president. She was already among the 266 women enshrined in the hall, a former bank building with pillars. Staff members suggested to Jeanne Giovannini, the president, that a new plaque should be available to a potential flood of jubilant visitors. <U+201C>We wanted to be ready,<U+201D> said Ms. Giovannini, who said she makes a point of maintaining political neutrality. They put the plaque in a second-floor office. It never came downstairs. Seneca Falls, cradle of the national movement for women<U+2019>s rights, was swept up by the same electoral cyclone that lifted Donald J. Trump , the Republican candidate, to the presidency. The town supported Mrs. Clinton, but barely. As of this week, she had tallied 1,740 votes here, giving her an edge of 74 votes over Mr. Trump, with absentee ballots still to be counted. In the county surrounding the town, also called Seneca, Mr. Trump was the decisive victor. The county election commissioners, Ruth Same, a Democrat, and Tiffany Folk, a Republican, said Mr. Trump had 6,719 votes as of Tuesday, about 52 percent of the vote, compared with 40 percent for Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Same, 72, has been a commissioner for 30 years. She and Ms. Folk, 45, consider themselves friends. Yet their reaction typifies the breach across America. <U+201C>I was shocked,<U+201D> Ms. Same said of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s defeat. Ms. Folk, for her part, said she has a deep appreciation for the region<U+2019>s role in the emergence of women<U+2019>s rights. <U+201C>I want a female president,<U+201D> Ms. Folk said. <U+201C>I would love to have a female president. This wasn<U+2019>t the right candidate.<U+201D> Seneca Falls, about midway between Syracuse and Rochester, is faced with some of the core struggles Mr. Trump targeted in the campaign. Companies such as Sylvania, which once produced television parts here, left years ago. Now Seneca Falls is recasting itself as a tourist destination, an effort involving two themes that collided for some voters in the election. Historically, this is where Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other giants of the women<U+2019>s rights movements gathered in 1848 to sign a <U+201C>Declaration of Sentiments,<U+201D> asserting that American women deserved equal status under the law. Stanton did not live to see the payoff: It would be another 72 years before women achieved the right to vote. A national park in Seneca Falls is intended to honor the 1848 convention. Plans for a centennial celebration of the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920 had been intensified by the hope that a female president might take part. Attendance at the national park has reached nearly 45,000 this year, the highest number since 1998, according to Jeffrey Olson, a spokesman for the National Park Service. Ms. Giovannini said those numbers correspond to a surge at the Hall of Fame, an increase she attributes primarily to excitement surrounding Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s candidacy. Seneca Falls also lays claim to another title, contending that it was the model for <U+201C>It<U+2019>s a Wonderful Life,<U+201D> Frank Capra<U+2019>s holiday movie classic. Every December, the town holds a festival built on that idea. The film is a capsule view of typical upstate New York aspirations. It offers the tale of a small community <U+2014> Bedford Falls <U+2014> that at the last moment manages to extricate itself from a downward spiral. Josh and Ashley Sanford, a Seneca Falls couple with 4-year-old twin sons, Nicholas and Gavyn, said they had put that kind of hope in their support for Mr. Trump. <U+201C>I want them to be able to be whatever they want to be,<U+201D> Ms. Sanford said of the twins, watching them play amid the fallen leaves. She is a registered nurse who goes on home visits, <U+201C>from rich houses by the lake to the poorest of the poor.<U+201D> Mr. Sanford works as a mechanic and fabricator. <U+201C>Our vets, our elderly, they<U+2019>ve got nothing,<U+201D> Ms. Sanford said. Some of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s statements might seem particularly discordant in Seneca Falls, such as his recorded comments about groping women. Bill Lewis and Donna Phillips Lewis explained it this way: Mr. Trump, they said, hides nothing about who he is or how he feels, even when it is ugly, which makes him the opposite of Mrs. Clinton and many other politicians. <U+201C>He can be redeemed,<U+201D> said Mr. Lewis, 67, a retired minister for the Church of the Nazarene. He and Ms. Lewis returned here eight years ago to care for older parents. They said gender had played no role in their vote: They are opposed to abortion rights and said Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s opportunity to appoint at least one Supreme Court justice would have created a reckless, <U+201C>wide open<U+201D> American society. <U+201C>She wasn<U+2019>t acceptable to God,<U+201D> Ms. Lewis said. Pam Bryan, who runs the Copy Shop in downtown Seneca Falls, said Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s defeat was shattering. She said she was frightened by Mr. Trump. <U+201C>At least now we can stop lying to our daughters and nieces and granddaughters when we tell them they can be anything they want to be,<U+201D> Ms. Bryan said. Becky Bly, another downtown merchant, moved here from Long Island to run WomanMade Products, whose inventory honors the town<U+2019>s heritage. This week Ms. Bly paused while hanging a painting of the fictional Bedford Falls in her storefront window to warn that Mr. Trump is more apt to create a <U+201C>Pottersville,<U+201D> referring to the ruthless tycoon in Mr. Capra<U+2019>s film. The nation<U+2019>s future, she said, <U+201C>will be determined by which Trump decides to show himself.<U+201D> On that point, Seneca Falls seems to be in agreement. At the Hall of Fame, Ms. Giovannini said the wording would be changed <U+2014> again <U+2014> on Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s new plaque, this time to reflect the fact that she won the popular vote, even while losing the election. Pat Alnes and Dorothy Lind, staff members at the hall, said that after the election a young Clinton campaign worker had pulled off the New York State Thruway to pay an impromptu visit. The worker began weeping, revealing a grief shared by many visitors who have made the pilgrimage since Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory. Ms. Giovannini said resilience amid disappointment is at the core of the women<U+2019>s rights movement, and this is a reminder the staff gently shares with guests. <U+201C>Like the suffragettes,<U+201D> Ms. Giovannini said, <U+201C>you keep going.<U+201D> Correction: November 22, 2016 An article on Friday about how the presidential election played out in Seneca Falls, N.Y., the cradle of the national women<U+2019>s rights movement, misstated, in some editions, the women who gathered there in 1848 to sign a <U+201C>Declaration of Sentiments.<U+201D> Elizabeth Cady Stanton was there, Susan B. Anthony was not. A version of this article appears in print on November 18, 2016, on Page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: Election Themes Clash in a Capra-esque Town.

I won<U+2019>t even bother to link them, because who cares. You already know what they<U+2019>re saying. \nThree of them are written by the same woman, Lisa O<U+2019>Carroll. \nOne has to wonder if she wasn<U+2019>t one of the women who were using the Calais camp as a sex tourism destination . \nYou can ask her about it on Twitter. \n@lisaocarroll \nThis situation is insane though, holmes. \nThese people invaded Europe, mostly from Africa. None of them are legitimate <U+201C>refugees,<U+201D> or they would claim that status. They are allowed to stay in France indefinitely, where they are clothed and fed, but they want to go to Britain because the welfare system is so good. They set up an illegal squatter base next to the freeway, and used it to break into trucks bound for the UK and to launch random violent attacks on cars <U+2013> very often just throwing rocks for no reason. \nThis week, 7 years after it was founded in 2009, they finally closed it and forced out the inhabitants, because basically it had become impossible to safely pass from France to England in a car. And the entire media is saying that the act of closing the camp is nothing short of pure and unadulterated evil. \nThe way they<U+2019>re selling it? \nBy showing pictures of men between the ages of 25 and 45, saying they<U+2019>re teenagers and calling them <U+201C>children.<U+201D> \nIt<U+2019>s like something out of an absurdist comedy. But most everything is these days. \nAnyhow, these women, cucks and kikes are eventually going to get their way. Migrants are already moving back in, as the fires have died down from where they set their own squat on fire when they were asked to leave. \nMigrants have started moving back into the <U+201C>Jungle<U+201D>, hours after French authorities announced they had finished clearing out the Calais camp. \nThousands of migrants were evacuated as multiple large blazes raged across the sprawling camp in northern France. \nBy midday, regional prefect Fabienne Buccio had said operations to clear the camp, which began on Monday, had been completed days earlier than planned. \n<U+201C>There are no more migrants in the camp,<U+201D> she told the Associated Press news agency. \nI said this would happen. Everyone knew it would happen. White Europeans have no will to do what needs to be done, so these animals are simply allowed to do whatever they want. \nWhat needs to be done is of course race war. \nThese people need to be rounded up and deported back to Africa, and if they refuse and start fires, they need to be shot. \nThis situation isn<U+2019>t complicated or nuanced in any way. \nBut that won<U+2019>t happen. \nBecause Europe is ruled by the coalition of evil: empowered women, cucks and kikes.",

Knowing full well that he was 100% guilty as charged, he decided to look right into the unblinking eye of the camera and issue a full-throated denial of any involvement of any kind. Watch and see it for yourself: Bill Clinton denies having an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky: \nNow what Bill Clinton did not know was that Monica had saved a semen-stained blue dress with Bill Clinton<U+2019>s semen on it, which she promptly presented as evidence to prove that she was not lying. By this time she was being trashed by Clinton operatives desperate to save Bill<U+2019>s presidency, chief of whom was Crooked Hillary who had lots of nasty things to say about her husband<U+2019>s victims. That led to this moment as seen here: Bill Clinton admits to having an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky: Interestingly, in 2016 at the height of the race for president, Hillary decides to adopt Bill<U+2019>s bold denial strategy \nHillary Clinton<U+2019>s campaign hopes, as reported by Bloomberg today , its unusually swift response to revelations about a fresh FBI investigation into messages in connection with a past probe of her private e-mail server will blunt the political damage amid concern about close Senate races as well as the presidential election. \nWith nine days to go until the election , Clinton and her aides went on the attack, intensifying criticism of James Comey as word emerged that the FBI director defied U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch by informing lawmakers of newly discovered e-mails that may relate to its investigation of the Democratic presidential nominee. Hillary Clinton addresses FBI email investigation: \nClinton<U+2019>s aggressive strategy contrasts with her bunker mentality in previous episodes of the controversy over her e-mail practices at the State Department. Her campaign is taking a calculated risk in publicly criticizing Comey and pressing him to quickly release more detail. Should new information contradict past statements or call into question the judgment of Clinton or any of her advisers who migrated from the Obama administration to her campaign, it could be damaging. \nHer rival Donald Trump told an audience in Phoenix the <U+201C>only reason<U+201D> Comey must have felt the need to tell lawmakers of the newly discovered e-mails is that <U+201C>very, very serious things must be happening and must have been found. Very, very serious. Very, very serious.<U+201D> \nSince Crooked Hillary has no idea what the FBI actually found, her gambit is every bit as bold, and reckless, as was her husband<U+2019>s decades earlier. She has now painted herself into the proverbial corner, and any evidence that the FBI produces will be amplified in light of her vigorous denials. The WikiLeaks emails showed us that even John Podesta said she <U+201C>lacks judgment<U+201D> and discernment , and this is certain proof of that. \nBut such is life when you<U+2019>re a Clinton.

One of his daughters has since moved to Saudi Arabia where she has married. \nThe family could be receiving more than <U+00A3>320,000 a year in benefits according to a financial manager on the Employers<U+2019> Association website. \nThere is no official confirmation on this figure. \nUnder Islamic tradition, the 49-year-old can have up to four wives <U+2013> as long as he can support them financially. \nDon<U+2019>t forget everyone, all cultures are equal so you have to respect a culture that says it<U+2019>s okay to have four wives and 22 children that the rest of society supports. \nSince Germany doesn<U+2019>t legally recognize polygamy <U+2014> being a civilized country and all (not for long) <U+2014> they couldn<U+2019>t all live together and get benefits. But don<U+2019>t worry, Ghazia found a way to be compliant with the law and get German taxpayers on the hook for his lifestyle. Isn<U+2019>t multiculturalism just swell? \nHow it works is that Ghazia chose a <U+201C>main wife,<U+201D> and now the other three and their children get government benefits to support them. \nGhazia, his main wife, and their five children live in Montabaur, which is located in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. His other wives and children are spread around up to 31 miles away. \nBack in Syria, Ghazia worked in a garage and car hire service, but ever since he settled in Germany and received government benefits for his family, he just can<U+2019>t seem to find the time to work anymore. \nHe claimed that he wants to work, but because of his religion he has to make sure he spends enough time with each family. Ghazia told German newspaper Bild: <U+201C>In our religion it is my duty to visit every family and to be with them.<U+201D> \nSergei Jaufmann, a neighbor of Ghazia, said according to the Express: <U+201C>The children play football in the street. The mother I often see, when [she] comes from shopping.<U+201D> \nAccording to the Express, a social media user noted that <U+201C>the Syrian with 4 women and 23 children is now being sold to us as a new normality.<U+201D> \nYes it is. This is a prime example of how globalists are actively working to tear down the western world. Refugees and immigrants aren<U+2019>t expected to assimilate to the culture; the culture is expected to adapt to them. And not only that, you get to pay for it. \nSorry, all cultures aren<U+2019>t equal and people from around the world that are clamoring to get into the west <U+2014> aside from the terrorists that we<U+2019>re supposed to pretend aren<U+2019>t abusing immigrant/refugee streams <U+2014> know that full well, which is why they want to come here and take advantage of what western culture built.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: opednews.com \n text: License DMCA \nMiddle East policy has reached an inflexion point, a moment when Official Washington seems to be caught in the middle between escalation and retreat. \nOn one hand, the rhetoric has not been more militant since Hillary Clinton's famous \"we came, we saw, he died\" moment in October 2011. With Barack Obama halfway out the door and Clinton all but crowned, Washington's laptop bombardiers are rejoicing that the half-measures are over and judgment day nearly at hand. \nThus, The New York Times assures us that that the Middle East is \"desperate for American leadership\" while the Washington Post reports that \"the Republicans and Democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the ground work for a more assertive American foreign policy.\" \nLeading think tanks are publishing \"a flurry of reports\" urging stepped-up intervention, including U.S.-backed \"safe zones to protect moderate rebels from Syrian and Russian forces\" and even \"limited\" cruise-missile strikes. But while differing on the details, all agree something must be done. The time to act is now. \nAs Vox puts it: \"The hot new policy idea in Washington is the hottest old idea: direct US military intervention in Syria's civil war.\" - Advertisement - \nBut reading between the lines, a very different picture emerges, a realization that the U.S. has painted itself into a corner and that there is little it can do after all. Thus, the Times observes that while the Middle East is clamoring for U.S. leadership, it is not clamoring for Bush-style intervention but for some mythical \"middle ground\" in between him and Obama. \nWhile reporting that pro-escalation sentiment is unanimous in Washington's vast foreign-policy establishment -- sometimes known as \" the blob \" -- the Washington Post notes that \"even pinprick cruise-missile strikes designed to hobble the Syrian air force or punish [President Bashar al-]Assad would risk a direct confrontation with Russian forces\" and wonders whether a war-weary public will support any intervention at all. \n\"My concern is that we may be talking to each other and agreeing with each other,\" it quotes one expert as saying, \"but that these discussions are isolated from where the public may be right now.\" \nOfficial Washington in a Bubble \nThus, even the Establishment worries that it lives in a bubble. Washington wants war, it needs war, and yet it admits in practically the same breath that it can't have it. So what will it do? - Advertisement - \nThen there are the mild liberals over at Vox, the hip and successful Washington website founded by journalistic wunderkind Ezra Klein. Voxers pride themselves on being sharp and practical yet in the end they are sealed off as well. The poster boy for this tendency is Zack Beauchamp, a young writer who stars in a recent Vox video entitled, \" The crisis in Aleppo, explained in 4 minutes .\" \nAs Beauchamp lectures away amid fancy graphics and cool background music, the video faithfully toes the Washington line, both the stirring gung-ho part and the downbeat refrain that inevitably follows. Thus, he describes the Syrian civil war as a \"story of flip-flops,\" with Assad seemingly on the ropes until Iran and Russia put him back on his feet, at which point the Saudis and Qataris put the rebels back on their feet so the game can continue. \nBut the real turning point, he says, occurred in September 2015 when Russia stepped in with airstrikes that allowed the government to besiege the Salafists in eastern Aleppo. \n\"A siege,\" Beauchamp then explains, \"involves trapping a group of people, civilians and fighters both, inside a certain territory and denying them supplies until they can no longer fight. Assad's strategy has a vicious logic to it. When you deprive people of food and you bomb them over and over again, they're likely to give in just to make the fighting stop.\"",

It could include exchanges about illegal financing or corruption, and others concerning the links between the Clintons, the Muslim Brotherhood and the jihadists.\nVoltaire Network | Damascus (Syria) | 1 November 2016 <U+03B5><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AC> Espa<U+00F1>ol fran<U+00E7>ais T<U+00FC>rk<U+00E7>e <U+0440><U+0443><U+0441><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> Deutsch Hillary Clinton and her chief of staff Huma Abedin. The reprise of the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s private e-mails no longer concerns questions of security, but rather acts of skulduggery and cheating which could be as serious as high treason.\nTechnically, instead of using one of the secured servers of the Federal State, the Secretary of State had ordered the installation of a private server in her home, in order to be able to use the Internet without leaving any trace on a machine belonging to the Federal State. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s private technician had voided the server before the arrival of the FBI, so that it was impossible to know why she had set up such a network.\nFirst of all, the FBI noted that the private server was not protected by the same security system as the State Department server. Thus Mrs. Clinton had only committed a security fault. Secondly, the FBI confiscated the computer of former Congressman Anthony Weiner, the ex-husband of Huma Abedin, Hillary<U+2019>s chief of staff. The FBI found e-mails from the Secretary of State on his computer.\nAnthony Weiner is a Jewish politician who is very close to the Clintons, and who harboured the ambition of becoming mayor of New York. He was obliged to resign following a very Puritan scandal <U+2013> he had sent erotic SMS<U+2019>s to a young woman who was not his wife. Huma Abedin officially separated from him during the scandal, but in reality, did not leave him.\nHuma Abedin is a US citizen who was raised in Saudi Arabia. Her father is director of an academic revue <U+2013> of which, for many years, she was the sub-editor <U+2013> which regularly prints comments from the Muslim Brotherhood. Her mother is president of the Saudi association of female members of the Brotherhood, and worked with the wife of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi. Her brother Hassan works for Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, the religious authority of the Brotherhood and spiritual counsellor of Al-Jazeera.\nDuring an official journey to Saudi Arabia, the Secretary of State visits Dar al-Hekma college, accompanied by Saleha Abedin (mother of her chief of staff), president of the association of the Sister members of the Brotherhood. Huma Abedin is today a central figure of the Clinton campaign, alongside the campaign director, John Podesta, ex-General Secretary of the White House under the Presidency of Bill Clinton. Podesta is also the appointed Congressional lobbyist for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia <U+2013> for the modest amount of $200,000 per month. On 12 June 2016, Petra, the official Press agency of Jordan, published an interview with the crown prince of Arabia, Mohamed Ben Salmane, in which he affirmed the modernity of his family, which had illegally financed Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s Presidential campaign to the tune of 20%, despite the fact that she is a woman. The day after this publication, the agency cancelled the dispatch and claimed that its Internet site had been hacked.\nAccording to the official Jordanian Press agency, Petra, published on 12 June 2016, the Saudi royal family illegally financed 20% of Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s Presidential campaign. Mrs. Abedin is not the only member of the Obama administration linked to the Brotherhood. The US President<U+2019>s half-brother, Abon<U+2019>go Malik Obama, is the Treasurer for the Brotherhood<U+2019>s missionary work in Sudan, and also President of the Barack H. Obama Foundation. He is under the direct orders of the Sudanese President, Omar el-B<U+00E9>chir. A Muslim Brother is a member of the National Security Council - the highest executive position in the United States. From 2009 to 2012, this was the case of Mehdi K. Alhassani. We do not know who succeeded him, but the White House denied that a Muslim Brother was a member of the Council until the proof surfaced. A Muslim Brother, Rashad Hussain, is also US ambassador to the Islamic Conference. The other Brothers who have been identified occupy less important functions. However, we must name Louay M. Safi, a current member of the Syrian National Coalition and ex-advisor to the Pentagon.\nPresident Obama and his half-brother Abon<U+2019>go Malik Obama in the Oval Office. Abon<U+2019>go Malik is the Treasurer of the Missionary work of the Muslim Brotherhood in Sudan. In April 2009, two months before his speech in Cairo, President Obama secretly received a delegation of the Brotherhood in the Oval Office. During his induction, he had already invited Ingrid Mattson, the President of the Association of Muslim Brothers and Sisters in the United States.\nFrom their side, the Clinton Foundation had employed Gehad el-Haddad as director for his <U+00AB>Climate<U+00BB> project - he is one of the world leaders of the Brotherhood, and had until that time been director of a Koranic TV programme. His father was one of the co-founders of the Brotherhood, when it was created by the CIA and MI6 in 1951. Gehad left the Foundation in 2012, when he became the spokeman for candidate Mohammed Morsi in Cairo, and then the official spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood world-wide.\nGiven that all the jihadist leaders in the world have either come from the Muslim Brotherhood or the Sufi Order of the Naqshband<U+00EE>s <U+2013> the two components of the Muslim World League, the Saudi anti-Arab nationalist organisation <U+2013> we would like to know more about Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s relations with Saudi Arabia and the Muslim Brotherhood.\nAs it happens, in the team of her challenger, Donald Trump, we note the presence of General Michael T. Flynn, who attempted to oppose the creation of the Caliphate by the White House, and resigned from the direction of the Defense Intelligence Agency in order to signal his disapproval. He works alongside Frank Gaffney, a historical <U+00AB>Cold Warrior<U+00BB>, now qualified as a <U+00AB>conspiracy theorist<U+00BB> for having denounced the presence of the Brotherhood in the Federal State.\nIt goes without saying that from the FBI<U+2019>s point of view, any support for jihadist organisations is a crime, whatever the policy of the CIA may be. In 1991, the police <U+2013> and Senator John Kerry <U+2013> had provoked the ecollapse of BCCI, a Pakistani bank (although it is registered in the Cayman Islands), which the CIA used for all sorts of secret operations with the Muslim Brotherhood and also the Latino drug cartels.\nThierry Meyssan Translation\nPete Kimberley",

Early in the morning, Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Matthias M<U+00FC>ller and his aide, Hans-Gerd Bode, climbed into the back of a Porsche Panamera luxury sedan and switched on the TV monitor to watch live coverage of the U.S. election on German morning television. The firm has spent the past year embroiled in a global emissions scandal , and is in the middle of discussions with officials in Washington over a settlement of criminal proceedings. As the driver steered through the streets of Stuttgart and onto the A8 highway to Munich, where Mr. M<U+00FC>ller was due to speak at an auto industry conference later in the day, he was stunned that Mr. Trump had been elected. <U+201C>He was wondering about the election prognosis and all those experts who mentioned during the last weeks that Clinton is more in front than Trump,<U+201D> Mr. Bode said. As the car sped along the Autobahn, Mr. M<U+00FC>ller also wondered what impact Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election would have on Volkswagen<U+2019>s negotiations with U.S. authorities. Later in the day, Mr. Muller told reporters he hoped the election result <U+201C>won<U+2019>t have more negative consequences for Volkswagen,<U+201D> he said. Airbus Group SE Chief Executive Tom Enders in Toulouse, France, learned about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s likely victory when he woke up before 4:45 a.m. local time. He swapped messages with his communications chief, Rainer Ohler. The plane maker has big customers for its commercial jets in the U.S., as well as a big, pending order from Iran. That was made possible by Obama administration efforts to lift sanctions on Tehran <U+2014>a deal Mr. Trump has opposed. <U+201C>We both couldn<U+2019>t believe it,<U+201D> said Mr. Ohler. Mr. Enders went for his daily run, anyway, and then met Mr. Ohler at Airbus<U+2019>s headquarters to watch Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory speech on TV. Santo Versace, chairman of Milan-based fashion house Gianni Versace, woke early Wednesday to see the results of the election. Even before the result was called, he got the sense that Mr. Trump had the edge. He began to text friends saying the Republican was on the brink of victory. <U+201C>But I got no reply,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Only silence. If I were American, I would probably have voted for Hillary. But this is a victory against the political establishment and that<U+2019>s what she represented.<U+201D> Marco Bizzarri, chief executive of fashion house Gucci, had just landed in Paris from a flight from Beijing when he was surprised to hear the news of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory. <U+201C>My first thought was that pollsters should consider changing jobs,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>They are totally unable to capture the intentions of people in an interconnected world.<U+201D> Write to William Boston at william.boston@wsj.com and Manuela Mesco at manuela.mesco@wsj.com",

Asked what the purpose of his visit was, McFaul said it was to help presidential candidate Hillary Clinton prepare for what he assumed would be her transition to the White House.Now McFaul, currently a Stanford University professor, is banned from Russia and Kremlin sources say he is the first of many Clinton allies to be banned.Mr McFaul said: <U+201C>I have hundreds of friends in Russia. I<U+2019>m really sorry that these sanctions will make communicating with people harder. <U+201C>I was told that I am on the Kremlin<U+2019>s sanctions list because of my close affiliation with Obama.<U+201D> The Russian Foreign Ministry did not publicly confirm the ban, but ministry sources told Russian news agencies McFaul had been added to the sanctions list.He was not banned because of his support for President Obama, a Foreign Ministry source told the TASS and RIA news agencies, but because of his <U+201C>active participation in the destruction of the bilateral relationship and relentless lobbying in favour of the Clinton campaign to destabilize Russia.<U+201D>President Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Donald Trump following his election victory, telling the tycoon that he had followed the election closely.Russia is hoping for a <U+201C>new understanding<U+201D> and <U+201C>restored Russian-American relations<U+201D> according to Kremlin sources, with President Putin said to be <U+201C>encouraged<U+201D> by the American people voting to back themselves and reject the prospect of a New World Order totalitarian world government.According to sources, Putin believes that the result of the U.S. election proves the globalists<U+2019> destructive agenda is deeply unpopular with real people, and when given a chance they will instinctively reject it out of hand. <U+201C>The American people stood up against the media, the banks, the establishment, everything was against them, but they said enough.

His expression was a sort of upbeat blur. His voice was a lulling drone. It wasn<U+2019>t exactly a vivid performance, but it was an eerily consistent one, and it answered the question of how a man who supposedly prides himself on his virtue defends a running mate who is often bereft of it. He sets his jaw. He slows his pulse. He practices a bemused chuckle, perfects deafness to anything he prefers not to hear and purges from his memory anything he doesn<U+2019>t want to own. That included the whole grotesque cornucopia of Donald Trump<U+2019>s slurs and bad behavior, which Tim Kaine had studied up on exhaustively, knew by heart and kept throwing at Pence, pressing for the barest glimmer of shame or the slightest hint of apology. It was pointless <U+2014> a point that Kaine himself made about an hour into this exercise in futility. <U+201C>Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence: I can<U+2019>t imagine how you can defend your running mate<U+2019>s position on one issue after the next,<U+201D> Kaine said, his voice somewhat squeaky with frustration. <U+201C>And in all six cases, he<U+2019>s refused to defend his running mate, and yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend.<U+201D> That<U+2019>s a fair enough summary of the vice-presidential debate, and it flagged what made the event so fascinating, which was Pence <U+2014> specifically, the astonishing peace he has made with Trump and his wholehearted readiness to promote a man who should be so offensive to him. In the face of Kaine<U+2019>s incessant grilling, Pence blithely denied that Trump had made statements that he inarguably had, changed the subject to Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s failings, mocked Kaine for being scripted and dismissed Kaine and Clinton as career politicians <U+2014> ignoring the fact that he fits that description, too. Substantively, it was galling. Strategically, it may well have worked. With his minimalist speaking style, Pence drew attention to Kaine<U+2019>s maximalist salvos. Pence<U+2019>s unflappability threw Kaine<U+2019>s irritation and interruptions into relief. One of Pence<U+2019>s assignments was to counter Trump<U+2019>s childish excitability with adult calm, which he did almost flawlessly. Another of his assignments was to make Trump palatable to wavering Americans by communicating that Trump was positively yummy to him. He aced that, too, meaning that he<U+2019>s either a phenomenally talented actor or a master of self-deception. I wrongly expected that the debate would be a letdown, especially after last week<U+2019>s blistering matchup of Trump and Clinton. Following that face-off with this one was like chasing a Quentin Tarantino movie with a rerun of <U+201C>Touched by an Angel<U+201D> <U+2014> or so I assumed. But I was forgetting the devil in Pence and what an engrossing, depressing character study the Indiana governor has turned out to be. It<U+2019>s hard to think of a vice-presidential candidate in modern history who has gone so far against his supposed nature and his proclaimed values in the service of his running mate. He has always worn his religiousness conspicuously, even flamboyantly, introducing himself time and again as <U+201C>a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.<U+201D> In 1991, after losing a race for the United States Congress in which he harshly attacked his opponent, he published an essay, <U+201C>Confessions of a Negative Campaigner,<U+201D> in which he invoked Jesus and mentioned sin as he swore off such ugliness in the future. <U+201C>Negative campaigning is wrong,<U+201D> he wrote, adding, <U+201C>A campaign ought to demonstrate the basic human decency of the candidate.<U+201D> The Trump campaign has demonstrated anything but, and yet Pence has repeatedly vouched for Trump, even as Trump savaged the Muslim parents of a soldier who died defending America, seemed to encourage Second Amendment enthusiasts to take aim at Clinton, pinned the birther conspiracy on her , and spent the days after his own debate <U+2014> a disastrous one <U+2014> lashing out at a former Miss Universe and tweeting about pornography. On Tuesday night Pence rewarded Trump<U+2019>s inane, insane antics with a debate performance that reflected fierce determination and precisely the kind of thorough preparation that Trump had skipped. Pence didn<U+2019>t forget to bring up the Clinton Foundation. Or the <U+201C>basket of deplorables,<U+201D> a knife he twisted dexterously. Never has he taken Trump to task or taken a stand for <U+201C>basic human decency.<U+201D> He seems to have reversed the order of those three adjectives in his identity. <U+201C>Republican<U+201D> now comes first and <U+201C>Christian<U+201D> last. Maybe he<U+2019>ll atone and make amends in another post-campaign <U+201C>Confessions.<U+201D> God knows he has plenty of material.

LOL. ROTFL. Excuse me, I can<U+2019>t stop laughing<U+2026>a nervous, manic kind of laughter that also makes one of my eyes twitch. Why? This is coming from the spokesperson of a woman who is trying to pull in young voters and calling them <U+201C>F*&$ing dumb<U+201D> behind their backs. This is coming from the spokesperson of a woman who is trying to connect with the American people at the same time as saying she has no clue about real life due to her background. This is coming from the spokesperson of a woman who preaches honesty and integrity and practices neither, saying in a paid speech that sometimes you have to lie. I have never heard a more ridiculous, two-faced audacious comment in my whole life. And considering I write about politics, I<U+2019>ve heard a lot over the years. Speaking of double standards, did you hear the latest about the re-opened email investigation? The incestuous connection between the Clinton campaign and the Department of Justice continues. The person in charge of the new investigation is none other than Peter Kadzik. Kadzik has a long history with both the Clinton family and campaign manager John Podesta. Podesta wrote <U+201C> The Power of Progress<U+201D> in 2008, in which he outlined his plan to save the world. And by longtime connections, I mean<U+2026> Kadzik represented John Podesta after he perjured himself during the Monica Lewinsky case Kadzik lobbied for Marc Rich, a fugitive that was pardoned by then-President Bill Clinton Kadzik led the effort to nominate Loretta Lynch as Attorney General Kadzik had a celebratory dinner with Podesta the day after the Benghazi hearings Kadzik denied a request from Republicans to appoint special counsel in the last Clinton email investigation Kadzik and Podesta appear from Wikileaks to be the best of friends, celebrating birthdays and other occasions together Those are some of the links between Kadzik and Clintonland <U+2013> check out this very thorough report on Zero Hedge for all of the details. Can you imagine the hue and cry if Donald Trump<U+2019>s nearest and dearest ran the investigation about his alleged links with Russia? How is this possibly okay? Open letter to Peter Kadzik After stumbling across Kadzik<U+2019>s email address in an online group (by the way, it<U+2019>s [email protected] <U+2013> don<U+2019>t they every learn about email security?) I sent this very polite email suggesting that he recuse himself from the investigation. Dear Mr. Kadzik: When I learned that you were to be the person in charge of the investigation into Huma Abedin and her emails, I was curious to learn about your connections. With just a teeny tiny bit of Googling, I was aghast to discover that you have a close friendship with John Podesta, Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s campaign manager.I was further discomfited by the fact that you have direct connections with the Obamas and the Clintons themselves. While I<U+2019>m sure you take your job very seriously, it seems to me a direct conflict of interest for you to handle this investigation. I strongly urge you to do the right thing and recuse yourself from overseeing this investigation. If you find the emails without merit, there was always be a cloud over your findings due to your close connections with the Clintons, President Obama, and Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign. Please hand this over to independent investigators who can do this job without the appearance of bias. Sincerely, Daisy Luther Surprisingly, I<U+2019>ve had no response to my courteous request. He<U+2019>s probably out there busily finding a non-biased replacement. Article first posted at DaisyLuther.com Submit your review",

Arrests at rallies for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have been a focal point of news coverage, with videos showing both protesters and supporters being involved in altercations. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s rallies have also had protests, resulting in a handful of arrests, though they haven<U+2019>t resulted in the number of arrests or level of violence seen at Trump rallies. The nominating conventions saw arrests and citations, but not on the scale of some past election cycles: the Democratic National Convention had 11 arrests and 101 citations, while the Republican National Convention had 23 arrests. That<U+2019>s compared with about 650 arrests during the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. Joe Funk, president of security firm U.S. Safety & Security and a retired Secret Service agent, attributed the lower numbers to prepared, effective policing. Part of the tension, Mr. Funk said, was the result of emotions running high among the electorate. He added that he thought both sides were using rhetoric to stoke their base, leading to the tension that could cause violence. <U+201C>These outbursts, this violence is not spontaneous,<U+201D> Mr. Funk said. <U+201C>To think that would happen on this scale, spread out over the country as it is, is not reasonable.<U+201D> Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney <U+2019>s rallies didn<U+2019>t see the level of violence Mr. Trump<U+2019>s have stirred up, and Mr. Romney<U+2019>s director of advance, Will Ritter, said he couldn<U+2019>t recall any arrests being made at 2012 rallies. Mr. Ritter laid the blame for the violence partially at the feet of Mr. Trump, who he said is <U+201C>whipping...up<U+201D> his crowds. <U+201C>These are all things that normal politicians, and honestly just decent people, wouldn<U+2019>t be doing,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s bordering on inciting a riot.<U+201D> When asked to comment on what Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign does to secure rallies, campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email, <U+201C>Our goal is to ensure our rallies are safe and enjoyed by all in attendance.<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign hasn<U+2019>t responded to request for comment. The Romney campaign<U+2019>s approach was to <U+201C>throw cold water on the situation,<U+201D> Mr. Ritter said. Those who seemed likely to cause trouble, whether Romney supporters or protesters, were not allowed into events. Mr. Funk said that approach was typical, identifying the potential trouble-makers before they entered the event. While both campaigns have Secret Service protection, security at events is up to the campaigns, who coordinate with private security and local and state law-enforcement agencies, depending on the location of the rally. <U+201C>We only become involved when there<U+2019>s an overt act toward one of our protectees,<U+201D> said Cathy Milhoan, communications director for the U.S. Secret Service. Ms. Milhoan said anything that appears to be a potentially chaotic scene is worked out in advance between security forces and the campaign. The Romney campaign removed protesters on occasion, who typically went peacefully, Mr. Ritter said.",

And it heard me! It was around two in the morning and I went inside to read an article my mother had left up for me.

Late today, Podesta's Twitter account sent out a strange tweet reading: \"I've switched teams.Vote Trump 2015.Hi pol\" Story Continued Below The tweet was quickly deleted, but the Clinton campaign confirmed the account had been hacked. \"We can confirm John's Twitter account was hacked, which would explain the message,\" spokesman Nick Merrill told reporters in Las Vegas. Podesta is already in the news because of an ongoing WikiLeaks dump of his apparent personal Gmail account. The trove of emails have revealed snippets of the much-sought-after paid speeches that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton gave to Goldman Sachs and others after leaving the State Department. Podesta has said the FBI is investigating the hack of his email account. But he <U+2014> and the Clinton campaign more broadly <U+2014> have declined to confirm the accuracy of any individual emails. Podesta claimed the FBI was looking into the digital theft as part of a broader investigation into an alleged Moscow-orchestrated cyber assault on the U.S. electoral system. On Friday, U.S. intelligence officials blamed the Kremlin for the recent digital break-ins at a number of political institutions, including the Democratic National Committee. The hacks, and subsequent leak of pilfered documents and emails, have roiled the Democrats and forced the ouster of several top DNC officials after internal messages showed the committee apparently favoring Clinton<U+2019>s White House bid over that of her rival, Sen.

        "input": "time: null \n author: James Hall \n source: thesleuthjournal.com \n text: in: Corporate Takeover , Economy & Business , Globalism Ivory tower economists, corporate business analysts and financial experts routinely trash any discussion that America needs to institute a national economic policy that actually benefits our own country. The mantra of unchallenged doctrine that globalism is the only path for world commerce has been intensively pushed for well over the last half century. How well did the United States fare? An honest evaluation must acknowledge the diminishing middle class has paid the greatest penalty from the corporatist sedition that has destroyed internal independence and productive prosperity. Building viable enterprises that conduct useful economic activities produce needed and desirable goods and services. Good paying jobs grow when the velocity of money flows in the <U+201C>real<U+201D> domestic economy. International trade can and is often advantageous if it benefits all parties involved in prosperity from the transactions. However, in the un-free framework for maximizing the corporatism structure of above and beyond any particular country jurisdiction or trade policies, the globalists have set up the exact opposite from the much lauded <U+201C>Free Trade<U+201D> conduit. The next argument points out the inconsistency in Economic Nationalism in the Age of Globalism , and asks: <U+201C>Is economic nationalism a reaction to global integration, which in essence means cooptation and domination of national markets by the strongest multinational corporations of the richest nations? Neoliberal insist on the forces of the free market operating without government interference to protect the national capitalist class and workers. Naturally, neoliberals advocating global integration have come out against the tide of economic nationalism in any form. However, the same advocates of neoliberalism have no problem supporting corporate welfare in their own countries, a system that is a form of economic nationalism. When governments use taxpayer money to bail banks and subsidize corporations that is a form of economic nationalism, just as when they lobby to have products and services of their industries marketed in countries competing with similar products and services.<U+201D> Note the error in the assumption that multinational corporatists have a beneficial relationship to any country that flies their business flag. In a perverted business culture which is now based upon the <U+2018> Citizens United <U+2019> court decision that confirms previous precedents that a corporation is a person, the United States has lost the leverage to reverse the international trade practices that has clearly been the vehicle for domestic economic decline. The alternative to the surrender of sovereignty and globalist blackmail can be found in paleo-conservative populism and the economic history that built America in the 19th century. Still relevant and sound as the day it was written, Pat Buchanan on Free Trade , provides the template for a rational and constructive national economic model. <U+201C>Good for global business<U+201D> isn<U+2019>t necessarily good for US Global capitalists have become acolytes of global governance. They wish to see national sovereignty diminished and sanctions abolished. Where yesterday American businesses suffered damage to their good name for selling scrap iron to Japan before Pearl Harbor, today [war materiel is routinely exported] to potentially hostile nations. Once it was true that what was good the Fortune 500 was good for America. That is no longer true, and what is good for America must take precedence. (Source: <U+201C>A Republic, Not an Empire,<U+201D> p.349 , Oct 9, 1999) <U+201C>Economic Nationalism<U+201D>: trade only when it helps US Rather than making <U+201C>global free trade<U+201D> a golden calf which we all bow down to, and worship, all trade deals should be judged by whether: they maintain US sovereignty; they protect vital economic interests; and they ensure a rising standard of living for all our workers. We must stop sacrificing American jobs on the altars of transnational corporations whose sole loyalty is to the bottom line. <U+201C>America First<U+201D>: Tariffs; reciprocal trade; anti-dumping America<U+2019>s workers are being sacrificed to the Global Economy, and our leaders seem deaf to their distress. Impose tariffs on cheap foreign imports Prioritize the American Economy before the Global Economy by withdrawing from international organizations that imperil our financial stability & economic independence Open foreign markets to American products by requiring reciprocal trade policies Protect vital industries by passing tough anti-dumping legislation. A policy of Rational Tariffs Lower Irrational Trade Deficits is a course for a rebirth in economic vigor. Tariffs Can Restore America<U+2019>s Greatness sounds like the next topic for the Donald Trump campaign to take directly to the people. Economic Nationalism is a bipartisan issue that offers hope and practical employment for the displaced and discouraged. American companies have been punished for decades under the power elite and globalist betrayers. The Wall Street crowd despises the small investor and by inference the average hard working American. The plutocrats have built much of their ill-gotten gain on the outsourcing of an independent domestic economy. Globalism is on the precipice of a world-wide implosion. The danger is not just a planetary economic depression, but an intentional political crisis that will demand even more control and loss of access to meaningful commerce. The cries that international trade will stall to a halt will be used to economically enslave the populist further. Combat this devious strategy to stamp out the diminished vestiges of national ventures with a total rejection of the internationalist <U+201C>Free Trade<U+201D> prototype. Demand for real jobs exists now. In order to achieve the opportunity for earning a living with dignity can be accomplished under a transition to economic nationalism. The discontent of the electorate is distinctly observable at the Trump or Sanders rallies. The frustration is real and the outcry is becoming louder. Nevertheless, the road to a solution cannot rely upon a government nanny state mentality. The globalist juggernaut is formidable, as much as it is destructive. In order to implement the conversion into a merchant economy, the bulwark blockage of crony finance and fatal usury need to be broken. The start to this process begins with an awakening that globalism is the foremost enemy to America. The elites and the entire establishment are hell bent on maintaining a corrupt system.

Ms. Tsai offered Beijing a chance to reset relations after several months in which China has used its abundant economic and diplomatic sway to try to check her government<U+2019>s domestic and international agendas. She said both sides should sit down to eliminate misunderstanding, without any preconditions. <U+201C>I also hope that mainland China does not misinterpret or misjudge the current situation, or think that it can make Taiwanese bow to pressure. In a democratic society, this kind of pressure is felt by all,<U+201D> Ms. Tsai said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. <U+201C>No administration in Taiwan is able to make any decision that goes against the opinion of the people.<U+201D> Ms. Tsai also recommitted to plans to reduce Taiwan<U+2019>s economic dependence on China, saying the economies compete more than complement each other. On ties with the U.S.<U+2014>Taiwan<U+2019>s most important security partner<U+2014>Ms. Tsai expected relations to remain firm no matter whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton wins next month<U+2019>s presidential election. Ms. Tsai came to power four months ago in a landslide vote that put her party, long in opposition, in control of the legislature. The shift unsettled China and swept aside Taiwan<U+2019>s long-ruling party, whose engagement with Beijing many Taiwanese saw as benefiting the few. The prior detente had eased tensions in a recurring flashpoint since the Chinese civil war seven decades ago. Several times during the more than hourlong interview Ms. Tsai spoke about the complex relations the now full-fledged democracy has with China, which still claims the island as its territory. The 60-year-old Ms. Tsai, a former law professor and trade negotiator, chose her words carefully. She said both sides should recall her inaugural address in May when she committed to <U+201C>maximum flexibility<U+201D> by maintaining the status quo and respecting the prior administration<U+2019>s understandings with Beijing. <U+201C>The pledges we have made in the past remain unchanged. Our goodwill is unchanged. But we will not succumb to pressure from China,<U+201D> Ms. Tsai said. She said, <U+201C>We won<U+2019>t revert to the old path of conflict and confrontation.<U+201D> From the outset, however, Beijing has sent signals to rein in Ms. Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party officially supports independence for Taiwan, a stance inimical to China. Group tourism from the mainland, whose spending buoys small businesses on the island, has dipped. Beijing suspended official channels of communication with Ms. Tsai<U+2019>s government and blocked an attempt by Taiwan to participate in a global civil-aviation body. Without directly linking these measures, Beijing has conditioned engagement on Ms. Tsai<U+2019>s endorsing a vague 1992 formula her predecessor followed that there is <U+201C>one China.<U+201D> Ms. Tsai has refused to use the phrasing <U+201C><U+2019>92 consensus<U+201D> that Beijing prefers and declined to adopt it in the interview. When comparing the island<U+2019>s situation to the former British colony of Hong Kong now under Chinese rule, Ms. Tsai said Taiwan is <U+201C>a sovereign, independent country<U+201D> but, like the people of Hong Kong, aspires to <U+201C>democracy, freedom and human rights.<U+201D> A frustration for Ms. Tsai<U+2019>s government, as well as for many Taiwanese, has been Taiwan<U+2019>s relative diplomatic isolation and exclusion from many international bodies, chiefly due to Beijing<U+2019>s objections. Most recently, Taiwan was barred from last month<U+2019>s meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization after joining the rule-setting body<U+2019>s prior meeting in 2013. Ms. Tsai said her government sought to engage Beijing to permit Taiwan<U+2019>s entry. While some countries voiced their backing, she said, <U+201C>We need stronger support from the international community.<U+201D> On the South China Sea, Ms. Tsai surprised many governments in the region by rejecting an international tribunal<U+2019>s ruling in July that invalidated most of China<U+2019>s sweeping claims to the seas and land formations. Beijing rejected it as well. Taiwan controls the largest island and its claims on paper mirror Beijing<U+2019>s. Ms. Tsai explained her government<U+2019>s decision reflected in part a sense of unfairness: the tribunal excluded Taiwan and referred to its government as part of China. <U+201C>As a stakeholder, we must be part of the negotiations and be allowed to participate as other claimants,<U+201D> she said. Likewise, on the economy, Ms. Tsai said, for the sake of prosperity, Taiwan must promote innovation and shift trade and investment to Southeast Asia and South Asia, and away from China. Growth in the economy, which is roughly the size of Sweden<U+2019>s, is officially projected to reach 1.2%, and, Ms. Tsai said, was already slowing for years before she took office. <U+201C>We don<U+2019>t intend to politicize this intention to expand to other markets and economies,<U+201D> Ms. Tsai said. Asked if Chinese leaders might block agreements with other countries, she said that <U+201C>they tend to forget many of the decisions made are not that politically oriented.<U+201D> Ms. Tsai said she<U+2019>s open to meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but without conditions. After forging closer ties with Beijing, her predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang or Nationalist Party, held a landmark meeting last year with Mr. Xi, the first between leaders of the two sides since Communist forces drove the Nationalists from the mainland in 1949. <U+201C>It has been a longstanding practice of China to set political preconditions before any meaningful dialogue can be held. I think this is obstructive to the development of our relationship,<U+201D> she said. Write to Charles Hutzler at charles.hutzler@wsj.com and Jenny W. Hsu at jenny.hsu@wsj.com",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Kate Davidson \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-yellen-rate-increase-could-become-appropriate-relatively-soon-1479387604 \n text: The U.S. dollar steamed to a level not seen since 2003 and yields on the 10-year Treasury note reached a high for the year Thursday, as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen confirmed investors<U+2019> view that the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand an interest-rate rise soon. Ms. Yellen told lawmakers in testimony Thursday that the Fed could move <U+201C>relatively soon,<U+201D> after the government released a grab bag of economic data all pointing to a stronger economy: an improving housing market, rising consumer prices and a more robust labor market. <U+201C>At this stage, I do think that the economy is making very good progress toward our goals, and that the judgment the [Fed policy] committee reached in November still pertains,<U+201D> she told Congress<U+2019>s Joint Economic Committee. Her comments bolstered expectations that the Fed will lift its benchmark federal-funds rate at its next meeting on Dec. 13-14. Ms. Yellen said the results of the U.S. presidential election hadn<U+2019>t altered the central bank<U+2019>s assessment, following its meeting earlier this month, that the case for a rate increase had grown. And Thursday<U+2019>s data suggest President-elect Donald Trump is poised to take office in January at the helm of an economy that is gathering pace. U.S. consumer prices rose in October from a year earlier at the fastest rate in two years, while the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment insurance fell last week to its lowest level since 1973, the Labor Department reported Thursday. Housing starts were at their strongest pace since 2007, and permits for new construction rose in October. Ms. Yellen warned that holding off on a rate increase for too long could force the Fed to raise rates relatively abruptly in the future to keep the economy from overheating. But she said the near-term risk of <U+201C>falling behind the curve<U+201D> soon is limited, and reiterated that the bank expects to raise rates gradually over the next few years. Ms. Yellen said it isn<U+2019>t clear whether Mr. Trump<U+2019>s proposals for tax cuts and increased spending, if enacted by Congress, could alter that path in the future. Since last week, investors have been pouring money into the dollar and financial shares, and pulling money out of government bonds, with many expecting Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election would mean a more expansive fiscal policy, stronger inflation and ultimately higher U.S. interest rates. The improving economic news and Ms. Yellen<U+2019>s comments solidified that view, investors said. The numbers <U+201C>were quite striking and suggest solid growth and inflation outlooks with very low recession fear,<U+201D> said Mike Lorizio, a senior fixed-income trader at Manulife Asset Management. The ICE Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against six others, reached its highest level in more than 13 years on Thursday and is up 2.9% since the election. The gap between U.S. and German government-bond yields yawned to its widest in 27 years. The Dow industrials rose 36 points to 18904, their eighth rise in nine sessions, led by gains in financial stocks. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit 2.278% Thursday, the highest level in 2016. The U.S. yield premium over the 10-year German bund rose to 1.99 percentage points, the highest since May 1989, said Steven Zeng, interest-rate strategist at Deutsche Bank. Expectations for an interest-rate increase in December have grown in recent sessions. Fed funds futures, used by investors to bet on central-bank policy, showed a roughly 91% chance of a rate rise at the Fed<U+2019>s meeting in December, according to CME Group. Fed officials said in their Nov. 2 policy statement they only needed <U+201C>some<U+201D> further evidence of an improving economy before raising rates again. Ms. Yellen said data since the Fed<U+2019>s most recent meeting affirms officials<U+2019> expectations for stronger economic growth, an improving job market and rising inflation. Her remarks signaled they remain on track for raising their benchmark rate as soon as next month. <U+201C>Yellen<U+2019>s prepared remarks followed by strong economic data for October<U+2026>all but guarantee a December funds rate hike,<U+201D> said PNC Financial Services Group chief economist Stuart Hoffman. Ms. Yellen said it is too soon to know how the Trump administration<U+2019>s economic policies will take shape, and what their potential effect could be on employment, growth and prices. But she said the Fed will watch what Congress does next year and update its economic outlook to take those changes into account. <U+201C>Things could turn out very differently, we understand, and we will simply watch what decisions are made and factor them into our thinking going forward,<U+201D> she said. In considering the costs and benefits of fiscal policies, Ms. Yellen urged lawmakers to keep longer-term challenges in mind, including the country<U+2019>s rising ratio of debt to gross domestic product, and to remember that the economy might need stimulus measures if its runs into trouble. She also urged them to choose policies that would improve long-term productivity and economic growth. Asked if the possibility of fiscal stimulus next year could warrant a delay in raising rates, possibly until January, Ms. Yellen said: <U+201C>I would think that the judgment the committee reached in November remains the appropriate one.<U+201D> The Fed chief quashed speculation that she may leave the central bank soon after Mr. Trump takes office. Earlier this year, he called Ms. Yellen <U+201C>highly political<U+201D> and accused her of keeping interest rates low to help Democrats<U+2014>accusations she has denied. <U+201C>It is fully my intention to serve out that term,<U+201D> she said, when asked about the possibility that she might leave before her four-year term as chairwoman ends in February 2018. Fed officials decided to hold off on raising rates at their meeting earlier this month after judging that there was <U+201C>somewhat more room<U+201D> for the labor market to improve than they had expected at the beginning of the year, Ms. Yellen said. The central bank still sees <U+201C>scope for some further improvement,<U+201D> she said. Since their last meeting, Fed officials have seen several other signs of economic progress: wages rose 2.8% in October, the fastest annual pace since June 2009, and employers continued to add jobs at a steady clip. Americans boosted their spending at retail stores in October, and September sales were higher than previously estimated, marking the strongest two-month stretch of sales in at least two years. Unemployment was at a low 4.9% last month. Average monthly job growth so far this year is still well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force, Ms. Yellen said. The share of adults in the labor force<U+2014>those holding or actively seeking jobs<U+2014>has held steady this year, reflecting that the economy has had <U+201C>more room to run<U+201D> than officials had anticipated, she said. The decision to keep rates on hold this month did <U+201C>not reflect a lack of confidence in the economy,<U+201D> she said. Fed officials have left the federal-funds rate unchanged this year after raising it in December 2015 to a range between 0.25% and 0.50%. <U+2014>Eric Morath and Anna Louie Sussman contributed to this article.

Clinton had been gaining in the polls over Trump in the wake of the release of footage showing Trump talking about groping women and subsequent allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him. \nHowever, daily revelations from hacked Clinton campaign emails obtained by WikiLeaks have become a headache for the Democrat<U+2019>s campaign. The resumption of the FBI probe poses a potentially bigger problem. \nRon Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI, told Fox News in a telephone interview that retired FBI officials were <U+201C>livid<U+201D> at Comey over the fact that charges were not brought against Clinton in round one of the investigation. \n<U+201C>He lit her on fire and then walked away,<U+201D> Hosko said of Comey holding a news conference laying out Clinton<U+2019>s mishandling of classified information but then not pressing criminal charges. \nHosko said he still defends Comey for not pressing charges because the FBI always has to make a decision <U+201C>based on what they have<U+201D> at the time. Hosko said he thinks agents were probing a separate matter and found emails that made them say, <U+201C>Oh my God look at what we have.<U+201D> \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan called the FBI decision <U+201C>long overdue.<U+201D> BREAKING NEWS <U+2192> The FBI is reopening its investigation into Secretary Hillary Clinton. \nMy full statement <U+21E9> pic.twitter.com/LHfyg46dWk \n<U+2014> Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) October 28, 2016 \nBut former Obama administration spokesman Tommy Vietor chided the bureau on Twitter.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Eric Margolis \n source: ronpaulinstitute.org \n text: Written by Eric Margolis   As a former soldier and war correspondent who has covered 14 conflicts, I look at all the media hoopla over tightening siege of Mosul, Iraq and shake my head. This western-organized <U+201C>liberation<U+201D> of Mosul is one of the bigger pieces of political-military theater that I<U+2019>ve seen. Islamic State (IS), the defender of Mosul, is a paper tiger, blown out of all proportion by western media. IS is, as this writer has been saying for years, an armed mob made up of 20-something malcontents, religious fanatics, and modern-day anarchists. At its top is a cadre of former Iraqi Army officers with military experience. These former officers of Saddam Hussain are bent on revenge for the US destruction of their nation and the lynching of its late leader. But IS rank and file has no military training, little discipline, degraded communications, and ragged logistics. In fact, today<U+2019>s Islamic State is what the Ottoman Empire used to term, <U+2018>bashi-bazouks,<U+201D> a collection of irregular cut-throats and scum of the gutter sent to punish and terrorize enemies by means of torture, rapine, looting, and arson. What has amazed me about the faux western war against ISIS is its leisurely nature, lack of <U+00E9>lan , and hesitancy. In my view, ISIS was mostly created by the US and its allies as a weapon to be used against Syria<U+2019>s government <U+2013> just as the Afghan mujahadin were used by the US and the Saudis to overthrow the Soviet-backed Afghan government. Israel tried the same tactics by helping create Hamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Both were cultivated to split the PLO. ISIS is an ad hoc movement that wants to punish the West and the Saudis for the gross carnage they have inflicted on the Arab world. Western and Kurdish auxiliary forces have been sitting 1.5 hours drive from Mosul and the IS town of Raqqa for over a year. Instead, western <U+2013> mainly US <U+2013> warplanes have been gingerly bombing around these targets in what may be an effort to convince breakaway ISIS to rejoin US-led forces fight the Damascus regime. Note that ISIS does not appear to have ever attacked Israel though it is playing an important role in the destruction of Syria. Some reports say Israel is providing logistic and medical support for IS. The siege of Mosul is being played up by western media as a heroic second Stalingrad. Don<U+2019>t be fooled. IS has only 3-5,000 lightly armed fighters in Mosul and Raqqa, maybe even less. The leaders of IS are likely long gone. IS has few heavy weapons, no air cover at all, and poor communications. Its rag-tag fighters will run out of ammunitions and explosives very quickly. Encircling Mosul are at least 50,000 western-led soldiers, backed by heavy artillery, rocket batteries, tanks, armored vehicles and awesome air power The western imperial forces are composed of tough Kurdish peshmerga fighters, Iraqi army and special forces, some Syrian Kurds, Iranian <U+2018>volunteers<U+2019> irregular forces and at least 5,000 US combat troops called <U+201C>advisors<U+201D>, plus small numbers of French, Canadian and British special forces. Hovering in the background are some thousands of Turkish troops, supported by armor and artillery ready to \"liberate\" Iraq <U+2013> which was once part of the Ottoman Empire. For the US, current military operations in Syria and Iraq are the realization of an imperialist<U+2019>s fondest dream: native troops led by white officers, the model of the old British Indian Raj. Washington arms, trained, equips and financed all its native auxiliaries. The IS is caught in a dangerous dilemma. To be a political movement, it was delighted to control Iraq<U+2019>s second largest city. But as a guerilla force, it should not have holed up in an urban area where it was highly vulnerable to concentrated air attack and being surrounded. This is what<U+2019>s happening right now. In the mostly flat Fertile Crescent with too few trees, ground forces are totally vulnerable to air power, as the recent 1967, 1973 Israel-Arab wars and 2003 Iraq wars have shown. Dispersion and guerilla tactics are the only hope for those that lack air cover. IS forces would best advise to disperse across the region and continue their hit-and-run attacks. Otherwise, they risk being destroyed. But being mostly bloody-minded young fanatics, IS may not heed military logic and precedent in favor of making a last stand in the ruins of Mosul and Raqqa. When this happens, western leaders will compete to claim authorship of the faux crusade against the paper tiger of ISIS.   LewRockwell.com . Related",

The strikes, which included the use of Kaliber cruise missiles, hit the provinces of Idlib and Homs, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said at a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. <U+201C>We started a large operation to deliver massive fire strikes on ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra positions in the provinces of Idlib and Homs,<U+201D> Mr. Shoigu said, using an acronym for Islamic State. Al Nusra, a jihadist group fighting the Syrian regime, is linked to al Qaeda. Its leaders claim to have severed ties with the international terrorist organization. The latest Russian strikes didn<U+2019>t target Aleppo, Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov told Interfax. Mr. Shoigu, however, said factories used to make chemical weapons were also being targeted and destroyed. Last week, the Russian government accused U.S.-backed rebels in Aleppo of using chemical weapons , charges the rebels denied. The airstrikes are being launched from a flotilla of Russian warships off the coast of Syria, including Russia<U+2019>s sole aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov. The flotilla caused international outrage and was denied refueling in Spain . The North Atlantic Treaty Organization carefully monitored the warships along the route. Regime helicopters dropped barrel bombs on east Aleppo, killing at least three people and leaving a number of others wounded, said the U.K.-based opposition monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Warplanes also launched rockets on the area, the group said, without identifying if the planes were Russian or Syrian. Russia is a major ally of the Syrian regime. <U+201C>All the ways to reach a settlement and national reconciliation with the militants have [failed], because of the militants<U+2019> stubbornness in the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo,<U+201D> an unidentified source told the pro-government Syrian newspaper Al Watan on Monday. The Syrian government often refers to the opposition as militants. The Syrian army sent text messages to rebels<U+2019> cellphones telling them to leave Aleppo by Monday, the source said, adding that the army had moved from <U+201C>defense to attack<U+201D> positions. More than 25 airstrikes carried out by Syrian helicopters and Russian jets also hit east Aleppo, according to Sharif Alhalbi, a local activist. <U+201C>People are in a panic at the moment,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>This mad shelling came after calm days, and people weren<U+2019>t prepared. Lots of people were out this morning seeking food when [it] resumed.<U+201D> At least four towns in Idlib province were also struck by barrel bombs and ballistic missiles on Tuesday, said Ibrahim Sattouf, a resident in the province, hitting targets frequented by civilians including a school, market and fuel station. They also hit a base used by the Free Syrian Army, a rebel group backed by the U.S., in the town of Kafr Anbel, he said. The U.S. State Department condemned the resumption of strikes. <U+201C>The most recent reported attacks are on five hospitals and one mobile clinic in Syria,<U+201D> spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said Tuesday. <U+201C>We believe it<U+2019>s a violation of international law.<U+201D> Russia<U+2019>s military involvement in Syria, where it backs the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, has drawn international criticism. Mr. Putin and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump spoke by phone on Monday on a range of issues, including their common pledge to combat <U+201C>the common enemy No. 1<U+2014>international terrorism and extremism,<U+201D> the Kremlin said, adding that the resolution of the Syria crisis was also discussed. Unlike the Obama administration, Mr. Trump has taken a more conciliatory tone toward Russian intervention in Syria, saying that the U.S. should stop pursuing regime change there and focus on Islamic State. Mr. Trump has suggested that he could end U.S. military aid to moderate rebel groups saying <U+201C>we<U+2019>re backing rebels against Syria, and we have no idea who these people are.<U+201D> Though rebels have long said the U.S. only provides a small amount of military aid<U+2014>namely antitank missiles<U+2014>the weapons have played an important role in battles against both the Syrian regime and Islamic State militants. The missiles have been deployed against the regime in the ongoing battle for Aleppo city. Losing those weapons would deprive the opposition of one of the most advanced weapons in their cache. Relations between Russia and the U.S. have deteriorated over the crises in Syria and Ukraine. A Syrian cease-fire brokered by Russia and the U.S. in September fell apart days after it went into effect. Since Oct. 18, Russia said it has observed a humanitarian pause around the besieged northern city of Aleppo. <U+2014>Raja Abdulrahim and Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.",

Pat Toomey Saturday, after the Republican's campaign began airing a late ad Friday night that featured past praise from the president. The ad uses footage of an Obama statement following the failure of the 2013 Manchin-Toomey proposal to expand background checks on gun sales. Obama praised Toomey and Sen. Joe Manchin , a conservative West Virginia Democrat, for their \"courage\" in pushing the proposal. Story Continued Below Toomey's campaign hopes the ad will reinforce an image of the senator as bipartisan and independent ahead of Tuesday's election in a state Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is likely to win. But Obama has endorsed Democrat Katie McGinty in the contest <U+2014> an endorsement that has featured prominently in McGinty's own advertising this year. Obama, McGinty's campaign and national Democrats are crying foul over Toomey's use of the footage, noting the senator has overwhelmingly opposed most of Obama's agenda. \"Pat Toomey may have done the right thing on one vote, but courage is telling Pennsylvania voters where you stand on the tough issues, not just the easy ones like background checks,\" Obama said in a statement Saturday afternoon. \"Pat Toomey won't tell Pennsylvania voters where he stands on Donald Trump, trying instead to have it both ways by telling different people what he thinks they want to hear. That's not courage. Voting to shut down the government and against bills to close the terrorist gun loophole isn't courage.\" \"We had a Democrat and a Republican come together and work together to write a common-sense compromise on background checks, and I want to thank Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their courage in doing that,\" Obama says in the footage used in the Toomey ad. \"Pat Toomey fights for us.\" Congress By Rachael Bade \"Pat Toomey fights for us,\" a narrator concludes over footage of Toomey talking with a multiracial crowd. DSCC spokesman Lauren Passalacqua criticized the Toomey campaign's move. \"Senator Toomey refuses to answer questions about whether he<U+2019>ll vote Donald Trump, said just two days ago he thinks Trump will sign 'constructive' legislation and is now using a president he<U+2019>s opposed at every turn to try to save his own career,\" she said. \"This is among the most disingenuous stunts we've seen in a cycle full of them.\" The Toomey campaign saw nothing wrong with the spot. \"Pat Toomey is proud of the bipartisan work he's done to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill,\" spokesman Ted Kwong said. \"He's been praised by leaders on both sides of the aisle, including President Obama, for his efforts and we will continue to highlight that record.\" Obama will have another big opportunity to respond to the ad soon: He's expected to campaign for Clinton and McGinty at a rally Monday in Philadelphia. The McGinty campaign is also airing two different ads featuring the endorsement of first lady Michelle Obama. \"We need leaders in the Senate like Katie McGinty and other Democrats who share our values and will stand up for us on the issues that matter most <U+2014> from good jobs, to equal pay for women, to affordable health care,\" Michelle Obama says in one of the ads . Also on Saturday, an affiliate of a super PAC that works to elect Senate Democrats launched a new campaign attacking Toomey over guns <U+2014> part of a existing $800,000 campaign in the Philadelphia media market meant to neutralize what has been the focal point of Toomey<U+2019>s claim to bipartisanship. The package of three ads feature survivors and family members of victims of recent mass shootings, such as the 2012 massacre at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and the shooting of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) at a constituent event in 2011. By Edward-Isaac Dovere The ads feature Toomey<U+2019>s opposition to an assault weapons ban and banning high capacity ammunition clips. One ad features Patricia Maisch, who wrestled the clip away from Giffords shooter Jared Loughner during the 2011 shooting. <U+201C>I wish Pat Toomey could have seen firsthand how gun violence destroys lives,<U+201D> Maisch says in the ad. <U+201C>Instead, Toomey opposes a ban on assault weapons, and opposes banning high capacity ammo clips. We need real leaders to stop gun violence. That<U+2019>s not Pat Toomey.<U+201D> <U+201C>When push comes to shove, Pat Toomey stands with the gun lobby in opposition to commonsense measures to keep people safe,<U+201D> said Shripal Shah, spokesman for Majority Forward, an affiliate of Senate Majority PAC. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re going to make sure that Pennsylvania voters know the truth about his record.<U+201D> Earlier this year, the White House called for a super PAC backing Democratic Rep. Donna Edwards ' Senate bid to take down an ad that used footage of Obama discussing the massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. The ad was attacking Rep. Chris Van Hollen , who went on to win the primary. By Michael Grunwald By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz",

        "input": "time: null \n author: Daniel Henninger \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-a-team-1480551204 \n text: The day before Thanksgiving in New York, I bumped into a Trump adviser who actually knows what is going on inside Trump Tower, as opposed to rumors inhabiting the media such as this Tuesday headline: <U+201C>Trump<U+2019>s Team Frays Over Romney.<U+201D> The message I got was different: <U+201C>It<U+2019>s going to be fine. It<U+2019>s going to be just fine.<U+201D> In the seven days since Thanksgiving, President-elect Trump has named the respected schools reformer Betsy DeVos from Michigan as Secretary of Education. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and a committed reformer of ObamaCare, is Secretary of Health and Human Services. Elaine Chao, who was George W. Bush <U+2019>s reformist Labor Secretary for eight years, is the new Secretary of Transportation. Two businessmen will enter the cabinet. Former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin is Treasury Secretary and Wilbur Ross, an investor in distressed industries, will be Commerce Secretary. Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, one of the most able officers to serve in Iraq and later head of the U.S. Central Command, is within a hair of being Secretary of Defense. Going deeper into the policy weeds, Mr. Trump selected Indiana Medicaid reformer Seema Verma to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. The main Supreme Court adviser visiting Trump Tower has been Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society. Bob Woodson, one of this generation<U+2019>s smartest and most productive black conservatives, has been in to discuss with Mr. Trump how to make good on his campaign promise to champion the inner cities. If instead of these individuals, the visitors to Trump Tower had been the alt-right activists of so many progressive night sweats, it would have been reported across the New York Times <U+2019> front page and on CNN round the clock, as if Godzilla and Mothra were trundling up Fifth Avenue. Instead, the Trump transition has been talking to and appointing some of the most accomplished and serious individuals in Republican and conservative politics. Donald Trump isn<U+2019>t pulling rabbits out of a hat. Somebody at team Trump has a first-rate Rolodex. By now, it should be obvious that the Trump operation exists in two parts. One half is the operation<U+2019>s face, Donald Trump. The other half is the operation behind the face. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s persona has often made it difficult to take the entire Trump phenomenon seriously. That, we learned, is a mistake. Months ago, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s small team got hold of what is essentially a transition textbook<U+2014><U+201C>Presidential Transition Guide<U+201D> published earlier this year by the Partnership for Public Service. Its contributors worked on pre-election transitions for John McCain, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama. The Trump preparatory group began to come together in Washington last spring. In fact, both the Trump and Clinton transition teams were in the same building at 1717 Pennsylvania Avenue, a few blocks from the White House. Hillary<U+2019>s people were on the 17th floor and the Trump planners were on the eighth. They rode the elevators together<U+2014>and understood that one of them would fold up shop. Life is full of surprises. This Trump transition operation is filled with specialists and veterans extending back to Ronald Reagan<U+2019>s transition, such as Ed Meese. While New York conducts auditions for the cabinet<U+2019>s speaking parts, the Washington policy shop is now recruiting the under-, deputy- and assistant secretaryships. I<U+2019>m told calls are arriving from solid people in the private sector who want to work on the Trump project, without pay, and then get out. That is the private-to-public expertise model created by Gov. Mitch Daniels in Indiana and followed by Govs. John Kasich in Ohio and Bill Haslam in Tennessee. Presumably this is the intention in naming Messrs. Mnuchin and Ross. I would have preferred seeing House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling get Treasury, on the assumption that his ability to get tax reform and the overhaul of Dodd-Frank through Congress would have all but guaranteed a revived economy and a successful first Trump term. Mr. Mnuchin will benefit from having Chairman Hensarling as a lodestar in the House. If Mr. Trump<U+2019>s foreign-policy goal is to <U+201C>kill ISIS,<U+201D> it would be hard to design a more effective partnership than Jim Mattis at Defense and David Petraeus at State. They know what to do and how to do it, but that<U+2019>s not the most important thing. As former commanders in Iraq, Gens. Mattis and Petraeus have seen enough sacrifice from American troops in the Middle East for two lifetimes. These are men who will not argue for committing ground troops unless the U.S. is going to win and then secure the durability of its dear investment there. As for Kellyanne Conway<U+2019>s supposed anti-Romney rampage Sunday morning, I<U+2019>m more inclined to see it as Thomas Cromwell going on television to explain the requirements of loyalty to Henry VIII<U+2019>s associates.

The ones who just so happen to sit nicely within the camera frame? They are always something of a fantasy construct. If a candidate has a problem with women voters, then the podium behind will be packed tightly with women. If some number cruncher decides that Black men would rather vote for someone else, then they too get press-ganged into the formation of a human canvas. A little bit of demographic sleight of hand if you will. \nIt<U+2019>s no big deal. They all do it. It<U+2019>s a talking point, a visual cue for the doubters and a psychological nudge for the undecided. Any Color You Want So Long As It<U+2019>s White \nOf course, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has a problem with pretty much every non-white male demographic you can think of. And when it comes to Black voters, his poll numbers are so low that misrepresenting his demographic base is all but impossible. No matter how large your crowd is, a statistical zero still leaves you with a chronic shortage of Black people.

Go figure. \nAs a former high-ranking member of the Nation of Yahweh <U+2014> a violent black supremacist organization <U+2014> he has good reason to keep his true name secret. The cult disintegrated in the 1980s shortly after its leader, Yahweh ben Yahweh , was arrested on conspiracy charges relating to 14 murders committed in Miami. Yahweh was convicted and eventually served 11 years of an 18-year sentence before his death in 2007. \nMichael has had his share of legal problems too. \nImplicated, but never convicted of two separate murders, he has since been charged with <U+2014> though again, never convicted <U+2014> of four separate felonies since the cult crashed and burned. \nAnd according to the New Miami Times , Michael still cuts something of a radical figure. They describes him as being : <U+201C>An anti-gay, anti-liberal preacher with a golden instinct for getting on TV at GOP events.<U+201D> \nAnd just like that, all of a sudden, his support for Trump begins to make a lot of sense. \nWatch Michael<U+2019>s enthusiasm for fellow nut-job Donald J.

Vogel Hadas Gold Jack Shafer \n source: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/democrats-electoral-college-faithless-trump-231731 \n text: At least a half-dozen Democratic electors have signed onto an attempt to block Donald Trump from winning an Electoral College majority, an effort designed not only to deny Trump the presidency but also to undermine the legitimacy of the institution. The presidential electors, mostly former Bernie Sanders supporters who hail from Washington state and Colorado, are now lobbying their Republican counterparts in other states to reject their oaths <U+2014> and in some cases, state law <U+2014> to vote against Trump when the Electoral College meets on Dec. 19. Story Continued Below Even the most optimistic among the Democratic electors acknowledges they're unlikely to persuade the necessary 37 Republican electors to reject Trump <U+2014> the number they'd likely need to deny him the presidency and send the final decision to the House of Representatives. And even if they do, the Republican-run House might simply elect Trump anyway. But the Democratic electors are convinced that even in defeat, their efforts would erode confidence in the Electoral College and fuel efforts to eliminate it, ending the body<U+2019>s 228-year run as the only official constitutional process for electing the president. With that goal in mind, the group is also contemplating encouraging Democratic electors to oppose Hillary Clinton and partner with Republicans in support of a consensus pick like Mitt Romney or John Kasich. By Yousef Saba The underlying idea is that a mass defection of electors could provide the impetus for a wave of changes to the Electoral College. \"I do think that a byproduct would be a serious look into Electoral College reform,\" said Micheal Baca, a Democratic elector from Colorado who is spearheading the anti-Trump effort, along with Washington state elector P. Bret Chiafalo. \"If it gets into the House, the controversy and the uncertainty that would immediately blow up into a political firestorm in the U.S. would cause enough people <U+2014> my hope is <U+2014> to look at the whole concept of the Electoral College,\" said another elector involved in the anti-Trump planning, who declined to be identified. One prominent Electoral College critic says that even if Trump wins easily on Dec. 19, a small number of Republican defections could still roil the future of the institution. \"If you could get eight or 10 Trump electors to vote for someone else ... then that would probably get people's attention,\" said George Edwards III, a political science professor and Electoral College expert at Texas A&M University. \"We haven't ever had that many faithless electors in one election.\" Democratic elector Polly Baca (no relation to Micheal) said the Electoral College should be returned to its original conception <U+2014> as laid out by Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers <U+2014> as a deliberative body able to exercise free choice while using popular votes only as a guide. Presidential Transition By Kenneth P. Vogel \"If we cannot use the Electoral College as a deliberative process ... then we ought to do away with it,\" said Baca, a former co-chairman of the Democratic National Convention and former Colorado state senator. The 538 members who comprise the Electoral College are slated to gather in their respective state capitals on Dec. 19 to cast the formal vote for president. Trump won the popular vote in states making up 290 electoral votes <U+2014> and he<U+2019>s leading narrowly in Michigan, which carries another 16 electoral votes. If all of them vote for Trump, he<U+2019>ll win 306 electoral votes, easily exceeding the 270-vote majority he needs to become president. That's why the magic number is 37 Republican defections. Dozens of Republican electors, picked at state and local party conventions, have signaled discomfort with Trump, but most have committed to supporting him despite their misgivings. Only a handful have said they'd consider voting against him in the Electoral College. One, Texas' Art Sisneros, said he's still making up his mind. South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard, another elector, called on Trump to withdraw from the race after a tape of his comments about sexually assaulting women leaked in October. But he's since confirmed he'd still support Trump with his electoral vote. A slew of Democrats, on the other hand, have also signaled they may defect from Clinton, which wouldn't help or hinder Trump's path to the White House but could contribute to a sense of disarray and voter disenfranchisement. In any case, it's hard to know exactly how many faithless electors may be out there because there's no organized effort by candidates or parties to whip votes or track support. Presidential Transition By Kenneth P. Vogel Polly Baca, who's still considering whether to cast her vote against Clinton, said that she'll decide in part based on whether there's a strategic consensus reached with other Democrats to vote for another candidate. Already, the six Democrats prepared to be \"faithless\" electors would be the most to defect from their party's presidential candidate since 1872 , when Democratic nominee Horace Greeley died before electors cast their votes. The last time that many electors rejected a living presidential candidate was 1808 . Robert Nemanich, another Colorado elector prepared to cast a faithless vote, said he's spoken to five electors in his state alone who intend to join him. The rarity of the faithless elector phenomenon is rooted in electors<U+2019> reluctance to reject the will of the voters. But it<U+2019>s also because 29 states <U+2014> including Colorado and Washington <U+2014> have laws mandating that electors support the winner of the state popular vote. These laws, though, have never been enforced or challenged. And some of them impose only modest fines but provide no recourse to change the outcome. By Hadas Gold In recent elections, the Electoral College has become an increasingly vexing issue for Democrats, who won the popular vote in 2000, only to see George W. Bush take the White House because of the electoral vote math. Should the college vote for Trump, as expected, it'll be the same story: Clinton led the popular vote by about 1.7 million votes as of Monday morning. To repeal the Electoral College outright would require a constitutional amendment <U+2014> and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) conveniently proposed one last week. But it's unlikely to advance in a Republican-controlled Congress. Another measure, a multistate compact already enacted in 11 states, would require electors to support the winner of the national popular vote. But that would take effect only if enough states join to comprise a majority of the Electoral College. So far, the 11 signatory states <U+2014> all solidly Democratic <U+2014> make up just 165 electoral votes. Ironically, Democrats have taken heart from Trump<U+2019>s own statements regarding the Electoral College. In the past, the president-elect has called the body a \" disaster for democracy .\" In 2012, he urged supporters to march on Washington when he believed Mitt Romney had won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College. His views haven<U+2019>t changed. In a recent, post-election interview with \"60 Minutes,\" he said, \"I would rather see it where you went with simple votes.\" By Bill Scher By Joshua Zeitz By Thomas Wright By Jack Shafer",

Message: here<U+2019>s the US making provisions for Philippine defense at the same time Duterte<U+2019>s selling out the country to China. \nTo me, the inadvertent message was 1) here<U+2019>s the US blindly stroking the pivot fetish while Duterte tries to solve the Mindanao insurgency that has cost at least 400,000 lives over the last century, win his drug war, and find a place for the Philippines in Asia that doesn<U+2019>t give primacy to the US preoccupation confronting the PRC and 2) the U.S., in my opinion, pretty much has a policy of keeping the Philippines flat on its behind as an independent military force by trickling out second-hand gear to the Philippine military while the sweet stuff is dangled in front of it during US joint military maneuvers and port calls. \nBut the United States is trying to find political leverage wherever it can and the Western media will, I<U+2019>m sure, put its shoulder to the wheel to help out. \nPhilip Goldberg sat down for a 45-minute exit interview with Rappler. As befitting Rappler<U+2019>s origins in the Soros/Omidyar network of pro-US globalization advocacy, the interview was a stream of softballs about what to do about Duterte<U+2019>s disregard of the awesomeness of the American relationship, an awesomeness that is acknowledged by virtually all Filipinos who inexplicably (and, if the US has anything to do about it, temporarily) at the same time give Duterte approval ratings of over 80%. \nIt<U+2019>s worth watching if you have the patience. Goldberg is a smooth cat, and the Rappler tonguebath gives you no inkling of the fact that he intimately familiar with the wet work of end-arounding national governments to cultivate secessionist movements, you know, like what he did in Bolivia (declared persona non grata as a result) and Kosovo, and like that thing in Duterte<U+2019>s home province of Mindanao, which in my opinion probably the main reason why Duterte wanted him out of the Philippines. \nGoldberg also discretely plays the economic threat card, concern-trolling that anti-US attitudes will dismay <U+201C>foreign investors<U+201D>. \nIt will be interesting to see how this plays out in subsequent weeks. As far as I can tell, the biggest U.S. factor in the domestic Philippine economy is the call-center industry. I doubt US corporations are interested in actually pulling their operations out and subjecting them to the English-language mercies of India, but certainly a call from the State Department or White House would convince them of the wisdom of at least making the threat. \nAnd I also wonder if expected President Hillary Clinton will find it necessary to drop the hammer on Duterte, in order to demonstrate to a rather dubious Asia that there is no alternative to loyalty to the pivot. \nI expect the next few months, in other words, to be very interesting.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/rudolph-giuliani-on-trumps-immediate-agenda-1479784621 \n text: Rudolph Giuliani has had an extensive career, but he is perhaps best known for leading New York City to recovery after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Now he<U+2019>s a prominent member of President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s transition team and emerged after the election as one of the top contenders for the post of secretary of state. The Wall Street Journal<U+2019>s Gerard Baker spoke with Mr. Giuliani about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s positions and plans. What follows are edited excerpts of the conversation. MR. BAKER: Give us your sense of what the immediate agenda is for the Trump presidency. MR. GIULIANI: You<U+2019>re going to see very much the policies he talked about. I analogize this election to when Andrew Jackson defeated what was the almost emerging nobility of America. The American people had had enough of this elite, we needed somebody who represented us. That<U+2019>s what happened here. The people revolted against the elite that was trying to force on them policies they didn<U+2019>t agree with or didn<U+2019>t address what they were concerned about. Trump has to deliver on securing the borders. He has to lower taxes on everybody, so everybody gets a little bit more money in their pocket. And he has to lower the corporate tax, which could be one of the biggest things he can do to ignite our economy. He has to work on repatriation of money. You do that, and you<U+2019>re going to see an economy that<U+2019>s growing at numbers where we can sustain a lot of the other things that we have to do. On trade, part of it could be the rhetoric of a campaign. Part of it can be the misinterpretation of the media. You<U+2019>re not talking about a man who<U+2019>s against free trade. You<U+2019>re talking about a man who<U+2019>s against unfair deals. MR. BAKER: The two first appointments for the administration were Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon. Bannon is an aggressive populist flamethrower. Reince Priebus is a much more traditional conservative Republican. Who<U+2019>s going to win that fight? MR. GIULIANI: Donald Trump. Donald Trump is an extraordinarily smart man. Exposing him to different viewpoints is the very best thing we can do. It<U+2019>s exactly what Obama didn<U+2019>t do, although he said he was going to do it. MR. BAKER: Let me talk about Steve Bannon. There has been a lot of concern about some of the things that he<U+2019>s associated with. He has been accused of racism. He has been accused of anti-Semitism. MR. GIULIANI: I haven<U+2019>t seen any of that in Steve. I<U+2019>ve seen a very smart, very bright man, very worldly man. I also think something happens to you when the election<U+2019>s over. It<U+2019>s not that you change your positions. But you begin to realize, <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve got to bring in more people. I<U+2019>ve got to broaden my horizons.<U+201D> I don<U+2019>t think that just happens to the president. I think that happens to the chief of staff, the policy adviser, the communications director, secretary of defense, attorney general, secretary of state. When you<U+2019>re out there just criticizing, it<U+2019>s one thing. When you actually get on the inside, there<U+2019>s a certain weight of responsibility for the American people that is on your shoulders. Steve Bannon is the kind of guy who gets that. MR. BAKER: That change you talk about, have you seen that in Donald Trump in the last week? MR. GIULIANI: From the moment he went to see Barack Obama, the way in which they dealt with each other, the way in which he<U+2019>s conducting himself, his attempt to try, as best he can, to bring America together. All these protests, I think they<U+2019>re going to go away. They<U+2019>re just going to happen for a while, because some people are disappointed, and they<U+2019>re angry. A little bit is Soros funded and driven. But I think that<U+2019>s going to go away. And what we<U+2019>re going to find is a much more worldly and expansive president than we ever realized we were electing. MR. BAKER: Is this going to be an administration that is going to take on big business issues? Are big mergers going to be opposed by the Trump administration? MR. GIULIANI: I won<U+2019>t be attorney general. So I won<U+2019>t have to decide. I don<U+2019>t know who<U+2019>s going to be attorney general. I think you<U+2019>ll see a conservative approach to antitrust law. If it<U+2019>s predatory pricing, where there are alternatives, you<U+2019>ll probably see a challenge to it. If it<U+2019>s a situation in which there<U+2019>s no alternative but a large conglomerate, I think you<U+2019>ll see the Justice Department passing on that. The last thing in the world you<U+2019>re going to see is an antibusiness administration. Donald Trump realizes that he got elected, to a very large extent, on something he said in so many speeches: <U+201C>Jobs, jobs, jobs.<U+201D> So being pro-business is being pro-jobs. That doesn<U+2019>t mean there won<U+2019>t be a necessary level of regulation. But one thing that President-elect Trump told me, he said, <U+201C>One of the things I learned over running for president, when I began, I thought the biggest concern that businesses had was taxes. It<U+2019>s true they are concerned about taxes. But they tell me their biggest concern is regulation. I<U+2019>m going to cut those damn regulations in half.<U+201D> MR. BAKER: During the campaign, President-elect Trump said that he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate and possibly prosecute Hillary Clinton. Is he going to? MR. GIULIANI: That<U+2019>s a decision he should make when he appoints an attorney general. The attorney general should sit down and study it and give him a very reasoned balance of two things. One is the idea that we don<U+2019>t want to become a country where we have political vindictiveness after an election. Number two, we don<U+2019>t want to be a country of unequal protection of the law. If the attorney general decides that they<U+2019>re not that far beyond the pale, maybe we just put it behind us. If the attorney general decides that they have to be investigated, then it shouldn<U+2019>t be Donald Trump<U+2019>s attorney general, it should be an independent counsel who investigates it. MR. BAKER: President-Elect Trump said the Iran deal that President Obama struck was a disaster. What would you do about that? MR. GIULIANI: The president has a lot of options. Because President Obama didn<U+2019>t do what he should<U+2019>ve done under the Constitution. He should<U+2019>ve submitted that to the United States Senate. The next president can disavow it as a matter of law. Either he should, or he should use that power to renegotiate it. Write to reports@wsj.com",

Mohmand on October 30, 2016 \n<U+201C>SEARCH FOR THE AFGHAN GIRL<U+201D><U+00A9> Steve McCurry \nI am writing on behalf of the Afghan villagers like Sharbat Gula because the U. S. installed Afghan administration only works on behalf of the occupiers and war profiteers. The Afghan administration does not care about Sharbat Gula. \nShame on you Pakistan for imprisoning the national Afghan war hero, Sharbat Gula , who is again suffering because of the foreign occupier<U+2019>s and its Afghan puppets<U+2019> bombardment of her village in Afghanistan. Sharbat Gula is now suffering at the greedy hands of Pakistan, who financially benefits from the U.S. war against the Afghans/Pashtun. \nIn the 1980s, her young face on the cover of National Geographic embodied the strength, dignity and honor of the Afghan Pashtun women, who suffered for a decade at the hands of the Soviet invaders and Afghan communist puppets. \nDuring both wars, Pakistan has profited from the Afghans<U+2019> suffering. After 9/11, the National Geographic editor/photographer located Sharbat Gula. He told her a lot of money had been made from the edition with her cover and what did she want. She did not want money. Sharbat Gula only wanted an education for her children and no bombardment of her village. She wanted education and peace without foreign invasion. \nHer village has been bombarded by the U.S. and its puppets, her village<U+2019>s water poisoned and her family has had to flee to Pakistan. Instead of honoring her, Pakistan imprisons her for not having the right papers. Also Pakistan punishes the Afghan Pashtun refugees because the Afghan Freedom fighters do not want Pakistan involved in peace negotiations. . The Afghan Freedom Fighters d o not want a repeat of the mistakes that occurred in the 1980s when Pakistan was involved in the peace talks between the Soviet Union and the Afghan Resistance. \nSharbat Gula is again the face of the Afghan Pashtun women,. Despite the indignities of war, she keeps her honor and dignity. \nPakistan needs to release her immediately. Perpetrators of war crimes committed against the Afghan Pashtun women need to be prosecuted and stopped. She is a victim. Sharbat Gula has human rights. The illegal war in Afghanistan must end now. Sharbat Gula has the right to live with dignity and security in her village in Afghanistan. She does not want to be forced to live in Pakistan. Enough of these greedy profiteers and this ugly war scape goating honorable Afghan Pashtun women like Sharbat Gula, who are the true national heroes. Sharbat Gula is an Afghan National Hero and not a criminal. The war criminals and war profiteers need to be imprisoned and not her. Free her now. \nSincerely,",

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: opednews.com \n text: License DMCA Racism is generally thought of as discriminating against any group of people because of certain distinctive physical features they have in common. The barren shallowness of this definition is itself actually characteristic of the 'consciousness' of people who engage in racist attitude and orientation. To find the real roots of racism we have to go down to the level of culture formation itself. It is here that what we call racism becomes inevitable. Racism does not exist merely as a flaw in cultural formation. It is an innate feature of culture formation because of what culture has always historically shown itself to be. All culture formation begins in the response of awareness to reality as experienced through the filter of this particular awareness. Everything we know about human pre-history and history tells us that fear plays a radical role in culture formation. The very fact that culture formation is a group response rather than being characterizes by any significant degree of individuality supports this thesis. The group forms as a means of protection against real possibilities of danger. Reality is perceived as dangerous, or at least as presenting possibilities of danger. And ultimately reality means the apparently inescapable mystery of mortality, which is anything but welcome and non-threatening. - Advertisement - The group forms as a means of protection and as the group develops, its group identity begins to form the rudiments of culture. This culture identity has fear as part of its elementary constitution. And the primary means of countering the threats this fear perceives is to find and develop features of reality that affirm the group identity. This involves both finding actual features in and projecting desired features onto reality. And the primary projection always involves seeing reality as having a face that affirms and reflects the face of the group itself. And this absolutely includes affirmation of the physical characteristics of the group. These physical characteristics become inseparable from the entire cultural panoply. This does not mean that culture is simply fantasy. But the fact that there are real elements in any culture only fortifies the fantasy elements and makes them indistinguishable from the real. The iconic imagery of all cultures shows the superhuman higher powers as having features that precisely reflect the features of the human group that develops this imagery. This is not merely coincidental or accidental. It shows that the human group has a fear-based emotional need to believe its particular features, which are subject to mortality, are, in spite of this fact, the features of truth . Truth becomes the protective shield of the distinctively featured group. And it must be kept in mind that this Truth is Absolute Truth (God) and therefore gives an Absolute value to the features of the group. So any human feature or behavior that varies from this group-truth is seen as at least potentially threatening and dangerous and can easily be seen as evil . But wherever it falls in the spectrum of evaluation, it is always alien and suspect because it challenges the group-truth-identity with existential fear at its foundation. The fact that aspects of culture such as art and religion can bring a joy to the people of a particular culture does not nullify anything I have said. And it also does not mean that these aspects are of no real value. But it does reveal the fact that even these aspects are of limited reality-value. And this limit is exposed by the existence of other humans who have developed a clearly different culture. The problem of racism is precisely the problem of how humans develop the Reality-Truth picture that sustains them as a group. Paranoid fear of a person or group with different physical and psychological-orientation features is not just arrogance. It involves an existential fear of identity dissolution and it reflects the failure to adequately deal with this fear in human history. Some degree of racism exists wherever culture exists. The idea that racism is a feature of exclusively any one group of people is ludicrous and very dangerous. It's all about human fear-constriction and the human desire for power over what is frightening in reality rather than expanding further into reality and keeping an open-ended identity. It is the result of partial human identity development pretending to be absolute and finished. To end racism means to end desperate attachment to dangerously undeveloped identity. It means consciousness expansion to a depth that reveals all culture as relative in truth-value and all humans as transitional forms in evolutionary movement. We are all racist because we are all afraid of reality and its evolutionary movement. The solution to this is not the development of black culture, or white culture, or yellow culture... The solution is the development of a fearless open-ended human culture and such a culture does not yet exist anywhere on the earth. Until it does humanity is in danger of self-destruction. In the present context of American society there is no ready solution to racial discrimination because there are no social structures that feed the consciousness expansion required. This oligarchic society is the death-cold pyramid of human fear of reality that feeds the forces of exploitation, abuse, and neglect. It induces pathological behavior from the top of the pyramid to the bottom. The solution to the rabid discrimination against Native Americans and African Americans at the bottom of the pyramid is not the popularizing of Native-American or African-American culture that just ends up as pulp for the amoral capitalist machine in the form of decadent and feckless entertainment. The solution is the creation of a human culture that is genuinely open to everyone because it encompasses all human experience and response. There is no other solution. However politically incorrect it might be, there is no other solution. - Advertisement -",

Gross domestic product expanded at an annualized 2.2% pace in the three months through September, the government said Monday, higher than the 0.9% rise expected by economists. It was the longest stretch of growth since 2013. The surprise was driven by a rebound in exports, which rose 2% compared with the previous quarter. Shipments of smartphone components including semiconductors rose, according to the Cabinet Office. Domestic indicators told a different story. Both household spending and capital investment, which together account for roughly 70% of GDP, were flat on quarter, despite efforts by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to get companies to spend more of their cash piles. <U+201C>The Abe government has been trying to achieve domestic-led growth, but the third quarter GDP shows that the growth is reliant on exports,<U+201D> said Shunsuke Kobayashi, economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research. Mr. Abe has tried to lift growth with a combination of monetary and fiscal stimulus since taking power in late 2012, but growth has since been uneven. He recently introduced a new package of government spending and other stimulus measures. Economists say that households are still hesitant to spend because many workers haven<U+2019>t seen significant pay increases. Fast Retailing Co., the operator of Uniqlo clothing stores, said last month that profits improved in the six months through Aug. 31 after it held off raising prices. Upscale department stores have seen sales fall in recent months as consumers put off luxury purchases. Businesses likewise held back from spending as a stronger yen weighed on repatriated profits. Among the brighter spots were private housing investment, which rose 2.3% compared with the previous quarter, and a continuing rise in tourism. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has expressed opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade deal , one of Mr. Abe<U+2019>s main initiatives to lift Japanese exports. <U+201C>The government should take steps to ensure the growth in exports will persist. With the election of Trump as president, the TPP has become difficult, but there are other free trade initiatives Japan can push forward,<U+201D> said Daiwa Institute of Research<U+2019>s Mr. Kobayashi. Japan<U+2019>s economy is expected to continue its gradual recovery, said economy minister Nobuteru Ishihara in a statement Monday, citing <U+201C>improvements in employment and wage conditions.<U+201D> Toru Suehiro, economist at Mizuho Securities, said the government would likely hold off from seeking further stimulus after a third straight quarter of expansion and the recent fall in the yen, which helps Japanese exporters. <U+201C>Since the U.S. presidential election, the upward pressure on the yen has receded. This must have helped ease the worries of the government,<U+201D> Mr. Suehiro said. Write to Eleanor Warnock at eleanor.warnock@wsj.com and Mitsuru Obe at mitsuru.obe@wsj.com",

The verdict of investors isn<U+2019>t just clear, but comes with a remarkable degree of certainty: more inflation, a little more growth, and no nasties such as a damaging trade war or a diplomatic disaster. Such certainty ought to worry those thinking of buying in to the idea of a Trumpian reflation of the U.S. economy . The boost from a market-friendly president-elect may run a while yet if Mr. Trump fills out his transition team with mainstream Republicans, to follow the weekend appointment as chief of staff of Reince Priebus . The danger is that markets already have run too far, too fast, and are increasingly vulnerable to any slip as a result. Consider one of the most extreme moves<U+2014>that of the 30-year Treasury. An investor who held on to her long bonds lost 6.6%<U+00A0>in three days, the worst performance in data stretching back to 1989. Don<U+2019>t get me wrong, the direction of the move makes perfect sense. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s transition team<U+2019>s unfunded pledge<U+00A0>to spend $550 billion on infrastructure would boost borrowing and, by creating jobs at a time of near-full employment, contribute to inflation. Add in big tax cuts for the rich, and it is easy to see why investors increasingly think three decades of falling bond yields may be over . Bonds are less attractive with the prospect of more borrowing and more spending, which means lower prices and higher yields. But the key word is <U+201C>prospect.<U+201D> Consider just the infrastructure program. There is no word from Team Trump on how swiftly that money will be spent, but it will surely be spread over many years. A pre-election plan from two of his advisers suggested $1 trillion over 10 years, but with only $137 billion of government money in the form of tax breaks for private investors. Looking on the bright side and assuming all that is new money, that would mean $100 billion of extra infrastructure spending each year, an increase of a bit less than 25% of what federal and state governments spend each year on transport and water infrastructure alone. Anyone who has driven around the U.S. knows the money is desperately needed, but $100 billion amounts to only 0.5% of GDP a year. Investors who are less hopeful might assume that a lot of this spending would have happened anyway. Even without being cynical, a look at the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 shows that spending infrastructure money quickly is hard: More than a year<U+00A0>into President Barack Obama <U+2019>s stimulus , less than one-third of the money allocated for transport infrastructure had been paid out. As Mr. Obama admitted<U+00A0>to the New York Times in 2010, <U+201C>there<U+2019>s no such thing as shovel-ready projects.<U+201D> Staying positive, perhaps a president with a history of building towers, casinos and golf courses can quickly funnel money into the right roads in the right places. Maybe a real-estate mogul can get shovels into the ground more quickly than a civil-rights lawyer, but it won<U+2019>t be instant. All of this, of course, assumes Congress passes a new spending bill and tax cuts swiftly after Mr. Trump takes office on<U+00A0>Jan. 20. And even then the markets seem to be assuming a lot. Consider just some of the price shifts since the election. Shares in companies that should benefit from infrastructure spending have soared. U.S. Steel is up more than 30%, the price of copper leapt around 6% and the FTSE USA construction and materials sector had its biggest two-day jump since the Obama stimulus spending was getting under way in April 2009. Markets could still get a lot farther ahead of themselves, as traders who missed out try to join in. Investors have made a bigger bet on inflation than growth; inflation-linked 10-year TIPS yields leapt Monday to 0.405%, but are up by much less than ordinary Treasury yields and still half what they were at the start of the year. The rest of the Trump trade is already stretched, though. Moves based on hope are particularly vulnerable to any sign that they might be wrong, and the bigger the move, the more vulnerable they become. This has been a really big move in a very short time, and the risk is growing that comments by Mr. Trump will be taken badly by investors. A 10-year Treasury yield of 2.224% may not be appealing to hold for the long term, but it is the highest this year and would provide a handy cushion when, and if, hopes of a Trump boom take a hit.

Securing the border, he said, is a prerequisite for any other action on immigration. The Manhattan billionaire<U+2019>s stance on the issue of immigration evolved throughout his candidacy. He kicked off his ultimately victorious campaign with a rally at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where he took a hard-line stance on immigration, labeling undocumented immigrants as rapists, drug dealers and criminals, adding that <U+201C>some, I assume, are good people.<U+201D> During the GOP primary, he pledged to deport every single undocumented immigrant currently in the country and said he would create a deportation force to accomplish that goal.

He shifted from a promise to deport all undocumented immigrants to the position he took with <U+201C>60 Minutes,<U+201D> to first remove those with criminal records and only then to figure out what to do with those who remain. By Louis Nelson One unchanged part of his immigration platform has been his plan for the construction of a wall along America<U+2019>s southern border with Mexico, something he said he would force the Mexican government to pay for by threatening to cut off the flow of money from immigrants to their families south of the border. Trump said Sunday that while an actual wall will be necessary along some portions of the border, a mere fence will suffice in others. <U+201C>I'm very good at this; it's called construction,<U+201D> he said.

The Clinton campaign is also sending its top surrogates to Michigan. Former President Bill Clinton, the candidate<U+2019>s husband, is set to campaign in Lansing on Sunday and President Barack Obama is scheduled to hold a rally in Ann Arbor, home to the University of Michigan, on Monday. The campaign is now running paid TV ads in Michigan as well. VIEW Interactive Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has consistently led the race in Michigan in public polling. But rival Donald Trump is making a play there , partly because putting together the 270 electoral votes he needs to win the White House will be very difficult unless he picks off at least one Democratic stronghold. An average of Michigan polls on the Real Clear Politics website shows Mrs. Clinton up by 5 percentage points , but Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said the race appears to be closing. <U+201C>The numbers there have tightened,<U+201D> he said. He said he considered Michigan to be a <U+201C>battleground state.<U+201D> The Clinton campaign<U+2019>s calculations are similar in Pennsylvania, another longtime Democratic stronghold for which Mr. Trump is making a play. Mrs. Clinton was in Pittsburgh on Friday, and returned to the state for a get-out-the-vote concert with pop star Katy Perry on Saturday night in Philadelphia. She is scheduled to make stops in the city Sunday morning, possibly to church services, and plans to return Monday for a rally with her husband, Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle. The polling average for Pennsylvania on the Real Clear Politics website shows Mrs. Clinton with a small lead<U+2014> just under 3 percentage points . But she has been ahead in virtually every survey taken since early July. Mr. Mook said much of their attention to Michigan, as well as Pennsylvania, stems from the fact that neither state has much early voting ahead of Election Day, meaning the campaign has to motivate virtually all of its supporters to the polls at once. But it is clear that Mr. Trump has greater appeal than a typical Republican in these states, which are home to many of the working-class white voters who make up his base of support . <U+201C>We have seen tightening in the Midwest generally this cycle, and we<U+2019>re taking that seriously,<U+201D> Mr. Mook said. Michelle Deatrick, who worked on Sen. Bernie Sanders <U+2019>s Michigan campaign in the Democratic primary and is now backing Mrs. Clinton, said she has done extensive neighborhood canvassing in Washtenaw County, in which Ann Arbor is located and where she is a candidate for commissioner. She said she has found little enthusiasm for either Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump when she knocks on voters<U+2019> doors. <U+201C>People are not excited about either of their choices,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>I am worried they<U+2019>re not going to vote.<U+201D> Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat who represents a Detroit-area district in Congress, has long said the race there is competitive and is pleased to see the Clinton campaign mobilize. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s going to come down to ground game,<U+201D> she said. High-profile visits, she said, will help turn people out to the polls. <U+201C>We have to turn out the vote.<U+201D> On Sunday, Mrs. Clinton is slated to campaign in Ohio and New Hampshire, where she will be joined by Khizr Khan, whose son was killed in Iraq and who delivered a powerful speech at the Democratic National Convention questioning whether his family, which is Muslim, has a place in Mr. Trump<U+2019>s America . Mr. Trump<U+2019>s subsequent criticism of Mr. Khan and his wife drew widespread condemnation, including from many Republicans. <U+201C>Of all the voices that we have heard in the campaign, I don<U+2019>t believe there is any voice that better embodies the values that we hold as Americans than Mr. and Mrs. Khan have,<U+201D> Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters Sunday. On Monday, Mrs. Clinton is set to end her campaign with a midnight rally in Raleigh, N.C., after her events in Michigan and Pennsylvania. She is scheduled appear at one additional event on Monday in a state yet to be announced. Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com",

The source for these documents is WikiLeaks. The Clinton campaign won<U+2019>t confirm or deny their authenticity, and Mr. Podesta is implying that Russian intelligence hacked his email to help Donald Trump. Maybe so, and these hacks should be met with a forceful U.S. response. But the emails are now in the public domain, and the left celebrated WikiLeaks that damaged the U.S. effort in Afghanistan. The emails show that in 2011 Mr. Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri, who is now a senior Clinton campaign official, received a note from their Center for American Progress colleague John Halpin. Mr. Halpin notes a media report that our News Corp . superiors, Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and CEO Robert Thomson, raise their kids Catholic. Mr. Halpin observes that many leading conservatives are Catholic and opines that they <U+201C>must be attracted to the systematic thought and severely backwards gender relations.<U+201D> Ms. Palmieri responds, <U+201C>I imagine they think it is the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion. Their rich friends wouldn<U+2019>t understand if they became evangelicals.<U+201D> This is a window into the intolerant secular soul of the Democratic establishment and perhaps explains why it has done so little to accommodate requests for religious liberty from the Little Sisters of the Poor. Team Clinton apparently views religion merely as a justification people adopt for their views on politics and gender. Don<U+2019>t Clinton campaign advisers think it<U+2019>s at least possible that a person might be motivated by sincere belief? Mr. Halpin<U+2019>s response to Ms. Palmieri was: <U+201C>Excellent point. They can throw around <U+2018>Thomistic<U+2019> thought and <U+2018>subsidiarity<U+2019> and sound sophisticated because no one knows what the hell they<U+2019>re talking about.<U+201D> We<U+2019>ll leave Thomism to the theologians, but subsidiarity is a concept that the left would do well to consider. It is the idea that social problems are best addressed by the nearest and smallest competent authority, rather than by a faraway state. Individual acts of charity can be highly effective, but the Clinton platform sees virtue only in a centralized bureaucracy sending out welfare checks regardless of results. Clinton advisers would also rather force the church to accept their teachings. In 2012 activist Sandy Newman emailed Mr. Podesta to say there <U+201C>needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship.<U+201D> As if people are forced to believe at the point of a gun. Mr. Podesta responds with an update on what he<U+2019>s been doing to prepare <U+201C>for a moment like this.<U+201D> This disdain for people of faith helps explain today<U+2019>s political polarization and why so many people are willing to support a blunt, avenging force like Donald Trump. Religious Americans know that much of the political establishment detests them. Imagine the media bonfire if emails surfaced from the Trump campaign with similar comments about Islam, but the anti-Catholic emails have received little media attention. To the progressives who dominate American culture and politics, anti-Christian views are the most socially acceptable form of bigotry.",

Seib \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-safe-is-the-market-bet-on-donald-trump-1480350589 \n text: So far, the financial markets love the coming Donald Trump presidency, and why not? They look at the combination of a big tax cut, big infrastructure spending and lower regulations and see economic stimulus all around<U+2014>big-league stimulus, as the president-elect might say. Less obvious is the implicit assumption the markets are making that two looming problems with all this stimulation won<U+2019>t short-circuit the good times. The first is that Mr. Trump won<U+2019>t set off a crippling global trade war with some of his more protectionist impulses, and the second is that the federal budget deficit won<U+2019>t grow into the kind of problem that can derail everything else. So far, though, optimism prevails, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen more than 4% since Election Day. But are the markets making a safe bet? Will a Trump administration get the economic stimulus it envisions without the trade and deficit drags that could pull it down? Let<U+2019>s look at each element in turn: TAX CUTS: The climate for a big tax cut next year will be better than at any time since the second set of President George W. Bush <U+2019>s cuts passed Congress in 2003. That<U+2019>s because Republicans have full control of all the levers of government<U+2014>presidency, House and Senate<U+2014>for the first time in a decade. That doesn<U+2019>t mean a tax cut is certain. Republicans have a working majority in the House, but barely hung on to their majority in the Senate. They have 51 seats there now, and probably will have 52 after a Senate runoff in Louisiana. Given that tax bills can pass the Senate with a simple majority that might be enough. Still, with likely across-the-board Democratic opposition, it also leaves little margin for error. Historical reminder: Vice President Dick Cheney had to cast the tiebreaking vote to get that 2003 tax cut through a Republican Congress. Chances for Republican unity were enhanced considerably when the Trump team scaled back its tax cut plan late in the campaign to bring it closer to the blueprint drawn up by House Speaker Paul Ryan. There remain important differences on offsetting items to reduce the deficit impact, but chances for a significant tax cut are pretty good. INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING: In theory, everybody in Washington loves more infrastructure spending. In reality, there are enormous differences, between parties and within the GOP, on how to pay for it. Some Republicans, especially House conservatives, aren<U+2019>t nearly as enthused as Mr. Trump seems to be about using deficit spending to improve roads, bridges and airports<U+2014>a reality he seemed to acknowledge in an interview with the New York Times last week when he said his infrastructure plan is <U+201C>not a very Republican thing.<U+201D> Can Mr. Trump use Republican votes to pass a big tax cut and then Democratic votes to get a big infrastructure plan through? Perhaps that is what an unorthodox president who essentially ran as an independent can do. But it will be trickier than it looks on the potholed surface. LOWER REGULATIONS: A rollback of regulations may be the safest bet of all, simply because the executive branch can largely act on its own. Already, the expectation that bank regulations will ease, if only through looser enforcement, has helped drive up bank stocks. Beyond that, environmental regulations top the business wish list; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce points to ozone rules, power plant emission requirements and clean-water regulations as areas where it would like changes. A word of caution, though: Changing regulations takes time, and lawsuits inevitably will tie up some changes in court. TRADE WARS: This may be the biggest question mark. Loose campaign talk about imposing big tariffs on goods coming from China and Mexico raised fears of a global trade war that would drag down economic activity all around. Since the election, Mr. Trump has reiterated his promise to pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pending free-trade agreement in Asia. But other trade talk has softened. Trump rhetoric has focused more toward renegotiating elements of the North American Free Trade Agreement than on simply bolting from it, and the talk of unilaterally imposing big, protectionist tariffs has faded. Trade tensions still lie ahead, and China is stepping into the free-trade void in Asia quite nicely, to the potential detriment of American companies. But visions of an all-out trade war aren<U+2019>t as vivid as some feared. DEFICITS: This is the big potential showstopper for the Trump stimulus. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Trump<U+2019>s plans would add $5.3 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade. House Republicans, in particular, don<U+2019>t like that kind of number, and that has the potential to mess with both tax-cut and infrastructure plans. Look for a moment of truth in mid-2017, when a Republican president and a Republican Congress have to agree on a plan to raise the federal debt ceiling or face a market-rattling default on American debt.

Elizabeth Warren and her progressive allies are pushing Hillary Clinton to curb the market power of tech giants like Apple, Amazon and Google <U+2014> putting the Democratic nominee in a bind over how hard to police an industry that's showered her with money and support in 2016. If she wins in November, Clinton would have to fill a raft of positions at the Justice Department and the FTC, the government<U+2019>s twin cops on the competition beat. The tech industry <U+2014> which has largely avoided major showdowns with Washington's antitrust regulators during the Obama administration <U+2014> could easily face new scrutiny if Clinton bows to the Warren wing and appoints people with a tougher eye for enforcement. Story Continued Below The Massachusetts senator this year has publicly rebuked Silicon Valley's biggest brands for amassing excessive market power to stifle smaller competitors. Her rallying cries have already nudged Clinton leftward: The former secretary of state, in a speech in Ohio this month, pledged to \"appoint tough, independent authorities to strengthen antitrust enforcement and really scrutinize mergers and acquisitions, so the big don<U+2019>t keep getting bigger and bigger.\" And the national political climate certainly doesn't favor bigness: Both Clinton's and Donald Trump's campaigns raised doubts when AT&T just this weekend announced its $85.4 billion telecom mega-merger with Time Warner. Once in office, Clinton is sure to face even more pressure from progressive Democrats to translate her statements into nominees who are willing to go toe-to-toe with the big players in the Valley. And the tech industry, which has generously supported Clinton, is starting to take notice. 2016 By Annie Karni \"I think it<U+2019>d be a lot of heartburn, a major amount of heartburn,\" said Rob Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech-backed think tank in Washington. \"You could potentially see a lot more investigations and even enforcements against companies just because they are big.\" If Warren prevails, he added: \"I could see them having a field day, and just going after tech companies.\" The communications and electronics sector has been a prolific donor to Clinton in 2016, generating $39 million for her campaign compared with a measly $787,000 for Donald Trump, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman at Google's parent company, Alphabet, is a digital adviser to Clinton, while Apple CEO Tim Cook has hosted a fundraiser for the Democratic nominee. Clinton further solidified her Silicon Valley support with a tech policy platform, unveiled in June, that<U+2019>s extremely friendly to the industry<U+2019>s interests: It supports net neutrality, calls for universal high-speed internet for all Americans by 2020 and touts the need for high-skilled immigration reform <U+2014> a top priority for tech giants that want to bring in more foreign engineers. But Warren <U+2014> an active Clinton surrogate who's expected to be a powerful voice in the next Congress <U+2014> isn't as cozy with the tech industry. In a speech in June, she mentioned Apple, Amazon and Google by name as she railed against online platforms that had become \"a tool to snuff out competition.\" Warren also pointed to the European Union<U+2019>s recent antitrust charges against Google, saying that <U+201C>Europeans may soon enjoy better protections than U.S. customers.<U+201D> The FTC, under the Obama administration, closed its own probe of Google in 2013 without seeking major changes to the company's business. 2016 By Zachary Warmbrodt , Ben White and Tony Romm If elected, Clinton will need to fill a key vacancy heading up the antitrust division of DOJ, a post currently held on an interim basis by Renata Hesse. That agency already is slated to review the proposed AT&T-Time Warner deal. And Clinton could have as many as two open Democratic slots on the five-member FTC. The agency<U+2019>s current chair, Edith Ramirez, may leave at the end of the Obama administration, though she's declined to discuss her plans. \"I think people are going to be watching very carefully to see who she appoints and how aggressive she wants to move on some of these pressing issues, notwithstanding her sources of financing in the primaries and the general election,<U+201D> said Robert Reich, who served as secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton and has written about his concerns over tech industry consolidation. <U+201C>After all, she<U+2019>s probably going to want to run again in the year 2020, and I don<U+2019>t think she<U+2019>s going to get a free pass from the base of the Democratic Party unless she acts on some of these issues,\" Reich said in an interview. On the Hill, meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut <U+2014> who has called on the FTC to reopen its probe of Google <U+2014> stressed to POLITICO that \"aggressive antitrust enforcement must be a central component to any administration.\" \"The last several years have seen a record number of mergers and acquisitions <U+2014> deals representing trillions of dollars <U+2014> in a trend that shows no signs of slowing down,\" Blumenthal said, adding that the \"first priority of any incoming Administration must be to sizably increase the budgets for antitrust enforcement at these agencies, so that they can both prosecute mergers and investigate conduct cases that violate the law.\" Already, a shortlist has emerged of potential Clinton antitrust officials, according to policy veterans closely watching the campaign, and it's not clear yet how they will be received by progressives. 2016 By Gabriel Debenedetti Among the names is Richard Parker, an antitrust attorney at the law firm O<U+2019>Melveny & Myers. He's a recent Clinton donor and a longtime competition lawyer with a DOJ background <U+2014> and the vice chair of his firm, Tom Donilon, is aiding Clinton's transition team. Others being floated are Peter Swire, a onetime White House tech policy aide to Bill Clinton who's now a professor at Georgia Institute of Technology, and Phil Weiser, a former senior counsel at DOJ<U+2019>s antitrust division now at the University of Colorado Law School. Clinton could also seek to tap current government officials for elevated roles. In recent months, both Hesse at DOJ and Democratic FTC Commissioner Terrell McSweeny have spoken publicly about the need for more robust U.S. antitrust enforcement. <U+201C>Competition enforcers should not turn a blind eye toward anti-competitive behavior in high-tech markets simply because we cannot predict the future with certainty,<U+201D> McSweeny, a potential candidate for FTC chair, told the Washington Center for Equitable Growth in October. Progressives like Warren have yet to sound off on the slate of names, and the senator's office declined to discuss the names for this story. Some tech giants expect Clinton and her staff can be \"pro-business and pro-consumer at the same time,<U+201D> said Ed Black, the president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group comprised of companies like Intel and Google. But he warned against the sort of approach backed by Warren and her allies, saying it could have far-reaching consequences. <U+201C>That would be a signal for everybody in the world to make our companies a target,<U+201D> Black said.

The Hang Seng Index reversed Monday<U+2019>s steep losses and ended up 0.5% Tuesday. Japan<U+2019>s Nikkei Stock Average closed about flat even as the yen gained 0.3% against the dollar. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think the dollar<U+2019>s uptrend will be disrupted easily, but it would not be a surprise to see an adjustment of speed,<U+201D> said Takuya Kanda, a senior researcher at Gaitame.Com Research Institute. The S&P/ASX 200 ended 0.4% lower, reacting to an overnight decline in commodity prices. BHP Billiton dropped 1.2%, and Rio Tinto fell 0.8%. Hong Kong-listed commodities companies were among the worst performers on the Hang Seng Index. This followed a tightening of the rules for trading iron ore and steel rebar futures in China, to cool price gains and rein in rampant speculative trading. Iron ore and steel rebar futures fell by the maximum 6% allowed on Tuesday in Shanghai, and Chinese metals and mining firms dominated losers in Hong Kong trade on the same day. The Hang Seng Index tracking stocks in the materials industry led declines among Hang Seng subindexes, and was last down 1.1%. South Korea<U+2019>s Kospi slipped 0.4%, reversing earlier gains, but Singapore<U+2019>s FTSE Strait Times was up 0.5%. Japan financial stocks got a boost Tuesday when 10-year Japan government bond yields hit 0%, climbing out of negative territory for the first time since Sept. 21. Japan banks and insurance firms invest heavily in JGBs and profit greatly when yields rise. Among individual stocks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial was up 4.2%, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial climbed 3.8% while Mizuho Financial gained 1.3%. In Japan, the Topix bank subsection hit a nine-month high, ending up 2%. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to roll out a large fiscal stimulus, lower corporate taxes and vastly increased infrastructure spending. This has pushed up inflation expectations in the U.S. and the yields of U.S. Treasurys, vacuuming cash from Asian emerging markets. However, Asian currencies broadly got a reprieve Tuesday. The Thai baht was up 0.4% against the U.S. dollar with the Taiwan dollar gaining 0.6% against the greenback, according to Thomson Reuters. The Indonesian rupiah, which has been battered by the flight of capital to higher-yielding U.S. assets, was down 0.2%. The Malaysian ringgit stayed under pressure, and was last down 0.3%. The Korean won was up 0.1%. Meanwhile, China-share traders took in stride the fact that China<U+2019>s onshore yuan dropped to an eight-year low against the U.S. dollar early Tuesday. The Shanghai Composite Index closed down only 0.1%. A strong dollar drove the yuan devaluation, with the U.S. Dollar Index on Monday surpassing 100 for the first time since last December. But concerns of drastic capital outflows from China<U+2014>aided by rising U.S. Treasury yields<U+2014>have eased over the past two days, said Zhu Bin, an analyst at Southwest Securities. <U+201C>Growing bearish sentiment on the U.S. bond market may hold off the Fed<U+2019>s plan to hike rates,<U+201D> Mr. Zhu said.

But when Rudy began trying to filibuster, Cuomo interrupted him and said he while he might not agree with the decision the FBI made to not charge Clinton with any wrongdoing when it came to her email server, Giuliani wasn<U+2019>t entitled to make things up: \nNext, Giuliani began ranting about some <U+201C>bribe<U+201D> that predated the email controversy, and that was when Cuomo shut him down with one line : <U+201C>My entire life because you<U+2019>re so accurate and all of a sudden, you<U+2019>re in Trumpland and the facts are all over the place.<U+201D> \nAs if he hadn<U+2019>t been embarrassed enough, Giuliani then attempted to start talking about the recent announcement that Obamacare premiums will rise by as much as 25 percent in 2017: <U+201C>As a result, because the Democrats forced this down the Republicans<U+2019> throat, the ACA, they decided to punish them.

        "input": "time: null \n author: William<U+00A0>Mauldin \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-makes-a-long-shot-bid-for-tpp-trade-deal-1478014457 \n text: President Barack Obama is forging ahead with a long-shot bid to bring a 12-nation Pacific trade agreement to a vote in Congress immediately after an election<U+00A0>that has stirred deep antitrade sentiments in both parties. The administration<U+2019>s push<U+2014>which includes campaign support for congressional allies<U+00A0>and targeted bids to convert naysayers<U+2014>marks a huge wager that a majority of House and Senate lawmakers<U+00A0>might brush aside the<U+00A0>opposition of both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to the trade deal and embrace it. The stakes are high: A defeat of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, would deprive Mr. Obama of a major legislative accomplishment in the last weeks of his presidency and could harm U.S. ties with other countries in the bloc. The administration and GOP congressional leaders may choose not to seek a vote during the postelection lame duck period if it remains well shy of drawing majority support. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re doing everything we possibly can to maximize the chance of getting it done,<U+201D> said Mike Froman, the U.S. trade representative, in an interview. Mr. Froman<U+00A0>visited Nashville, Tenn., on Friday<U+00A0>to talk up<U+00A0>the TPP<U+2019>s intellectual-property provision with the record industry and to trumpet its proposed lower tariffs abroad with U.S. whiskey distillers.<U+00A0>Mr. Froman, one of half a dozen top officials participating in TPP events last week, has<U+00A0>spoken with nearly 100 House Republicans in the past few months, and cabinet-level officials have participated in more than 60 TPP events this year. Trade experts following the TPP fight say the agreement probably lacks sufficient votes to pass the House, given the political rhetoric this year and rising skepticism toward trade within the GOP. Still,<U+00A0>they say the odds of<U+00A0>the deal<U+2019>s being approved aren<U+2019>t nil. The TPP would<U+00A0>lower tariffs and set commercial rules of the road for a 12-nation bloc that includes Japan, Australia, Mexico and Vietnam. In pitching the deal to wary lawmakers, the administration is leaning heavily on foreign policy, arguing the TPP would shore up alliances around the Pacific and counter the growing economic and military influence of China. Officials also are telling lawmakers it is their last chance to support the Pacific deal, because Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have said they wouldn<U+2019>t back the current agreement or even a<U+00A0>modified but similar<U+00A0>version. If she wins, Mrs. Clinton would likely reopen the complicated negotiations and eliminate major provisions backed by business groups, while adding binding rules on currency and other priorities of workers and environmental groups. Few experts think trade agreements would be a top priority in her first term. The administration is working with Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas) the chairman of the House committee that oversees trade, to lessen Republican disappointment with some of the final provisions of the TPP, including the length of intellectual-property protection for biologic drugs and the digital rights of financial firms. <U+201C>They<U+2019>ve been working this agreement very hard,<U+201D><U+00A0>Mr. Brady<U+00A0>said. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t fault the effort<U+2014>I think this is an important agreement, so I<U+2019>m really eager for these outstanding issues to be resolved.<U+201D> Mr. Obama is relying on Republicans to provide most of the votes for the TPP, as they did for <U+201C>fast track<U+201D> legislation last year that laid the groundwork for the agreement, reached last October , and expedited the process of congressional approval. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, while strong advocates of free trade, have nevertheless echoed the committee leaders<U+2019> disappointment in the TPP and played down the chances of a vote after the election. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s rallying cry against all trade agreements<U+2014>and his defense of tariffs<U+2014>have moved Republicans, particularly in the House, more into the antitrade column. About a dozen of the 190 House Republicans who supported fast track have since come out against the TPP. The administration is<U+00A0>collaborating<U+00A0>with business and farm groups to target the House GOP, despite its typical opposition to the president, in an effort to boost potential votes. Mr. Obama<U+2019>s team also is trying to shore up and expand the ranks of the 28 Democratic lawmakers who supported him on trade by voting for fast track. The White House can likely count on at least a small handful of additional Democratic votes for the TPP in the House, according to people following the<U+00A0>trade<U+00A0>campaign. Mr. Obama and the administration helped the Democratic fast-track supporters<U+00A0>who were<U+00A0>facing re-election beat back primary challengers, likely assuring that all are re-elected, said Rep. Ron Kind (D., Wis.). <U+201C>I asked him to do a robocall for me, a quote on a mailer, a video endorsement spot. Every request that was made, they came through and honored,<U+201D> said Mr. Kind, who leads the New Democrats coalition in the House, which supports business and economic growth and is a frequent source of votes for trade agreements. But some of the TPP<U+2019>s previous supporters have strayed this year. Republican Rep. Charles Boustany moved against the deal after previously leading the House<U+2019>s trade subcommittee and helping found the congressional Friends of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Caucus, which trumpeted the deal<U+2019>s benefits for U.S. exporters, including in his district in Louisiana. Now Mr. Boustany is locked in a sprawling Senate election that may not end until a runoff later this year. <U+201C>The agreement in its current form is not satisfactory to the congressman and many of his colleagues,<U+201D> a spokesman said<U+00A0>last week. Mr. Obama is set to travel<U+00A0>Nov. 18<U+00A0>to a Pacific summit to discuss the fate of the TPP, among other things. By then, congressional leaders will likely have signaled whether they will press for a vote. Aides estimate four weeks<U+00A0>may be<U+00A0>needed to move the agreement through committees and the floor of the House and Senate, which is the amount of time the lawmakers are scheduled to be in Washington for the postelection session. <U+201C>It is a tight timetable, but it can be done in that time frame,<U+201D> said Mr. Brady.

However, where the tool was kept and used locally became an area unsafe for children. Children who got near this tool tended to have increased blood pressure and increased stress hormones, lower reading skills, poorer memories, impaired auditory and speech perception, and impaired academic performance. \nMost of us would find this situation at least a little concerning, unless the new invention was designed to murder lots of people. Then it'd be just fine. \nNow, imagine if this same new tool ruined neighborhoods because people couldn't safely live near it. Imagine if the government had to compensate people but kick them out of living near the location of this tool. Again, I think, we might find that troubling if mass murder were not the mission. \nImagine also that this tool fairly frequently explodes, emitting highly toxic chemicals, particles, and fibers unsafe to breathe into the air for miles around. Normally, that'd be a problem. But if this tool is needed for killing lots of people, we'll work with its flaws, won't we? \nNow, what if this new gadget was expected to cost at least $1,400,000,000,000 over 50 years? And what if that money had to be taken away from numerous other expenses more beneficial for the economy and the world? What if the $1.4 trillion was drained out of the economy causing a loss of jobs and a radical diminuition of resources for education, healthcare, housing, environmental protection, or humanitarian aid? Wouldn't that be a worry in some cases, I mean in those cases where the ability to kill tons of human beings wasn't at stake? \nWhat if this product, even when working perfectly, was a leading destroyer of the earth's natural environment? \nWhat if this high-tech toy wasn't even designed to do what was expected of it and wasn't even able to do what it was designed for? \nAmazingly, even those shortcomings do not matter as long as the intention is massive murder and destruction. Then, all is forgiven. \nThe tool I'm describing is called the F-35. At RootsAction.org you can find a new petition launched by locally-minded people acting globally in places where the F-35 is intended to be based. Also at that link you'll find explanations of how the tool I've been decribing is the F-35. \nThe petition is directed to the United States Congress and the governments of Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan and South Korea from the world and from the people of Burlington, Vermont, and Fairbanks, Alaska, where the F-35 is to be based. This effort is being initiated by Vermont Stop the F35 Coalition, Save Our Skies Vermont, Western Maine Matters, Alaska Peace Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks Peace Club, North Star Chapter 146 Veterans For Peace, World Beyond War, RootsAction.org, Code Pink, and Ben Cohen. \nThe petition reads: \nThe F-35 is a weapon of offensive war, serving no defensive purpose. It is planned to cost the U.S. $1.4 trillion over 50 years. Because starvation on earth could be ended for $30 billion and the lack of clean drinking water for $11 billion per year, it is first and foremost through the wasting of resources that this airplane will kill. Military spending, contrary to popular misconception, also hurts the U.S. economy ( see here ) and other economies. The F-35 causes negative health impacts and cognitive impairment in children living near its bases. It renders housing near airports unsuitable for residential use. It has a high crash rate and horrible consequences to those living in the area of its crashes. Its emissions are a major environmental polluter. \nWars are endangering the United States and other participating nations rather than protecting them. Nonviolent tools of law, diplomacy, aid, crisis prevention, and verifiable nuclear disarmament should be substituted for continuing counterproductive wars. Therefore, we, the undersigned, call for the immediate cancellation of the F-35 program as a whole, and the immediate cancellation of plans to base any such dangerous and noisy jets near populated areas. We oppose replacing the F-35 with any other weapon or basing the F-35 in any other locations. We further demand redirection of the money for the F-35 back into taxpayers' pockets, and into environmental and human needs in the U.S., other F-35 customer nations, and around the world, including to fight climate change, pay off student debt, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, and improve education, healthcare, and housing.",

Reports out of the city suggest heavy firing against government-held neighborhoods. \nWhile details are still emerging, 12 civilians were reported slain in the firing, and around 200 others were wounded . This toll is independent of the toll from fighting on the ground between rebels and military forces, for which no official figures have yet been released. \nThe Russian ceasefire is intended to offer a 10-hour window during which the rebels can leave the city freely through two corridors, taking their weapons and anything else with them, though the rebels have already denounced both the offer and the ceasefire, insisting they will never surrender the city. \nBoth sides have been trading fire for months, often shelling one another<U+2019>s neighborhoods, attacks which tend to kill a lot more civilian bystanders than combatants. They also trade offensives and counteroffensives, aiming to take control of the entire city. \nSo far, neither side has been able to get serious gains in the fighting over the city. Some smaller gains by the Syrian military last month appear to be getting reversed with this new offensive by the rebels from outside the city. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",

Bloomberg reported , <U+201C> U.S. stocks erased gains as markets again showed themselves sensitive to perceptions about Clinton<U+2019>s prospects. The Mexican peso dropped, a reflection of Trump<U+2019>s plan to renegotiate trade pacts with the country and reduce immigration. <U+201C> \nImpeachment \nThere was also turmoil in betting markets, as the odds on a Trump presidency rose by double digits. Odds on a President Hillary Clinton being impeached in her first term also skyrocketed, as the Democratic nominee faces up to a future engulfed by endless scandal. On Thursday Clinton warned her supporters the next 11 days will be rocky <U+2013> but the bumpy ride will continue long after the election. \nThough Hillary remains favorite with betting markets, the pattern is remarkably similar to odds for Brexit in the weeks before the vote. The Remain camp was considered a certainty until weeks before the referendum, with a sharp dive in the last week. Analysts believe a repeat of the British anti-establishment vote is on the cards. \nOne of Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s most vocal critics on the business side is finance commentator and markets expert Jim Rickards.

The former president<U+2019>s Secret Service detail nicknamed the mistress <U+201C>Energizer<U+201D> because of the way Bill always <U+201C>perked up<U+201D> and seemed revitalized after her visits. Julie McMahon has been outed by the press as Bill Clinton<U+2019>s <U+201C>Energizer,<U+201D> a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Energizer Bunny. This mother of three and socialite has publicly denied being one of Clinton<U+2019>s lovers, but a plethora of purported evidence is now unfolding online in an effort to refute McMahon<U+2019>s claims of innocence, as per Bizpac Review . McMahon reportedly lives just a few minutes away from Bill and Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s home in New York, which is called Whitehaven. If the Clintons were Republicans, the liberal mainstream media would be calling them racists over the chosen name of their luxurious estate. Always, Julia McMahon would arrive at Whitehaven via SUV. She would only stay a few hours sometimes, but other times she would spend an entire week at the Clinton residence. Julia McMahon reportedly met both Bill and Hillary in 1998 when he was president. Although the Clinton campaign has tried to label McMahon a friend to both of the Clintons, she only visited or spent the night at the house when Hillary wasn<U+2019>t home, the Daily Mail reports. Sometimes, McMahon allegedly arrived just mere minutes after the departure of the former first lady. The Secret Service agents on the Clinton Whitehaven detail were reportedly not ever privy to the woman<U+2019>s name, but they were allegedly under strict orders not to approach or stop her when she arrived. Every member of a president<U+2019>s family is protected by a Secret Service detail. The Secret Service reportedly uses the same letter to assign a codename to protectees.

Inner Earth (Agartha) Glows Like in the Movie Avatar Can there be light below the surface of the Earth, without any exposure to the Sun? Surprisingly, th... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/10/inner-earth-agartha-glows-like-in-movie.html Can there be light below the surface of the Earth, without any exposure to the Sun? Surprisingly, the answer is YES. Bioluminescent organisms have the ability to glow almost like magic. Many organisms use their natural ability to produce light to trick predators, to attract mates and even to communicate. The word for this seemingly magical ability is called <U+201C>bioluminescence,<U+201D> which comes from <U+201C>bio,<U+201D> meaning life, and <U+201C>lumin,<U+201D> meaning light. Most of these organisms, such as plankton, glow blue, but a few glow red, green, or orange. Some tiny animal plankton (zooplankton) are big enough to see with the unaided eye.Most bioluminescent zooplankton don<U+2019>t glow in the dark themselves, but instead squirt globs of glowing chemicals into the water. Some zooplankton use bioluminescence to attract a mate, or to form reproductive swarms. Not only is nature<U+2019>s biochemistry fascinating, it can also be extremely beautiful, especially given the backdrop of a dark, misty cave. Glow worm is the common name for various groups of insect larvae and adult larviform females that glow through bioluminescence. They may sometimes resemble worms, but are actually insects. The glow they produce, through by a chemical reaction, is incredibly efficient; nearly 100% of the energy input is turned into light (Compare this to the best light-emitting diodes at just 24%). Australia and New Zealand have some of the most spectacular caves, where one can go on guided tours to witness this natural phenomenon up close. (see video below) Why do some mushrooms emit light? Making light isn<U+2019>t common in fungi; scientists have described about 100,000 fungal species, and only 75 glow. Lab work has shown that the glow did not happen randomly or by accident. Scientists found that these mushrooms made light mostly at night, so experiments were conducted to determine why. According to studies ( referenced in the book ), in dark environments, bioluminescent fruit bodies may be at an advantage by attracting insects and other arthropods that could help disperse their spores. Conditions that affect the growth of fungi, such as pH, light and temperature, have been found to influence bioluminescence, suggesting a link between metabolic activity and fungal bioluminescence. The diversity of creatures with this ability is equally astonishing, from algae and the common firefly to deep-sea dwellers that are rarely seen by humans. What's also fascinating is that many of these creatures are not closely related, and bioluminescent traits have seemingly evolved separately at least 30 times. With countless well lit subterranean caves and glowing caverns, it makes one wonder what could be dwelling in vast unexplored areas under the crust. The idea that our planet consists of a hollow, or honeycombed, interior is not new. Some of the oldest cultures speak of civilizations inside of vast cavern-cities, within the bowels of the earth. According to certain Buddhist and Hindu traditions, secret tunnels connect Tibet with a subterranean paradise, and they call this legendary underworld Agartha. In India, this underground oasis is best known by its Sanskrit name, Shambhala, thought to mean 'place of tranquility.' Mythologies throughout the world, from North and South America to Europe and the Arctic, describe numerous entrances to these fabled inner kingdoms. Many occult organizations, esoteric authors, and secret societies concur with these myths and legends of subterranean inhabitants, who are the remnants of antediluvian civilizations, which sought refuge in hollow caverns inside the earth. Assuming that the myths are true, and the Earth is partially hollow, how could life survive underground? How would organisms receive the ventilation required to breathe miles below the surface? Surface trees and rainforests are responsible for less than one-third of the Earth<U+2019>s oxygen, while marine plants, such as phytoplankton, are responsible for between 70 to 80 percent of the oxygen in the Earth<U+2019>s atmosphere. The vast majority of our oxygen comes from aquatic organisms. Phytoplankton, kelp, and algae produce oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, a process which converts carbon dioxide and light into sugars which are then used for energy. Phytoplankton is responsible for HALF of Earth's oxygen While the process of photosynthesis usually implies the presence of sunlight, the Sun is not the only available light or energy source able to power photosynthesis. Before the discovery of hydrothermal vents, and their ecosystems, scientists believed that only small animals lived at the ocean bottom, in seafloor sediments. They theorized that these animals received their food from above, because the established model of the marine food chain depended on sunlight and photosynthesis, just as the food chain on land does. Mainstream academia taught that this was the only way life could survive in the darkness of the deep seafloor. The discovery of hydrothermal vents changed all that. It became clear that vast communities of animals grew quickly and to larger than expected sizes in the depths without the aid of the Sun. Instead of using light to create organic material (photosynthesis), microorganisms at the bottom of the food chain at hydrothermal vents used chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide (chemosynthesis). At the seafloor, there are thriving ecosystems that receive energy not from the sun, but from the heat and chemicals provided by the planet itself. For many thousands of species dwelling in the deep, the energy to sustain life does not flow down from above, but comes up from the interior of the earth. Even in the unlikely scenario where every single tree were chopped down, we would still be able to breathe thanks to aquatic plant-life (ex. algae). The Earth has a tremendous amount of water, and these oceans, rivers, and lakes are teeming with numerous species of biologically active, oxygen-producing organisms. Are there any known sources of sustenance available that could provide for a large human population? What evidence is there that a sustainable biosphere could exist miles below the surface, totally isolated from the nourishment and the established life cycle provided by the sun? Where are the entrances to inner earth, and which races live inside? Author and anthropologist, Robert Sepehr , explores these questions and attempts to unlock their riddles, which have eluded any consideration in mainstream academia. Numerous endeavors have been undertaken to access the interior of the earth. Polar expeditions and battles, such as Operation Highjump, still remain largely classified, and have been shrouded in secrecy for decades, but scientific revelations validating the rumors surrounding these covert events, and their implications, are finally being exposed to daylight.

Story Continued Below \"What are you asking?\" a visibly irritated Clinton responded to the questioner at a rally in Immokalee, Florida. \"That is not at all what I said. Oh really? Go read it. Go read it. And don't read it on the internet, don't read it on the internet, get the whole thing. First, I campaigned hard for that law. Second, I risked losing the Congress to pass universal health care. Thirdly, I defended President Obama in 2010 and 2012 and he went up 5 points in the polls after I defended what he did with health care.\" Clinton was not done, though, as he said what is actually crazy are those who do not qualify for subsidies under the law, along with Republicans who continue to try to undermine the reforms at the state level. 2016 By Shane Goldmacher and Annie Karni \"We shouldn't be in denial, the president said the same thing,\" Clinton said. \"I didn't say a thing that the president hadn't already said, or that the health care people in his administration hadn't already said in his administration.\" Clinton landed in hot water when he delivered some off-the-cuff remarks last month in which he slammed parts of Obamacare. <U+201C>So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.

But in recent months, as the American presidential election took a series of bizarre turns, Iranians seeking to make fun of the <U+201C>Great Satan<U+201D> have ditched the arts and crafts and simply switched on their TV sets. Iran <U+2019>s state television, a bastion of conservative ideologues, for once interrupted its regular programing about the <U+201C>murders and crimes committed<U+201D> by the United States and broadcast all three debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump <U+2014> live. In a country that tightly controls information about the United States and depictions of Western democracy generally, the decision to show the debates was unprecedented but by no means inexplicable: The presidential campaign shows the United States political system in such a poor light, hard-liners evidently want it to speak for itself. <U+201C>We only need to sit back and let these candidates show themselves how idiotic they are,<U+201D> said Hamidreza Taraghi, a conservative analyst and a regular guest on state television. <U+201C>The best way for us to prove that the U.S. government is corrupt and hideous is by showing these people live on our TV.<U+201D> Live, yes, but some parts <U+2014> especially those criticizing Iran <U+2014> were not fully translated. After each debate, analysts discussing the outcome were in unanimous agreement that America, in its current state, <U+201C>cannot do a damn thing.<U+201D> To say that Iran<U+2019>s political establishment has been thoroughly enjoying the campaign is an understatement. Last week, Iran<U+2019>s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , called the American election <U+201C>a spectacle for exposing their crimes and debacles.<U+201D> Ayatollah Khamenei seized on the campaign<U+2019>s tawdriest details: accusations of infidelity and sexual assault. <U+201C>The remarks made by these two U.S. presidential candidates over the last few weeks on immoral issues <U+2014> which are, for the most part, not baseless accusations <U+2014> are enough to disgrace America,<U+201D> he said during a speech commemorating the 1979 takeover of the United States Embassy in Tehran. His supporters responded enthusiastically by shouting, <U+201C>Death to America.<U+201D> Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, was not mentioned by name, but the ayatollah seemed to praise his outspokenness, saying: <U+201C>People pay more attention to him.<U+201D> The candidate, he said, is tapping into genuine American dissatisfaction. <U+201C>Because the people look at what he says and see it is true,<U+201D> Ayatollah Khamenei said. <U+201C>They see it in the facts of their lives.<U+201D> Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has been officially anti-American. Many ordinary Iranians have milder feelings for the United States, where over two million of their relatives live. Iran<U+2019>s leaders, long entangled in a battle for power and influence with the United States in the Middle East, have been emboldened by the American withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan. <U+201C>America is no longer a superpower in the region. It<U+2019>s weak in the Middle East. They are now only one of the players,<U+201D> said Jalal Barzegar, a reformist journalist. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s now just a country.<U+201D> For Iranians uninterested in watching the debates, Iran<U+2019>s state television had another option. In recent weeks it has been airing Netflix<U+2019>s <U+201C>House of Cards,<U+201D> called <U+201C>House of Straw<U+201D> here because playing cards is considered un-Islamic. Kevin Spacey<U+2019>s portrayal of the conniving politician Frank Underwood is the perfect embodiment of the <U+201C>inhumane face<U+201D> of American politics, state television officials have said. Apparently, Ayatollah Khamenei has also been watching. In his recent speech, he quoted a line uttered by Mr. Spacey in the series. <U+201C><U+2018>Shake with your right hand, but hold a rock in your left one,<U+2019> as they say themselves,<U+201D> Ayatollah Khamenei said. <U+201C>This is the kind of people they are.<U+201D> A version of this article appears in print on November 7, 2016, on Page A3 of the New York edition with the headline: Iran<U+2019>s Latest Propaganda Tool: U.S. Debates on Live TV.

Trump largely self-funded his campaign during the primary, injecting nearly $50 million into his presidential run. He also boasts about his rigorous campaign schedule as he blasts Hillary Clinton over what he maintains is a lack of stamina and energy. The real estate mogul explained Wednesday that his campaign would be such a waste because his supporters will be unable to change the status quo if Clinton is elected president. <U+201C>If we don<U+2019>t win, we can<U+2019>t change things,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We can<U+2019>t bring back common sense.

The discussions about reducing Iran<U+2019>s<U+00A0>stockpile of enriched uranium<U+00A0>started months ago, officials said, and are among a number of measures the Obama administration has been examining to fortify the accord in its final months in office. But the initiative has taken on new urgency since the election of President-elect Donald Trump created fresh uncertainty around the deal. If agreed upon, the plan could reduce the odds of a sudden flashpoint between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran<U+2019>s implementation of the deal once Mr. Trump takes office , Western officials say, by reducing its enriched-uranium stockpile well below the cap agreed to in the 2015 accord. Officials say the plan would also lengthen, for a while, Iran<U+2019>s so-called breakout time<U+2014>the amount of time it would take the country to accumulate enough material for one nuclear weapon were it to quit or violate the deal<U+2014>though it is unclear by how much. The constraints of the nuclear agreement are currently set up to ensure it would take Iran at least a year to produce the ingredients for a nuclear weapon. Neither the Trump transition team nor Iranian officials immediately responded to requests for comment on the initiative. While on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to scrap and, alternately, renegotiate the deal, and his picks to his national security team so far suggest his administration will take a hard line with Tehran.<U+00A0>On Wednesday, Iran<U+2019>s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened a response if the U.S. extended Iranian sanctions<U+2014>as House lawmakers this week voted to do<U+2014>for another decade. Western officials, though, say Iranian officials have engaged in serious discussions about the new plan but haven<U+2019>t so far committed to it. In the past, Iran has proven sensitive about moves that would curtail its rights to enrich uranium under the accord. Having that right was a demand Iran<U+2014>which has always denied any intent to develop nuclear weapons<U+2014>made a priority in the nuclear-deal negotiations. Nonetheless, Iran has sent abroad or blended into natural uranium thousands of kilograms of enriched uranium since the July 2015 accord. That agreement sought, among other things, to ensure that<U+00A0>Iran<U+00A0>couldn<U+2019>t speedily accrue enough of key ingredients, such as enriched uranium and plutonium, to build a nuclear weapon. Under the deal with the U.S. and five other governments, including Russia, Iran agreed to cap<U+00A0>its stockpile of enriched uranium at 300 kilograms (661 pounds) for the next 15 years. The agreement also set a cap of 130 metric tons (143.3 U.S. tons) on<U+00A0>Iran<U+2019>s stockpile of heavy water, a material that can be used to cool uranium in a process to produce plutonium. Last week, the head of the United Nations atomic agency overseeing the<U+00A0>Iranian<U+00A0>nuclear agreement called out<U+00A0>Iran<U+00A0>for exceeding the heavy-water cap for a second time this year. International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Yukiya Amano warned<U+00A0>that Iran<U+00A0>could undermine confidence in the implementation of the deal if Tehran crossed key limits again. Iran<U+00A0>reacted swiftly and sent 11 tons of heavy water to Oman early this week, likely putting Iran below the 130-metric-ton limit for months to come, people familiar with the situation said. The plan that the U.S. and its partners are currently discussing with Iran would take<U+00A0>Tehran<U+2019>s stockpile<U+00A0>far from the 300-kilogram limit on enriched uranium, Western officials said, ensuring that it wouldn<U+2019>t exceed the cap for some time. When the nuclear deal was closed,<U+00A0>Iran<U+00A0>had an estimated 100 kilograms of enriched uranium stuck in the pipes and machinery at its currently mothballed enriched<U+00A0>uranium facility in Isfahan in central Iran. People familiar with the discussions, which have taken place among Iranian, U.S. and European nuclear experts, say that if an agreement is reached, Iran could, in a matter of a few weeks to a couple of months, clean out the facility and the pipes and machinery in a way which degrades the uranium so that it isn<U+2019>t usable for potential future use in a weapon. Officials say there are various ways that could be done without dismantling the facility including, for example, flushing the pipes with chemicals to create a liquid waste that would be very hard to turn back into powder form for enriching into weapons-grade uranium. <U+201C>The idea is to render material that is already incredibly difficult to recover unrecoverable,<U+201D> said one Western official. Some nuclear experts have complained that neither the IAEA, Iran, the U.S. nor the EU, which helps oversee the deal<U+2019>s implementation, have clearly defined what they count as <U+201C>unrecoverable<U+201D> material<U+2014>uranium that is genuinely impossible to separate out and redeploy. They argue that some uranium may have been exempted from the cap over the past year, which, while time-consuming and difficult, isn<U+2019>t impossible to reconstitute into more dangerous forms of enriched uranium. Officials say that in the new political context, given the uncertainties over the nuclear deal, action by Iran<U+00A0>to ensure it significantly reduces its current enriched uranium stockpile, would be a clear win-win. <U+201C>It is in everyone<U+2019>s interest that<U+00A0>Iran<U+00A0>continues to remain under the limits set in the JCPOA,<U+201D> said a senior U.S. administration official, using the acronym for the agreement. People familiar with<U+00A0>Iran<U+2019>s actions say<U+00A0>Iran<U+00A0>has also run depleted uranium at other facilities to slow its production of enriched uranium. Others say<U+00A0>Iran<U+00A0>may have deliberately slowed production of heavy water by keeping its two production units at the nuclear site of Arak shut down for longer than technically necessary, although there is no hard evidence for that. The enriched-uranium initiative is one of several by the U.S. administration to bolster the agreement before President Barack Obama leaves office. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the administration was also considering steps to provide licenses for more American businesses to enter the Iranian market and the lifting of additional U.S. sanctions.

More than any other group, American Indians are shackled by bureaucratic red tape that deprives them of the same rights and dignity as other Americans. The continuing debate over the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline, which would pass near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, highlights the desire of Native Americans to have their voices heard. In that case, the tribe claims they were not sufficiently consulted on the location of the pipeline project that might affect their land and water. But the question of Indian rights goes far beyond the location of a single pipeline: Shouldn<U+2019>t Native Americans be free to make their own decisions about the use of natural resources in Indian Country? When Columbus stumbled into America, indigenous people already had a rich cultural and economic history. Lessons in farming from Eastern tribes are now the stuff of Thanksgiving legend. Vast indigenous trading networks stretched all across the continent. West Coast fishing tribes were so rich that they could afford to destroy some of their wealth, such as canoes, baskets and even food, in <U+201C>potlatch<U+201D> ceremonies. Moreover, Native Americans showed a remarkable ability to adapt to new goods and technology. Italian trade beads became an integral part of American Indian decoration and art. The Spanish horse transformed Plains Indian hunting and warfare. Over centuries, however, these adaptations and innovations have been replaced by subjugation by the U.S. government. In 1831, Chief Justice John Marshall declared the Cherokees to be a <U+201C>domestic dependent nation<U+201D> and characterized the relationship of tribes to the U.S. as resembling <U+201C>that of a ward to his guardian.<U+201D> Marshall<U+2019>s words were entrenched when Congress became trustee of all Indian lands and resources under the Dawes Act of 1887. In recent decades, the government has paid lip service to <U+201C>tribal sovereignty,<U+201D> but in practice Native Americans have little autonomy. Tribes and individual Indians still cannot own their land on reservations. This means Native Americans cannot mortgage their assets for loans like other Americans, thus allowing them little or no access to credit. This makes it incredibly difficult to start a business in Indian Country. Even when tribes try to engage in economic activity, the feds impose mountains of regulations, all in the name of looking after Indian affairs. As just one example, consider tribes<U+2019> inability to develop their natural resources, which was the topic of a field hearing by the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee last week in Santa Fe, N.M. Nearly every aspect of energy development on reservations<U+2014>such as reviews and approvals of even the most basic land-use decisions<U+2014>is controlled by federal agencies. By all accounts, though, the federal government has failed to live up to its responsibility as trustee of Indian assets. For instance, a 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office found that poor management by the Bureau of Indian Affairs has hindered Indian energy development, resulting in <U+201C>missed development opportunities, lost revenue, and jeopardized viability of projects.<U+201D> Indian energy resources hold significant potential to help lift tribes out of poverty. Their value, according to an estimate by the Council of Energy Resource Tribes, could be as high as $1.5 trillion. But the federal government makes it difficult for tribes to capitalize on their resource wealth. On Indian lands, developers must go through 49 steps and at least four federal agencies just to acquire a permit for energy development, compared with only four steps off reservations. It<U+2019>s not uncommon for several years to pass before the necessary approvals are acquired to begin development on Indian lands<U+2014>a process that takes only a few months on private lands. The result is that most tribal energy resources remain undeveloped, even when tribes themselves want to capitalize on their energy wealth. <U+201C>Willing and able tribes should have greater authority over energy development on tribal lands,<U+201D> said Mike Olguin of the Southern Ute tribe at the Santa Fe hearing. <U+201C>In some instances, the best way for the United States to uphold its trust responsibility would be to step aside.<U+201D> Last year, both chambers of Congress passed bipartisan legislation that would give tribes greater authority over energy development on their lands. Yet the Obama administration opposes the bill, claiming that it undermines federal oversight of Indian resources. This Columbus Day/Indigenous Peoples<U+2019> Day, politicians shouldn<U+2019>t just pay lip service to tribal sovereignty. They should give Native Americans the freedom to make their own decisions, not just about energy development, but about the future of their land, cultures and economies.

If it<U+2019>s not started soon, we<U+2019>re just going to be in a free fall.<U+201D> It took Congress another year and a half, but some of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s wishes eventually came true<U+00A0>as part of a loosening of federal tax rules that was highly friendly to the real-estate industry. Several people who participated in the early 1990s debate in Congress said that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s high-profile push for changes had only a minimal role in shaping the legislation.<U+00A0>Real-estate trade groups were prominent in lobbying for the breaks. Still, some observers are now wondering whether tax provisions adopted by Congress in 1993<U+00A0>enhanced<U+00A0>Mr. Trump<U+2019>s ability to claim an extraordinary $916 million in<U+00A0>losses on his 1995 tax returns , as was revealed this past weekend. <U+201C>Trump is exactly the type of business taxpayer<U+201D> that the 1993 amendments were intended to help, said Martin McMahon Jr., a University of Florida tax law professor. Both Mr. Trump<U+2019>s businesses and he personally <U+201C>clearly could benefit from these rules,<U+201D> Mr. McMahon added. Whether Mr. Trump relied on benefits stemming from the 1993 changes isn<U+2019>t clear, but in defending his 1995 returns this week, he said he had been <U+201C>a big beneficiary<U+201D> of the tax laws, which he criticized as overly complex and unfair.<U+00A0>He didn<U+2019>t provide specifics. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Thursday the changes were sought by a broad coalition of the real-estate industry. At the 1991 hearing, Mr. Trump urged lawmakers in particular to roll back the strict limits they had imposed on taking tax losses for some <U+201C>passive<U+201D> real-estate investments. Those rules were preventing even full-time developers from using losses on their leased buildings in some circumstances. Congress in 1993 did indeed roll back those limits, at least for real-estate professionals, though it didn<U+2019>t go as far as Mr. Trump suggested. The limits had been adopted in a landmark 1986 tax overhaul, as a way to curb then-rampant tax shelters, in which wealthy investors were receiving outsize losses to offset their income. Mr. Trump blamed the 1986 act for pulling the rug out from under the real-estate sector and helping to trigger the savings-and-loan crisis, as well as the industry downturn. Lawmakers in the 1993 legislation also gave beaten-down real-estate investors additional ability to take large losses from leveraged property, without suffering a penalty, because the loans had been written off or renegotiated. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s push for changes<U+00A0>became the face of the debate for a time during the early 1990s. When then-President George H.W. Bush proposed loosening the passive-loss rules in his 1992 State of the Union address, congressional Democrats quickly pounced. According to news accounts, congressional Democrats ran a television ad in early 1992 that showed a tipsy Trump look-alike at a party who finally drops his champagne glass to the floor, where it shatters. <U+201C>In the 1980s, Republicans threw a big party. Only the rich were invited,<U+201D> the ad said. <U+201C>Now the Republicans are at it again<U+2026>The party<U+2019>s over. Wake up,<U+201D> the ad said. In fact, many congressional Democrats were enthusiastic supporters of the passive-loss change, too, as a way of correcting what was widely perceived as an overreaction in the 1986 act. For his part, Mr. Trump appears to have spread around contributions to players on both sides of the debate. He was a fundraiser for Mr. Bush during his successful run for president in 1988, but also gave to a number of congressional Democrats during the period. For example, he chipped in thousands of dollars to causes favored by then-House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, according to published reports at the time. In 1993, Mr. Trump was fined by federal elections officials for violating a Watergate-era law capping contributions to federal candidates and campaign committees at $25,000 a year. At the 1991 hearing, before a House Budget Committee task force on urgent fiscal issues, Mr. Trump made it clear to lawmakers that he preferred to go back to<U+00A0>the looser<U+00A0>loss rules of the early 1980s, despite criticism that they generated unfair windfall deductions for passive investors, and encouraged overbuilding as well as tax shelters. Mr. Trump acknowledged the problems, but insisted the benefits outweighed the harm. <U+201C>I think it<U+2019>s a rule that works<U+201D> in getting people to invest, Mr. Trump testified.<U+00A0>The liberal rule of the 1980s could be limited, if need be, he added, but <U+201C>right now, we don<U+2019>t need limits<U+2026>We need action.<U+201D>",

Yay! But even before that, Democrat operatives are working around the clock to skew the election results in any way they can. Today we present to you Democrat-run cities in America allowing illegal immigrants to vote in the upcoming election. Should illegal immigrant voting be legal? Wha<U+2026>??? \n<U+2018>Look at illegal immigrants voting all over the country,<U+2019> Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview, part of his ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential election. There<U+2019>s no evidence to support the Republican nominee<U+2019>s claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include non-citizens (illegal immigrants) . Trump Opposes Same-Day Voter Registration to Prevent Illegal Immigrants from Voting: \nThe latest is San Francisco , where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city<U+2019>s public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. <U+201C>One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn<U+2019>t have a voice,<U+201D> says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve had legal immigrants who<U+2019>ve had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.<U+201D> Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the <U+201C>broken immigration system in this country.<U+201D> Should Illegal Immigrants Be Allowed to Vote in US Elections? \nToday there are six jurisdictions in Maryland that let non-citizens (illegal immigrants) vote in local elections. Chicago allows them to take part in elected parent advisory councils but not to vote in school board elections. Four towns in Massachusetts have moved to allow noncitizen voting and are awaiting state approval. And in New York City, where non-citizens (illegal immigrants) make up 21 percent of the voting-age population, the city council is drafting legislation that would allow more than 1.3 million legal residents to take part in municipal elections. The city previously allowed non-citizens (illegal immigrants) to vote in school board elections, but that ended when New York<U+2019>s school boards were dissolved in 2002. Liberals Sign Petition to Allow Illegal Immigrants to Vote in 2016 Presidential Election: \nSan Francisco has tried in the past to grant noncitizens access to school board elections. A 2004 measure narrowly failed, with 51 percent voting against it. <U+201C>There was an opposition campaign at that time,<U+201D> Chiu says. He sponsored another ballot measure in 2010, which also failed. This time, Chiu says, he<U+2019>s hoping for a victory. So far he<U+2019>s seen no organized opposition: <U+201C>I think that<U+2019>s because of the ugly, anti-immigrant statements expressed by Donald Trump and his supporters.<U+201D> SHARE THIS ARTICLE",

Celebrities and millions of social media users have raised awareness about the situation in North Dakota, and now, the <U+201C>water protectors<U+201D> have earned support from another group: veterans. \nAccording to an article published by Business Insider that first appeared in Task and Purpose , a military-oriented news and culture site, two veterans are leading the charge in a show of dissent against the increasingly aggressive police. In the last several months, tensions have escalated as Natives and their allies have blocked the pipeline<U+2019>s construction, citing fears surrounding water will be endangered and sacred burial sites will be destroyed (not to mention the fact their lands were forcibly stolen by the U.S. government over a century ago). \n<U+201C>This country is repressing our people, <U+201D> says Michael A. Wood Jr., a Marine Corps veteran who recently retired from the Baltimore police force to work toward reforming law enforcement. <U+201C> If we<U+2019>re going to be heroes, if we<U+2019>re really going to be those veterans that this country praises, well, then we need to do the things that we actually said we<U+2019>re going to do when we took the oath to defend the Constitution from enemies foreign and domestic ,<U+201D> he asserted about his plans to go to Standing Rock. \nWoods Jr. is joined by Wes Clark Jr. Clark Jr. is the son of General Wesley Clark, the famous military leader who once warned that shortly after 9/11, the government had its eyes on Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran. Clark would later attempt to distance himself from those statements but still managed to convince his son, a member of the Army at the time, to stay away from Iraq. \n<U+201C> I was like, <U+2018>I<U+2019>m going back in. I<U+2019>m going to go in there and fuck people up ,<U+2019><U+201D> Clark Jr. recalls of his desire to fight for the military after 9/11. He later changed his mind after his father warned him, as Task and Purpose summarized, <U+201C> that as a soldier he would be fighting a war that had nothing to do with defeating al Qaeda. <U+201D> \nNow, Wood Jr. and Clark Jr. are attempting to organize a mass, nonviolent protest against police action in North Dakota. Just this past weekend, a female protester was hit with a concussion grenade, causing severe damage to her arm and requiring surgery. \nOther have been tear gassed, tased, beaten, and shot with rubber bullets. Anti-Media journalist Derrick Broze was tased by law enforcement immediately after he declared he was a member of the media. Another journalist was shot with a rubber bullet while standing away from a gathering of protesters as she interviewed an attendee. \nPolice have made over 470 arrests since August, and the Indigenous Environmental Network claims 167 people were injured just this past Sunday when police deployed water cannons in freezing weather. Sign up for the free Anti-Media newsletter the establishment doesn't want you to receive \nClark, a contributor to the Young Turks, explained that aside from the flagrant violations protesters are subject to in North Dakota, Natives are especially deserving of veteran support: \n<U+201C> First Americans have served in the Unites States Military, defending the soil of our homelands, at a greater percentage than any other group of Americans. There is no other people more deserving of veteran support ,<U+201D> he said. \nAccording to a Facebook event the two men created called <U+201C>Veterans Stand for Standing Rock,<U+201D> those who join the effort will arrive at the protest site on December 4, where they will stay until December 7. \nThe event description reads: \n<U+201C> Come to Standing Rock Indian Reservation and hold the line with Wes Clark jr, Michael Wood Jr, Tulsi Gabbard and hundreds of other veterans in support of the Sioux nation against the DAPL pipeline. Bring Body armor, gas masks, earplugs AND shooting mufflers (we may be facing a sound cannon) but no drugs, alcohol or weapons . <U+201D> \nClark Jr. was clear he was not looking for violence and that the protest would be unarmed. \n<U+201C> We<U+2019>re not going out there to get in a fight with anyone, <U+201D> he said. <U+201C> They can feel free to beat us up, but we<U+2019>re 100% nonviolence .<U+201D> \nAs Task and Purpose explained: \n<U+201C> With an eye toward the media, old military uniforms will be donned so that if the veterans are brutalized by the police, they are brutalized not as ordinary citizens, but as people who once served the government they are protesting against. <U+201D> \nThe event page makes it clear that the group will not tolerate <U+201C> hate, violence or divisive behavior of any kind .<U+201D> \n<U+201C> We<U+2019>re doing this to support our country ,<U+201D> they advise, <U+201C> so let<U+2019>s do it with honor, working together. We can stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home. If not us, who? If not now, when? <U+201D> \nOver 250 veterans have already committed, but organizers hope to have a group of 500 or more by the time they head to Standing Rock. \nOnce there, the veterans intend to engage in a traditional native healing ceremony with protesters, with whom they have been coordinating, according to the veterans. Then, protective gear like gas masks and body armor will be issued to anyone who needs it. The soldiers will march to bagpipes and Sioux war songs as they head to the banks of the Missouri River to meet police. \n<U+201C> Then, the veterans and their allies <U+2014> or at least the ones who are brave enough <U+2014> will lock arms and cross the river in a <U+2018>massive line<U+2019> for their <U+2018>first encounter<U+2019> with the <U+2018>opposing forces. <U+2019><U+201D> \nThough the veterans have adopted a strict policy of nonviolence, they refuse to back down and apparently hope to use their military status to spotlight the egregious behavior of the police. \n<U+201C> We<U+2019>ll have those people who will recognize that they<U+2019>re not willing to take a bullet, and those who recognize that they are ,<U+201D> says Wood Jr. <U+201C> It<U+2019>s okay if some of them step back, but Wes and I have no intention of doing so .<U+201D> \nVeterans Stand for Standing Rock is accepting donations to cover food, transportation, and supplies for those who travel to North Dakota.

Today<U+2019>s story brings you a never-heard-before audio tape of then Sen. Clinton talking about rigging the elections in Palestine to ensure the outcome preferred by the United States government. \nVia NowEndBegins \n\nLooks like Crooked Hillary thinks nothing of rigging an election <U+2013> any election <U+2013> to suit her personal purposes. <U+201C>I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,<U+201D> said Sen. Clinton. <U+201C>And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.<U+201D>\nScroll Down For Video Below On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.\nThe tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audio cassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.\nThe tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton<U+2019>s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is <U+201C>rigged.<U+201D>\nSpeaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).\n<U+201C>I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,<U+201D> said Sen. Clinton. <U+201C>And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.<U+201D>\nCHOMSKY RECALLS BEING TAKEN ABACK THAT <U+201C>ANYONE COULD SUPPORT THE IDEA<U+2014>OFFERED BY A NATIONAL POLITICAL LEADER, NO LESS<U+2014>THAT THE U.S. SHOULD BE IN THE BUSINESS OF FIXING FOREIGN ELECTIONS.<U+201D> Some eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency.\nRegarding capturing combatants in war<U+2014>the June capture of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants who came across the Gaza border via an underground tunnel was very much front of mind<U+2014>Clinton can be heard on the tape saying, <U+201C>And then, when, you know, Hamas, you know, sent the terrorists, you know, through the tunnel into Israel that killed and captured, you know, kidnapped the young Israeli soldier, you know, there<U+2019>s a sense of like, one-upsmanship, and in these cultures of, you know, well, if they captured a soldier, we<U+2019>ve got to capture a soldier.<U+201D>\nEquating Hamas , which to this day remains on the State Department<U+2019>s official list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, with the armed forces of a close American ally was not what many expected to hear in the Jewish Press editorial offices, which were then at Third Avenue and Third Street in Brooklyn. (The paper<U+2019>s office has since moved to the Boro Park section of Brooklyn.) The use of the phrase <U+201C>these cultures<U+201D> is also a bit of a head-scratcher.\nAccording to Chomsky, Clinton was <U+201C>gracious, personable and pleasant throughout<U+201D> the interview, taking about an hour to speak to, in addition to himself, managing editor Jerry Greenwald, assistant to the publisher Naomi Klass Mauer, counsel Dennis Rapps and senior editor Jason Maoz.\nAnother part of the tape highlights something that was relatively uncontroversial at the time but has taken on new meaning in light of the current campaign<U+2014>speaking to leaders with whom our country is not on the best terms. Clinton has presented a very tough front in discussing Russia, for example, accusing Trump of unseemly ardor for strongman Vladimir Putin and mocking his oft-stated prediction that as president he<U+2019>d <U+201C>get along<U+201D> with Putin.\nChomsky is heard on the tape asking Clinton what now seems like a prescient question about Syria, given the disaster unfolding there and its looming threat to drag the U.S., Iran and Russia into confrontation.\n<U+201C>Do you think it<U+2019>s worth talking to Syria<U+2014>both from the U.S. point [of view] and Israel<U+2019>s point [of view]?<U+201D>\nClinton replied, <U+201C>You know, I<U+2019>m pretty much of the mind that I don<U+2019>t see what it hurts to talk to people. As long as you<U+2019>re not stupid and giving things away. I mean, we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years. They invaded Hungary, they invaded Czechoslovakia, they persecuted the Jews, they invaded Afghanistan, they destabilized governments, they put missiles 90 miles from our shores, we never stopped talking to them,<U+201D> an answer that reflects her mastery of the facts but also reflects a willingness to talk to Russia that sounds more like Trump 2016 than Clinton 2016.\nShortly after, she said, <U+201C>But if you say, <U+2018>they<U+2019>re evil, we<U+2019>re good, [and] we<U+2019>re never dealing with them,<U+2019> I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them<U+2026>So I would like to talk to you [the enemy] because I want to know more about you. Because if I want to defeat you, I<U+2019>ve got to know something more about you. I need different tools to use in my campaign against you. That<U+2019>s my take on it.<U+201D>\nA final bit of interest to the current campaign involves an articulation of phrases that Trump has accused Clinton of being reluctant to use. Discussing the need for a response to terrorism, Clinton said, <U+201C>I think you can make the case that whether you call it <U+2018>Islamic terrorism<U+2019> or <U+2018>Islamo-fascism,<U+2019> whatever the label is we<U+2019>re going to give to this phenomenon, it<U+2019>s a threat. It<U+2019>s a global threat. To Europe, to Israel, to the United States<U+2026>Therefore we need a global response. It<U+2019>s a global threat and it needs a global response. That can be the, sort of, statement of principle<U+2026>So I think sometimes having the global vision is a help as long as you realize that underneath that global vision there<U+2019>s a lot of variety and differentiation that has to go on.<U+201D>\nIt<U+2019>s not clear what she means by a global vision with variety and differentiation, but what<U+2019>s quite clear is that the then-senator, just five years after her state was the epicenter of the September 11 attacks, was comfortable deploying the phrase <U+201C>Islamic terrorism<U+201D> and the even more strident <U+201C>Islamo-fascism,<U+201D> at least when meeting with the editorial board of a Jewish newspaper.\nIn an interview before the Observer heard the tape, Chomsky told the Observer that Clinton made some <U+201C>odd and controversial comments<U+201D> on the tape. The irony of a decade-old recording emerging to feature a candidate making comments that are suddenly relevant to voters today was not lost on Chomsky, who wrote the original story at the time. Oddly enough, that story, headlined <U+201C>Hillary Clinton on Israel, Iraq and Terror,<U+201D> is no longer available on jewishpress.com and even a short summary published on the Free Republic offers a broken link that can no longer surface the story.\n<U+201C>I went to my bosses at the time,<U+201D> Chomsky told the Observer. <U+201C>The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody<U+2014>even a direct quote from anyone<U+2014>in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn<U+2019>t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.<U+201D>\n",

Our politicians and media have totally obscured the truth behind these and subsequent attacks that we call <U+2018>terrorism.<U+2019> While we mourn 9/11, US B-52 heavy bombers are raining bombs on what<U+2019>s left of Afghanistan in a futile attempt to crush tribal forces (aka Taliban) fighting western occupation. \nWe did the same thing in Laos in the 1980<U+2019>s, as President Barack Obama properly noted during his visit there last week. Laos has never recovered and Afghanistan won<U+2019>t either. \nSince 2015, the US has dropped at least 32,000 <U+2013> 1,000-2,000 lb. bombs on Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan and Afghanistan <U+2013> all Muslim nations.

We have never gotten the full story about 9/11. The best we can do is ask <U+201C>qui bono,<U+201D> who really benefitted from the attacks? \nThe 9/11 narrative was immediately twisted by President George Bush into a spurious claim that America had been attacked by Muslims because of its <U+2018>freedoms<U+2019> and her <U+2018>way of life.<U+2019> This deceit opened the Pandora<U+2019>s box from which issued the rising wave of Islamophobia and Crusading fever sweeping over the US and Europe. \nAmerica was attacked for what it had been doing all over the Muslim world, not for what it was. Most Americans don<U+2019>t know that the first CIA <U+2018>regime change<U+2019> in the Mideast occurred in Syria, way back in 1948. We<U+2019>re still at it today. \nEver since, the US, Britain and France <U+2013> the imperial three musketeers <U+2013> have been breaking and making regimes across the Mideast and Africa, and installing vicious dictators to do our bidding, earning enemies from West Africa to Tajikistan. \nHillary Clinton said this week that if elected president she would advance <U+2018>American exceptionalism<U+2019> and assure the new world order. These are code terms for imperialism and hegemony. If Clinton wins, look forward to foreign and military policy directed by Goldman Sachs and the neoconservatives. \nDonald Trump vows a major increase military spending at a time when America<U+2019>s infrastructure is rusting or collapsing and its debt soaring. Both Trump and Clinton warn of growing security threats to America from ISIS and North Korea. In reality, the greatest internal threat is the type of Saturday night gang shoot-outs in Chicago that have killed 500 people so far this year. \nISIS is a military pipsqueak <U+2013> a bunch of 20-something hooligans. North Korea only wants to be left alone to its misery. Washington, Paris, and London need the ISIS bogeyman today, just as they needed al-Qaida and the Soviet Union before, to justify budget-busting new arms spending and keeping the population whipped up with bogus war fever. \nInternationally, the greatest threat to America<U+2019>s security is, of course, nuclear armed Russia which has enough intercontinental and sea-launched missiles to wipe the United States off the map. Accordingly, Washington<U+2019>s most important foreign and national security priority is maintaining calm, well-mannered relations with Russia and its leadership. \nInstead, we have Hillary Clinton and her frantic war party neocons trying to provoke Russia at every turn and giving Moscow the impression that she will start a war with Russia. It was precisely such war talk and sabre rattling that in 1983 during the Able Archer crisis brought the US and USSR to within minutes of a full-scale nuclear war. \nFor all Trump<U+2019>s bluster and Islamophobia, he is absolutely right about seeking good relations with Moscow. The schoolyard demonization of Russian President Vladimir Putin by the Clinton camp and its tame US media is childish, shameful and unworthy of a great power.",

Then he often disregards their counsel, forging ahead in ways that his inner circle sometimes describes as politically imprudent. This year, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has sought to curtail the horse-carriage industry , escalated a fight with one of the city<U+2019>s most prominent newspapers and declined to release his emails with five longtime advisers who work outside of government<U+2014>all positions that many in his inner circle oppose. <U+201C>If he<U+2019>s convinced he<U+2019>s making the right decision, he won<U+2019>t back down,<U+201D> said Karen Hinton, a former press secretary to Mr. de Blasio who left the administration in June . <U+201C>Depending on your perspective, it<U+2019>s his best or worst quality.<U+201D> According to people close to him, Mr. de Blasio, 55 years old, often bristles when aides disagree with him, and some of them said they have never worked for a more stubborn person. Mr. de Blasio has told those close to him that they are giving him conventional wisdom or listening too much to his critics, these people said, and should instead focus on the <U+201C>mission,<U+201D> or what he calls his administration<U+2019>s work. Eric Phillips, who succeeded Ms. Hinton as press secretary, said Mr. de Blasio has a <U+201C>clear-eyed vision<U+201D> to improve the city. <U+201C>He won<U+2019>t compromise that mission by conforming to some outdated or past mayor<U+2019>s concept of the job,<U+201D> Mr. Phillips said. Earlier this month, Mr. de Blasio called the New York Post a <U+201C>right-wing rag<U+201D> and <U+201C>a negative presence in our city<U+201D> and declined to answer questions from the news outlet. Some of his advisers have winced at the fight, saying they don<U+2019>t believe Mr. de Blasio benefits from attacking the newspaper. The mayor has told allies that print media is fading, social media is rising and that people will agree with his criticisms of the Post. Asked for comment, a spokeswoman for the Post referred to the newspaper<U+2019>s front page earlier this month depicting the mayor as a baby crying in a high chair. The Post and The Wall Street Journal are both owned by News Corp. In September, two media outlets sued the mayor over his administration<U+2019>s decision not to release emails between Mr. de Blasio and five advisers. People close to Mr. de Blasio have recommended releasing the emails, but the mayor has doubled down, with aides and lawyers huddling at Gracie Mansion earlier this month to discuss fighting the lawsuit. <U+2018> If he<U+2019>s convinced he<U+2019>s making the right decision, he won<U+2019>t back down. <U+2019> The mayor<U+2019>s trip last winter to Iowa to campaign for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, even though he wasn<U+2019>t invited by Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign, was widely opposed by his advisers. Many of the mayor<U+2019>s allies disagreed with Mr. de Blasio<U+2019>s 2015 decision to delay his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton for six months. Mr. de Blasio told his allies he wanted to push Mrs. Clinton to the left and he coveted a bigger voice on the national stage. He said this month he had <U+201C>no regrets,<U+201D> even as leaked emails from Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign showed some of her aides were frustrated by the mayor<U+2019>s actions. This year, the mayor<U+2019>s aides mocked Mr. de Blasio<U+2019>s proposed limits on horse carriages, according to emails reviewed by the Journal. Even after the proposal fell through, Mr. de Blasio told aides he wanted to try to revive it, drawing resistance from some of his staff. On many mornings, Mr. de Blasio travels from Gracie Mansion on Manhattan<U+2019>s Upper East Side to a gym in Brooklyn, a 12-mile midmorning trip that has attracted protests and has become the subject of jokes around City Hall among people close to the mayor. Mr. de Blasio has said he has no plans to change his gym routine. Those close to Mr. de Blasio said the mayor<U+2019>s governing approach is deeply rooted in his experience working for former Mayor David Dinkins in the 1990s and his own come-from-behind victory in the 2013 mayoral race. Have something to say about an article in Greater New York? Email us, along with your contact information, at gnyltrs@wsj.com . Letters will be edited for brevity and clarity. Please include your city and state. Mr. de Blasio believes Mr. Dinkins was unfairly attacked as a liberal Democrat. In 2013, as a candidate for mayor, Mr. de Blasio shunned all sorts of advice as he floundered early on in the polls during the primary . Bill Hyers, Mr. de Blasio<U+2019>s 2013 campaign manager, said many people urged Mr. de Blasio to change course during the primary. But Mr. de Blasio <U+201C>stuck to his guns, stayed disciplined on the change and inequality message<U+201D> and ultimately won, Mr. Hyers said. To the dismay of some close to him, the mayor has said he isn<U+2019>t interested in attending events his predecessors have traditionally gone to<U+2014>such as parties in Manhattan<U+2014>if he doesn<U+2019>t believe they jibe with his ideological mission or if he disagrees with their corporate sponsors. <U+201C>Whether you like the mayor<U+2019>s politics or not,<U+201D> said Mr. Phillips, the mayor<U+2019>s spokesman, <U+201C>we think New Yorkers respect that he<U+2019>s not trying to be anything other than himself.<U+201D> Write to Josh Dawsey at joshua.dawsey@dowjones.com",

Monday said its practice of exempting its own streaming video services from data-usage caps for its wireless customers complies with the law and benefits consumers, in a response to concerns from a federal regulator. The Federal Communications Commission sent a letter to AT&T almost two weeks ago over worries the practice, known as zero-rating, <U+201C>may obstruct competition and harm consumers.<U+201D> <U+201C>These initiatives are precisely the kind of pro-consumer challenges to cable that the Commission heralded in approving AT&T<U+2019>s acquisition of DirecTV,<U+201D> wrote Robert Quinn, AT&T<U+2019>s policy chief, in a letter to the agency Monday. AT&T acquired satellite-TV operator DirecTV last year. The Dallas telecom giant, which agreed to buy Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion last month, began zero-rating its DirecTV video app in September. Mr. Quinn said nearly three million consumers used the app in the first four weeks after its launch. AT&T plans to offer the same treatment for its over-the-top service DirecTV Now launching this month. The FCC contends the practice could deter consumers from accessing existing and future mobile video services not affiliated with AT&T. The company has said that it offers any company that wants to be zero-rated the same payment terms available to DirecTV. An FCC spokesman said the agency is reviewing the response and declined to comment further. The agency sent the letter a day after President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s victory and last week Republican congressional leaders asked the FCC to stop taking controversial regulatory actions until the new administration is on board. That suggests that the FCC may not be able to take any further steps on the AT&T matter. While critics regard zero-rating as a way of skirting net-neutrality rules that require internet-service providers to treat all traffic the same, AT&T said it <U+201C>faithfully adhered<U+201D> to those rules in starting the program, which is <U+201C>consistent with decades of commission precedent.<U+201D> Mr. Quinn said any FCC position to the contrary would be a <U+201C>radical departure from established law.<U+201D> AT&T began allowing companies to pay for zero rating in 2014, but so far no major streaming providers have done so. Verizon Communications Inc. doesn<U+2019>t charge its customers for data for its National Football League games or its go90 mobile video app. T-Mobile US Inc. <U+2019>s <U+201C>Binge On<U+201D> program allows any video provider to be exempt from data caps without paying the carrier, although the video is delivered at lower quality. It also allows customers and content companies to opt out. <U+2014>John McKinnon contributed to this article. Write to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com",

        "input": "time: null \n author: noauthor \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/watch-out-for-terrors-first-incubators-1480008041 \n text: The Nov. 12 suicide bombing at a NATO air base outside Kabul, Afghanistan, which killed four Americans, should remind President-elect Donald Trump of the need for a decisive victory in Afghanistan against jihadist extremism. Although Afghanistan was barely mentioned during the recent campaign, it is where the 9/11 attacks were planned and where the U.S. first went to war to eliminate global terrorism waged in the name of Islam. While Islamic State in the Middle East constitutes a compelling threat, Afghanistan, with Pakistan, remains the world<U+2019>s most-active incubator of terrorism. It is also where the next administration must learn from the errors of the past. During the George W. Bush administration, from the end of 2001 through 2008, there were 625 U.S. military fatalities sustained during the Afghanistan combat mission known as Operation Enduring Freedom, according to the Defense Casualty Analysis System in the office of the Secretary of Defense. By the end of that period, when Barack Obama was elected president, al Qaeda was presumed to have been considerably weakened and its remnants forced to relocate to other countries. The Taliban, now operating from havens in Pakistan, were deemed an irritant, not a serious challenge to U.S. or global security. In hindsight, what happened next was a strategic miscalculation. The Obama administration initially increased the number of U.S. troops stationed in Afghanistan with a <U+201C>surge<U+201D> intended to bolster Afghanistan<U+2019>s security forces while sending a message to Pakistan to crack down on Taliban sanctuaries on its side of a porous border. But in the first of several mistakes, the additional troops were sent into Afghanistan with a withdrawal timeline for U.S. forces. This led the Taliban and their Pakistani backers to believe they could sit out Mr. Obama<U+2019>s deadline for leaving their region. So instead of forcing the Taliban into surrender, the withdrawal timetable led to their resurgence. During the six years from the beginning of 2009 to the end of 2014, when the Operation Enduring Freedom combat mission officially ended in Afghanistan, the Defense Department reported 1,761 American military fatalities<U+2014>more than double the number killed during seven years of the Bush administration. Another key mistaken belief was that the U.S. and NATO allies could train an Afghan army and other security forces within a few years before leaving the country. Afghan soldiers showed courage in fighting the Taliban, but they still needed competent and experienced commanders, which take decades to produce. For this plan to work would have required the retention of U.S. advisers, if not large numbers of American field fighters. For that reason alone, the December 2016 deadline set by Mr. Obama for withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan could not be met. Another presumption, inherited from the Bush administration, was that in dealings with Pakistan, incentives such as economic and military aid, and reimbursements for expenses incurred in fighting terrorists, would change Pakistan<U+2019>s strategic calculus from backing the Taliban. Yet nuclear-armed Pakistan sees itself very differently from how the world does. For the generals in Islamabad, and many civilian leaders, Pakistan<U+2019>s competition with India justifies breaking promises with the U.S. and continuing support for jihadist terrorism, from the Taliban to the Haqqani network, as part of its plans for regional influence to match India<U+2019>s. So $21 billion in funding under the Obama administration could not change Pakistan, just as $12.4 billion given to Pakistan under the Bush administration failed to shut down its terrorism incubators. Under President Obama, the U.S. did manage to hunt down Osama bin Laden in his safe house in Pakistan, without Pakistan<U+2019>s permission. The Trump administration will have to embrace similar unilateralism if and when needed, in addition to the almost inevitable downgrading of Pakistan from its current status as a major non-NATO ally. But getting Pakistan policy right<U+2014>including a review of the predicates for any aid<U+2014>remains the key to U.S. victory in Afghanistan. Until the rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan were the principal training grounds for Islamist terrorists. Virtually all of the al Qaeda terrorists convicted in Britain since 2001, including the July 7, 2005, London Underground bombers and Dhiren Barot, the so-called <U+201C>Dirty Bomber,<U+201D> got trained in Pakistan. Former French Investigating Magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguiere observed in his 2009 book, <U+201C>What I Could Not Say,<U+201D> that almost every terrorist apprehended by European security services over the last two decades has either studied and trained or passed through Afghanistan or Pakistan. Currently ISIS is vying with al Qaeda-linked groups for recruits in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The rise of global jihadism was made possible by America<U+2019>s preoccupation with current news while the Soviet bloc crumbled during the first couple of years of the 1990s. This time, the U.S. should not ignore the Afghanistan-Pakistan theater because the brutalities of ISIS, and its proximity to Europe, are the immediate cause of concern. Mr. Haqqani, the director for South and Central Asia at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C., was Pakistan<U+2019>s ambassador to the U.S. from 2008-11.",

In the past, the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. But they do not own Trump<U+2026> IMPORTANT: To find out which company the richest man in China has invested in, one that Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest investment opportunities in the world <U+2013> CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored \nMost likely you are unaware of what Trump is telling people as the media does not report it. A person who speaks like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYozWHBIf8g&app=desktop is not endeared to the oligarchs. \nWho are the oligarchs? \n<U+2014>Wall Street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the Federal Reserve, a federal agency that put 5 banks ahead of millions of troubled American homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. In order to save the mega-banks<U+2019> balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless. \n<U+2014>The military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power. \n<U+2014>The neoconservartives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China. \n<U+2014>The US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs. \n<U+2014>Agribusiness (Monsanto et.al.), corporations that poison the soil, the water, the oceans, and our food with their GMOs, herbicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, while killing the bees that pollinate the crops. \n<U+2014>The extractive industries<U+2014>energy, mining, fracking, and timber<U+2014>that maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply. \n<U+2014>The Israel Lobby that controls US Middle East policy and is committing genocide against the Palestinians just as the US committed genocide against native Americans. Israel is using the US to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in Israell<U+2019>s way. \nWhat convinces me that the Oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes<U+2019> reporting and the facts on the ground. \nAccording to the presstitutes, Hillary is so far ahead that there is no point in Trump supporters bothering to vote. Hillary has won the election before the vote. Hillary has been declared a 93% sure winner. \nI am yet to see one Hillary yard sign, but Trump signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Hillary<U+2019>s public appearances are unattended but Trumps are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida: <U+201C>Trump has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Trump signs and stickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Trump when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages.<U+201D> \nI know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity. \nI also receive from readers similar reports from around the country. \nThis is how the theft of the election is supposed to work: The media concentrated in a few corporate hands has gone all out to convince not only Americans but also the world, that Donald Trump is such an unacceptable candidate that he has lost the election before the vote. \nBy controlling the explanation, when the election is stolen those who challenge the stolen election are without a foundation in the media. All media reports will say that it was a run away victory for Hillary over the misogynist immigrant-hating Trump. \nAnd liberal, progressive opinion will be relieved and off guard as Hillary takes us into nuclear war. \nThat the Oligarchy intends to steal the election from the American people is verified by the officially reported behavior of the voting machines in early voting in Texas. The NPR presstitutes have declared that Hillary is such a favorite that even Republican Texas is up for grabs in the election. \nIf this is the case, why was it necessary for the voting machines to be programmed to change Trump votes to Hillary votes? Those voters who noted that they voted Trump but were recorded Hillary complained. The election officials, claiming a glitch (which only went one way), changed to paper ballots. But who will count them? No <U+201C>glitches<U+201D> caused Hillary votes to go to Trump, only Trump votes to go to Hillary. \nThe Matrix Of Lies <U+2013> America<U+2019>s False Reality The most brilliant movie of our time was The Matrix. This movie captured the life of Americans manipulated by a false reality, only in the real America there is insufficient awareness and no Neo, except possibly Donald Trump, to challenge the system. All of my life I have been trying to get Americans of all stripes<U+2014>academics, scholars, journalists, Republicans, Democrats, right-wing, left-wing, US Representatives, US Senators, Presidents, corporate moguls and brainwashed Americans and foreigners<U+2014>out of the false reality in which they exist. \nIn the United States today a critical presidential election is in process in which not a single important issue is addressed by Hillary and the presstitutes. This is total failure. Democracy, once the hope of the world, has totally failed in the United States of America. Trump is correct. The American people must restore the accountability of government to the people. \n***ALSO RELEASED: After Correctly Predicting GDP Would Beat Estimates, Former Soros Associate Now Says Gold Headed Above $2,000 CLICK HERE. \n<U+00A9> 2015 by King World News<U+00AE>.

Trump . But the year of outlandish politics is not limited to the top of the ticket. Consider these contentious, crazy and somewhat less consequential races. A tale of two Donalds, neither on the ballot The candidate is a self-funding billionaire and resort owner who vows to shake up the political establishment. He is accused of not paying taxes, and is not one to mince words. When his opponent ran an ad he did not like, he had this to say: <U+201C>That<U+2019>s complete dog snot!<U+201D> No, it is not Mr. Trump. The candidate is Jim Justice, a mining company executive and owner of the Greenbrier resort, now running as a Democrat for governor. And he is drawing unfavorable comparisons to a second Donald: Donald Blankenship, his fellow West Virginia coal baron. Like Mr. Blankenship, convicted this year of violating mine safety standards, Mr. Justice has also been accused of shoddy mine management. An investigative report by National Public Radio described him as <U+201C>the nation<U+2019>s top mine safety delinquent,<U+201D> and also found his companies owed $15 million in delinquent taxes and mine safety penalties <U+2014> allegations a spokesman for Mr. Justice dismissed as the product of <U+201C>the political silly season.<U+201D> Despite all of this, The Charleston Gazette endorsed him over Bill Cole, the Republican candidate and the president of the State Senate. But it was hardly a ringing endorsement. It called Mr. Justice <U+201C>the best of a questionable lot.<U+201D> Do you like your Tea (Party) organic? When is a Tea Party candidate not a Republican? When he runs as a Democrat. Pennsylvania<U+2019>s Ninth Congressional District, in the central and southwestern part of the state, has long been a safe Republican seat. Bud Shuster held it from 1973 to 2001; his son, Bill, has held the seat since then. That is more than four decades of single-family Republican control. Some members of the party <U+2014> including Art Halvorson, a retired Coast Guard captain who calls himself a <U+201C>conservative Christian, Tea Party-backed Republican<U+201D> <U+2014> are unhappy about this. Mr. Halvorson lost to Mr. Shuster in a primary, but 1,069 ticked-off voters wrote his name in on the Democratic side. So the Tea Party Republican is the Democratic nominee. <U+201C>I call it organic because I didn<U+2019>t even ask for it,<U+201D> Mr. Halvorson said , after the primary<U+2019>s surprise. Voters are confused. <U+201C>Some of Halvorson<U+2019>s own voters may abandon him, because they can<U+2019>t stomach voting for a Democrat,<U+201D> said David Wasserman, who tracks House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. <U+201C>But he<U+2019>ll win some Democrats, who don<U+2019>t know he<U+2019>s a Tea Party candidate.<U+201D> Nine political lives, and counting A defense lawyer, Joseph D. Morrissey, 59, lost his law license for most of the 2000s after a series of reprimands and suspensions over ethics and conduct issues. And in 2014, Mr. Morrissey was sentenced to jail time <U+2014> he spent nights there for three months <U+2014> after having a sexual relationship with a teenager employed in his law office. The woman, now 20, became his wife. Mr. Morrissey, a former Virginia state lawmaker, is running for mayor of Richmond. He has been able to draw from a strong base of support among black and working-class voters, driven by his charisma and familiarity, and is a top contender in a crowded field. <U+201C>You start to say, my gosh, how does this guy keep coming out of the ashes?<U+201D> said Dan Palazzolo, a professor of political science at the University of Richmond. But accusations have piled up. Late last month, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that Mr. Morrissey was accused of exposing himself to a client of his law firm in February. (Mr. Morrissey said they exchanged <U+201C>flirtatious text messages<U+201D> but denied further impropriety.) And Democratic officials filed complaints against him over sample ballots mailed to voters by his campaign that seemed, erroneously, to suggest he is their preferred candidate. But Richmond<U+2019>s odd election rules could favor a candidate with localized support, which Mr. Morrissey has. A candidate must win five of the city<U+2019>s nine districts to declare victory on Election Day. If that does not happen, there is a runoff. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s astounding,<U+201D> Mr. Palazzolo said. <U+201C>He could be our mayor.<U+201D> 3.6 million YouTube views <U+2014> but how many votes? The wife of a candidate for county commissioner in Travis County, Tex., looked at the camera dryly as her husband nattered incessantly about details of county policy. <U+201C>Please re-elect Gerald<U+201D> to get him out of the house, pleaded Charlyn Daugherty. <U+201C>Please.<U+201D> It was a wink at the wonkiest kind of public service, and the video garnered millions of views on YouTube and Facebook, marking a surreal turn for an obscure local race. It was a strategic gambit for a down-ballot Republican in unfriendly territory, since Travis County, which contains Austin, is reliably Democratic. Before the ad, <U+201C>even people who vote for him couldn<U+2019>t point him out of a crowd,<U+201D> said Brandon Rottinghaus, a professor of political science at the University of Houston. Mr. Rottinghaus said early voting in Travis County has already smashed its record from 2012. The question now is whether Democratic voters will cross party lines for Mr. Daugherty. But if he loses, he can still talk politics with (or at) his wife. <U+201C>You know,<U+201D> he says in the ad, as she rolls her eyes, <U+201C>I think I like helping around the house here.<U+201D> The millionaire and the ex-beauty queen After a wealthy venture capitalist moved to Indiana and immediately began running for Congress, the big question echoed from The Indianapolis Star newspaper , like a rhyming couplet from Dr. Seuss: <U+201C>And, by the way, who is this new Hoosier who calls himself Trey?<U+201D> The new Hoosier is Joseph Albert <U+201C>Trey<U+201D> Hollingsworth III, 33, who grew up in Tennessee and is worth at least $58 million, according to the newspaper. Last year, he moved to Jeffersonville, Ind., and began lending himself nearly $2 million to run for the open seat in the reliably Republican Ninth District. Mr. Hollingsworth prevailed over a crowded field of primary opponents and is now up to $2.77 million in total loans. He faces Shelli Yoder, a former Miss Indiana and current council member in Monroe County, Ind., for the general election. The partisan demographics may help Mr. Hollingsworth, but Ms. Yoder has made it a close race by playing up the carpetbagger theme. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s a Hoosier District,<U+201D> reads Ms. Yoder<U+2019>s website, <U+201C>and it can<U+2019>t be bought.<U+201D> A gloves-off race It was a normal Beast Fest in Bladenboro, N.C.: The car show, the craft vendors, the Howl-O-Ween dog costume contest. But, the festival, as the local paper put it , <U+201C>brought out the beast in two attendees.<U+201D> The attendees in question? The Democrat, Tim Benton, and the Republican, Brenden Jones, running for the State House<U+2019>s 46th District, whose encounter ended in claims of fisticuffs. <U+201C>He sucker-punched me in the face,<U+201D> Mr. Jones told WLOX . Mr. Jones, who believes his opponent was angry about an advertisement comparing him to Mrs. Clinton, filed a criminal summons against Mr. Benton. Mr. Benton said he was falsely accused, and accused Mr. Jones in turn: <U+201C>He assaulted me, and I defended myself.<U+201D> No matter who wins their race, the two candidates could meet again <U+2014> in court.

Kidman & Co. The BBHO consortium<U+2014>comprising the families of influential Australian outback ranchers Tom Brinkworth, Sterling Buntine, Malcolm Harris and Viv Oldfield whose interests span livestock, grain and transport<U+2014>said on Sunday it had secured financing to offer 386 million Australian dollars (US$294 million) for 100% of Kidman<U+2019>s shares in what would be one of the country<U+2019>s biggest agribusiness deals on record. A spokesman for the consortium said the bidders have notified the S. Kidman board of their intentions and plan to formally lodge the offer <U+201C>within the next few days.<U+201D> The all-Australian bid trumps a rival offer by Chinese property conglomerate<U+00A0>Shanghai CRED Real Estate Stock Co. and mining billionaire Gina Rinehart, who teamed up earlier this month offering A$365 million for the vast farming operation which straddles an area larger than Ireland. <U+201C>We have developed a compelling and superior proposal to that recently supported by the Kidman board which will see Kidman 100% Australian owned,<U+201D> said Sterling Buntine, the spokesman for the BBHO consortium. Mr. Buntine said the new offer, unlike the rival bid, wouldn't require approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board, which advises the Australian government on corporate takeover bids from abroad. The regulators and Treasurer Scott Morrison earlier this year blocked an offer for Kidman headed by a China-based consortium, which would have put 80% of the century-old cattle empire in Chinese hands. At the time, the government said the deal wasn 't in Australia<U+2019>s interest , in a signal of rising official concern about offshore investment in the country<U+2019>s agricultural trophies. The Kidman cattle empire includes the world<U+2019>s largest cattle ranch: Anna Creek Station, located beside a strategic missile range. Farm takeovers by overseas investors have become increasingly sensitive in Australia, with some politicians opposing deals they say represent threats to food and water security at a time of rising global demand. Investment by China<U+2014>now the biggest investor in Australia<U+2019>s agricultural sector<U+2014>has become especially contentious. The BBHO consortium said on Sunday it wants to preserve the heritage and brand name of Sidney Kidman, who is a national icon in Australia. With leases stretching across four states and an average herd size of 185,000 cattle, the Kidman business is Australia<U+2019>s biggest beef producer, exporting to the U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia. The landholding went on sale almost 18 months ago. Mr. Buntine said the Australian bidders intend to maintain and expand a Kidman-branded cattle marketing and export operation, representing the families<U+2019> combined herd which is in excess of 500,000 cattle. <U+201C>The Kidman story and legacy of Sir Sidney Kidman is in the DNA of our cattle industry,<U+201D> Mr. Buntine said. <U+201C>This initiative would more than treble the size of the herd currently marketed under the Kidman name.<U+201D> Surging Chinese investment in housing and trophy agriculture assets is triggering a backlash in major economies from Europe to the U.S., as well as Australia. The government has repeatedly stated the country<U+2019>s openness to foreign, and specifically Chinese, investment, but Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has faced pressure from within his conservative coalition and from fringe lawmakers to oppose any foreign farm takeovers. The government blocked last year an offer from Shanghai Pengxin Group Co. of China to buy Kidman outright, arguing that the deal covered too much land, which also overlapped the Woomera missile test range. In May, Treasurer Scott Morrison ruled that an offer from China-based Dakang Australia Holdings and Australian Rural Capital Ltd. was against the national interest. In August, Canberra blocked two rival bidders ,<U+00A0>from Hong Kong and mainland China, from taking a controlling stake in Ausgrid, the country<U+2019>s largest electricity network. The state government of New South Wales said Thursday that it had agreed to lease the Ausgrid network to two Australian pension funds for A$16 billion.

For 2016, the company now projects earnings per share of $6.33, adding to its previous guidance by two cents. It continues to expect sales to increase 6.3%. The Atlanta-based company has continued to report rising sales as the housing market grows and Americans become increasingly willing to spend on home-improvement projects. Superlow mortgage rates have kept higher prices within reach of many borrowers and prices have shot up in many U.S. housing markets over the past couple of years. But Donald Trump <U+2019>s victory has led to a surge in bond yields and, in turn, mortgage rates, potentially impacting housing prices . Mr. Trump has also made increasing infrastructure investments over the next decade one of his first priorities as president, potentially boosting companies like Home Depot. During the most recent quarter, sales at Home Depot stores open at least a year grew 5.5%. Analysts were expecting 4.5% growth. In all, Home Depot reported a profit of $2 billion, or $1.60 a share, up from $1.73 billion, or $1.35, a year prior. Revenue climbed 6.1% to $23.15 billion.

As expected, the Western corporate media and the Obama administration chose to ignore Vladimir Putin<U+2019>s explanation for Russia<U+2019>s stance on Syria and continued a number of policies that have completely exacerbated the conflict. \nIn a live interview with RT in June 2013, Putin was asked for an explanation regarding Russia<U+2019>s support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria, even though this support has made some people very angry at Russia. Putin<U+2019>s response was that Russia does not support the Assad government or Assad himself, but before defining Russia<U+2019>s official position, he explained what Russia does not want to do within Syria or across the Middle East: \n<U+201C>We do not want to interfere into the internal schism of Islam, between Shias and Sunnis. These are internal issues of the Islamic world. We have very good relations with much of the Arabic world, Iran for example, and others.<U+201D> \nHowever, according to Putin, what worries Russia can be identified by having a look <U+201C>at what is going on in the Middle East in general.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>Egypt is not calm. Iraq is not calm <U+2013> and it is not assured in its continued existence as one state. Yemen is not calm; Tunisia is not calm. Libya is witnessing inter-ethnic, inter-tribal conflict. So the entire region has been engulfed, at a minimum, into a state of conflict and undecidedness. And now Syria, down the same path.<U+201D> \nIn Putin<U+2019>s eyes, these events are no accident. As he puts it, these events happened for a reason: \n<U+201C>Some people, from the outside, think that if they can <U+2018>comb<U+2019> the region to how they see fit <U+2013> some of them call this <U+2018>democracy<U+2019><U+2013> then the region will come into calmness and order. That<U+2019>s not how it is. Without taking into account the history, the traditions, religious particularities, you must not do anything in the Middle East, especially as an outsider.<U+201D> \nRussia found this out the hard way when its military intervened in Afghanistan in the 1980s, a war many historians believe to be one of the main reasons for the fall of the Soviet empire. According to Robert Gates , director of the CIA under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and Secretary of Defense under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, the U.S. began arming and funding jihadists in Pakistan and Afghanistan six months prior to the Soviet invasion with the express goal of luring the Soviets into a quagmire. \nSimilarly, and not by accident, the tactic used to draw Russia into Afghanistan is the same tactic being used today in Syria. In fact, Obama warned Putin that Russia<U+2019>s adventures into Syria would result in the same quagmire the Soviets met in Afghanistan. \nUnsurprisingly, supporting radical militant groups to overthrow regimes in the Middle East has been a key hallmark of Obama<U+2019>s foreign policy. As Putin notes: \n<U+201C>So they interfered in the internal affairs of Libya. Whether the [Gaddafi] regime was good or bad <U+2013> but Libya used to have the highest standard of living in the Middle East. And what<U+2019>s happening there now? There<U+2019>s a war for resources; an endless inter-tribal war. How is this all going to end <U+2013> nobody knows.<U+201D> \nWhat happened to Libya resonated strongly with Russia due to the fact that in that situation, the West convinced Russia and China not to use their veto power at the U.N. Security Council level <U+2014> they were told regime change was not part of NATO<U+2019>s agenda in Libya. As it turned out, however, this was one of the first things that happened as soon as authorization was granted for NATO to bomb Libyan territory. Putin immediately questioned why NATO was attacking Muammar Gaddafi directly despite their promises they would not do so. \nPutin has therefore drawn the following conclusion: \n<U+201C>What worries us is that if the same is done in Syria, then it will be in the same state as Libya. Is it not enough that we already have a small lawless territory between Afghanistan and Pakistan? Nobody governs the area, it<U+2019>s just groups of rebels. This is very close to our borders, do we want another?<U+201D> \nThe role of al-Nusra in the Syrian conflict continues to be the main issue today, as Russia has repeatedly asked for the United States to differentiate between terrorist groups and moderate groups on the ground in Syria. \nAs Putin said: \n<U+201C>You know what [the Americans] can<U+2019>t answer us? The key armed opposition group<U+2026>al-Nusra<U+2026>Yes, this organization is one of the key ones in the armed opposition [against Assad].

President Obama has answered that question. \nAs reported by Agence France Presse, during a recent speech in Pittsburgh he postulated: \n<U+201C>We are going to have to rebuild within this wild-wild-west-of-information flow some sort of curating function that people agree to. \n<U+201C>There has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard, because they just don<U+2019>t have any basis in anything that<U+2019>s actually happening in the world.<U+201D> \nSet aside the outrageous, un-American gall in proposing that any central authority should <U+201C>curate<U+201D> information put out to the public, and walk with me for a minute down a meandering path of speculation. \nIt is, or course, the World Wide Web in which Obama<U+2019>s informational <U+201C>wild-wild west<U+201D> exists. This is the realm of Breitbart, Cybercast News Service, the Drudge Report , World Net Daily , American Thinker , and other non-establishment outlets that persist in making the president uncomfortable. \nAnd what has happened recently to affect the World Wide Web? The U.S. government has handed over control to ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), the nonprofit agency that assigns website domain names. \nIs it in the president<U+2019>s mind that ICANN might someday assume the <U+201C>curating function<U+201D> he sees as necessary to insure <U+201C>truthiness<U+201D> in web-based news reporting? \nWell, according to ICANN Board Chair Stephen D. Crocker, diverse membership in the organization makes such a thing unthinkable. Quoted by the tech site C/NET, Crocker said: \n<U+201C>This community validated the multistakeholder model of internet governance. It has shown that a governance model defined by the inclusion of all voices, including business, academics, technical experts, civil society, governments and many others is the best way to assure that the internet of tomorrow remains as free, open and accessible as the internet of today.<U+201D> \nHis confidence is echoed by the Internet Governance Coalition, a group of technology firms that includes Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Verizon, among others. They issued a statement that lauds ICANN<U+2019>s <U+201C>strong accountability measures<U+201D> and upholds <U+201C>the bottom-up approach that embodies the very nature of the open internet we experience today.<U+2026><U+201D> \nPardon the skepticism to which I<U+2019>ve become increasingly prone, but this sounds very much like the <U+201C>collaborative<U+201D> concept of governance that prevails in the academic world. \nIf you<U+2019>ve ever applied for a position at a college or university, you know that what a search committee wants most urgently to know about you is whether you have a <U+201C>collaborative style<U+201D> of working. \nWhat exactly is a <U+201C>collaborative style,<U+201D> as understood in today<U+2019>s academic world? It means that you won<U+2019>t do anything to contradict the orthodoxy in thought and procedure reigning on campus <U+2014> in other words, that you are <U+201C>politically correct<U+201D> in your outlook.",

In its <U+201C>wild habitat<U+201D> you could be forgiven for simply thinking that it was a tar-like substance. oozing from the cracks in between rocks high up in the Himalayan Mountains. And the locals did for many thousands of years; however, in ancient times one had to look for clues from nature to better understand their natural habitat<U+2014>particularly what was safe and what was poison. Upon seeing packs of native chimps snacking on the Shilajit tar and further observing that those who did seemed to be the strongest, most intelligent and long-lived of the bunch, the indigenous people began ingesting the night-black mineral pitch themselves. When they too began experiencing the benefits:<U+2014>a rapid restoration of their health and enhanced cognitive and physical abilities<U+2014>they knew they had stumbled on a great discovery. Oral tradition has it that this is how Shilajit was originally discovered. Maybe so, maybe not, but either way decades of intense scientific analysis and study have revealed that Shilajit is one of the most nutrient-dense substances on the planet. And what<U+2019>s more, is that the nutrients it contains, such as naturally occurring humic and fulvic acids<U+2014>two of nature<U+2019>s most potent detoxifiers of heavy metals and other pollutants that disrupt the natural function of the body, and are quite rare to boot. Known euphemistically as the <U+201C>destroyer of weakness,<U+201D> much can be learned about the incredible properties and benefits of Shilajit by understanding the process of how it is created. Over the course of millions of years, the lush primeval vegetation that once blanketed Asia was decomposed by the forces of nature, eventually becoming highly compacted under the weight of the mountains, which later formed as continental plates collided. Over 6,500 different species of ancient plants spent many millennia in a sort of geological alchemy that created a thick, black, resin-like substance trapped deep within the Himalyan, Caucasus, and other famous mountain ranges in the region. The relentless monsoons and ever-increasing pressure eventually caused this <U+201C>tar<U+201D> to begin seeping from cracks in rocks in the sides of the mountains. <U+201C>Intense scientific analysis and study have revealed that Shilajit is one of the most nutrient-dense substances on the planet.<U+201D> Laboratory analysis of Shilajit reveals a complete spectrum of every essential mineral on the planet in ionic form<U+2014>the most easily absorbable and assimilated by the human body. Scientists also found amino acids, fulvic and humic acids, ellagic acid, fatty acids and plant sterols, which tend to have a harmonizing effect on the hormonal/endocrine system, among many others. purified ladakhi shilajit resin from a tenth-generational family of herbal alchemists, considered by many to be some of the world<U+2019>s best shilajit. it can be cut with a knife and is similar in texture to a hard candy, although more pliable. photo: lerina winter Although shamans and medicine men of the time could not possibly have understood its complex and unusual composition, they could easily discern the beneficial effects Shilajit was having on the people they treated, which was a massive restoration of health and wellbeing. The Benefits of Shilajit Shilajit acts on many different systems in the body, earning it a place among the prized natural medicines known as adaptogens, meaning it helps to restore balance to one<U+2019>s system, whether that is through reducing excess (stress and cortisol, for example) or nourishing deficiencies (promoting sound sleep and giving endurance, strength and stamina) within the body<U+2019>s various systems. One of the primary ways it does this is through its action on the endocrine system. As the master controllers of the body<U+2019>s thousands of delicately tuned processes, hormones<U+2014>or the lack thereof<U+2014>have a very large influence on your health. They control mood, libido, sleep-wake cycles, hair growth, cognition, energy, consciousness and much more. Therefore it should come as no surprise that Shilajit has long been valued for its ability to restore sexual function, promote cognitive abilities, reduce anxiety and stress, improve mood and generally extend one<U+2019>s lifespan. Quite impressive, to be sure. However, Shilajit<U+2019>s beneficial medicinal properties are not solely limited to the endocrine system. It has also been shown to reduce pain and inflammation, making it one of the most sought after remedies for those suffering from arthritis. It also has a healing effect on the digestive tract, with the notable ability to repair ulcerated intestines and keep harmful bacteria in check. And, of course, it is also a great remineralizer and detoxifier, removing heavy metals and replacing them with those the body needs for health and wellbeing. It has also been used to treat allergies, malnutrition, anemia, and broken bones. It<U+2019>s kind of like water: life is just better when you consume it regularly. Selecting Quality Shilajit Shilajit can be found seeping wildly in many mountain ranges across Asia, although each culture tends to have its own name for the substance. In Western and Central Asia it is typically referred to as Moomiyo, but in the areas in and around the Himalayas, it is referred to as Shilajit. While this may seem semantical, it is an important distinction due to the fact that, depending on the source, Shilajit/Moomiyo will have different compositions. Generally speaking, the best quality Shilajit is believed to originate from the Himalaya area. shilajit is harvested in remote regions of the himalayan mountains. However, because Shilajit is somewhat rare and difficult to collect, as well as the fact that the world<U+2019>s supply originates in developing countries, the quality varies widely in the products currently available through various health food stores and websites worldwide. The most sought after and rare form is the night-black mineral resin, with only a handful of companies selling it worldwide. It is a sticky, wet-looking <U+201C>tar<U+201D> that is an intensely concentrated and purified form of Shilajit. It can be pricey, although a little goes a long way, making even a small amount last for months, even at higher dosages. That being said, there are many excellent, more affordable Shilajit products that come in a powdered form<U+2014>though they will generally be slightly less concentrated and potent than the pure resin. The primary benefits of the powder are the ease of use, price, and the ability to measure precise amounts, if needed, as the resin itself is quite sticky. When using a powder discernment is needed, as not all brands are equal. (In the section that follows we recommend some high quality, potent and high integrity Shilajit powders that are not adulterated). The vast majority of products available worldwide are actually diluted Shilajit powders. Pure Shilajit resin is composed of approximately 2% to 10% naturally occurring humic and fulvic acids with the remaining portion composed of minerals and other medicinal substances. However, adulterated products are typically 10% to 30% actual Shilajit powder and about 70% to 90% extracted humic and fulvic acids, which can be produced cheaply in a lab and added afterwards. While not dangerous, the adulterated Shilajit powders do not posses the same powerful medicinal properties. Authentic, quality Shilajit always has a distinct, strong piercing tar-like odor that is unmistakable. If the product you have does not have a noticeably intense smell or seems <U+2018>faint<U+2019>, then it is likely old or diluted Shilajit. Shilajit is not grown like most herbs and foods, so there are no organic or conventional distinctions. If authentic and unadulterated, Shilajit is wildcrafted, which is truly what lends it such incredible healing properties. source:",

It has nothing to do with the legal age we can drink, or drive a car, or get married, and it<U+2019>s not signified by the job we have or the car we drive. It<U+2019>s a state of mind, a way of operating in the world.\nBeing a pretty well behaved teen, I often had people tell me from as young as 13 that I was incredibly mature for my age. In some respects, I could not argue with them. I would look at the behaviour of many of my friends and quite easily distinguish that I, for the most part, handled many things far more <U+201C>responsibly<U+201D> than they did. But even now, at the ripe old age of 28, I question when and if I ever truly matured.\nI may have always acted appropriately, taken school seriously, and respected those around me, but did that qualify me for full-blown adulthood? I certainly thought it did, until about a year ago, when I concluded that the true sign of maturity is when an individual takes full responsibility for their life.\nAs part of identifying this conclusion (which I know is entirely subjective), I<U+2019>ve reflected a lot on what comes with this fundamental step in life. Here is my list of 7 seemingly harsh realities that kick in when you decide to take full responsibility for your life :\n1. The World Doesn<U+2019>t Revolve Around You As much as we may like to think it does, the truth is, we are but a tiny fish in a massive soup of collective consciousness. Does this mean that we are ultimately powerless to create anything that will impact the masses? Absolutely not. But it does mean that we can no longer expect the world to cater to us.\nLong gone are the days when parents, teachers, or any other caregiver is going to sit us down and remind us that everything is going to be okay. We need to find that strength within ourselves and go against the grain to create whatever it is that we are passionate about.\n2. Your Reactions Are Everything In the moment, things may happen to us <U+2014> some far more challenging, scary, or unwanted than others <U+2014> but regardless of what that thing is, it<U+2019>s our reaction to it that dictates how much it is going to impact our lives.\nFor example, there is nothing intrinsically insulting about being called an asshole <U+2014> we can choose to take it personally, or we can choose to let it roll off our backs. This is why some of us are able to let it go in one ear and out the other while carrying on with our day, while others take it as a punch to the gut and a reason to change their behaviour moving forward.\n3. We Can<U+2019>t All Be Famous We live in a time when instant fame has never seemed more attainable. The laughing mom in the chewbacca mask is all the evidence we need of this phenomenon. But fame still isn<U+2019>t in the cards for all of us.\nWhile I<U+2019>m not suggesting that we stop trying to achieve success, or even that kind of astonishing overnight success, it seems that with maturity we recognize it<U+2019>s not only not worth pinning our hopes on, but also not really that desireable.\n4. We<U+2019>ve Been Distracting Ourselves a Lot We all have things to do <U+2014> emails we avoid writing, conversations we avoid having, and issues we avoid addressing <U+2014> yet we consistently choose to distract ourselves instead. Whether it be by glorifying how <U+201C>busy<U+201D> we are, or by choosing to turn to Netflix instead, part of taking responsiblity for our lives is acknowledging our tendency to distract ourselves.\nThe more we acknowledge it, the more uncomfortable it becomes, and eventually, it will become so uncomfortable that we finally decide to just take action, and wonder why we didn<U+2019>t do it before.\n5. Haters Gonna Hate Even if you go out of your way to be a people pleaser (which I would never suggest), there will always be someone or many someones who do not support you. While this is certainly the case throughout all of our lives, it usually isn<U+2019>t until we enter maturity that we acknowledge this as not only common but acceptable.\nIn the end, it<U+2019>s far better to be your true self and let some people hate that, than change who you are and have a bunch of different people hate you anyways.\n6. Blaming Doesn<U+2019>t Get You Anywhere <U+201C>He/she did it!<U+201D> It<U+2019>s the infamous line we<U+2019>ve heard so many children say while pointing their finger in the direction of the person they believe should take the fall for whatever happened.\nIt may have worked, on occasion, throughout our childhood, but part of taking responsibility for your life is actually, you know, taking responsibility for your life . As much as we may feel like victims to certain things, playing the victim card rarely gets us anywhere and instead tends to prolong whatever situation or conflict we<U+2019>re trying to escape.\n7. You Are the Reason Why You Aren<U+2019>t Where You Want to Be This one certainly goes hand in hand with the one before it, and is equally as true. If you want to own a multi-million dollar company that earns money for you even while you sleep, you have to start it and stick with it!\nYour life is what it is right now because of the collection of decisions you<U+2019>ve made up to this point. So now is as good a time as any to start making ones that align with what you actually want. You just need to make sure you<U+2019>re tough enough to handle the fears, challenges, and emotions that are bound to come along the way, and remember, no matter how hard things get, <U+201C>this too shall pass.<U+201D>\nA book that I found to be particularly helpful in me taking full responsibility for my life was Tony Robbins<U+2019> Awaken the Giant Within : How to Take Immediate Control of Your Mental, Emotional, Physical and Financial Destiny! \n",

Dianne Feinstein called the FBI's actions \"appalling.\"  | Getty Republicans are also rethinking their opinion on the FBI director. By Daniel Strauss 10/28/16 08:18 PM EDT Democrats have soured on James Comey. In July, they praised the FBI director's decision not to recommend charges against Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. But on Friday, top party officials turned on Comey <U+2014> ripping him not only for taking new steps into an investigation they hoped was over, but also for the way he announced them. Story Continued Below Comey sent a letter to several congressional leaders to inform them that the FBI had come across new emails pertinent to its Clinton investigation and would take additional steps to look into them, adding that the FBI did not yet know if the emails were significant and that he did not yet know when the additional review would be finished. The letter set off a political firestorm. And while Republicans pounced, Democrats fumed. <U+201C>Already, we have seen characterizations that the FBI is 'reopening' an investigation but Comey's words do not match that characterization,<U+201D> Clinton campaign manager John Podesta wrote in a statement. <U+201C>Director Comey's letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant.<U+201D> By Josh Gerstein and Madeline Conway Podesta also expressed frustration at the timing of the letter from Comey to lawmakers, informing them of the new evidence. \"It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,<U+201D> he wrote. <U+201C>The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining. We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July.\" And Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, took perhaps the strongest shot at Comey: \"The FBI has a history of extreme caution near Election Day so as not to influence the results. Today<U+2019>s break from that tradition is appalling.\" Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, was also displeased: \"Frankly, I was surprised that the FBI sent this letter given how obvious it was that Republicans would immediately misconstrue and mischaracterize it. The FBI Director did explain in his letter that none of this information may even be significant, but that did not stop Republicans from hyperventilating and making wild accusations. I can understand the FBI's concern about being attacked for not keeping Republicans informed of any possible development --no matter how small--but I believe the FBI now has an obligation to make public as much information as possible as soon as possible to eliminate any inaccuracies or confusion about these issues.\" But in July, Democrats had warmer things to say about Comey when he decided not to bring charges against Clinton and her staff. Cummings, at a House Oversight Committee hearing in July, lavished praise on Comey in the face of strong criticism from Republicans. 2016 By Annie Karni \"I don't know whether your family's watching this, but I hope that they are as proud of you as I am, because you are the epitome of what a public servant is all about. Sacrificing over and over and over again, trying to do the right thing, sometimes coming under ridicule, but again still doing the right thing,\" Cummings said. Similarly, after Comey announced that he would not call for Clinton to be prosecuted over the secret email server in July, Feinstein praised the director for coming to the \"proper\" conclusion. \"After months of painstaking work, FBI Director Comey today announced that charges against Secretary Clinton for her use of a private email server would not be appropriate and that <U+2018>no reasonable prosecutor<U+2019> would pursue a case,\" Feinstein said in a statement on July 5. <U+201C>While Secretary Clinton admitted the private server was a mistake, it<U+2019>s clear there was no intent to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, so this is the proper conclusion.\" But it's not just Democrats who changed their perspective on Comey after his agency's moves Friday. One Donald Trump, perhaps the greatest beneficiary of the decision, seemed to warm to an official who had previously ranked among his favorite foils. At a rally in July, after Comey did not recommend charges, Trump criticized Comey's decision and told supporters: \"We have a rigged system, folks.\" But at a rally Friday, the day's news seem to have changed Comey's stance. \"The FBI, I think they<U+2019>re going to right the ship, and they can save their great reputation by doing so,<U+201D> Trump told rally attendees in New Hampshire. <U+201C>It might not be as rigged as I thought.\" By Michael Grunwald By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz",

Charles Schumer. A veteran deal maker and famously nonstop political strategist, Mr. Schumer is expected to be elected by his colleagues on Wednesday to replace retiring Minority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) In his new post, Mr. Schumer will assume command of the Senate wing of a party contending not only with a White House soon held by Mr. Trump, a Republican, but also Democrats<U+2019> own internal divisions, which could be reinforced by their losses in this week<U+2019>s election. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s stunning victory, fueled by a wave of discontent with the political status-quo, is expected to empower Democrats<U+2019> liberal wing, whose skepticism of trade deals and Wall Street shared some overlap with Mr. Trump<U+2019>s populist message. Longtime liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), who enthralled many of the party<U+2019>s younger voters in the Democratic presidential primary, will likely have new sway in Democrats<U+2019> internal deliberations. <U+201C>If we have learned nothing else from the past two years of electioneering, we should hear the message loud and clear that the American people want Washington to change,<U+201D> Ms. Warren said in a speech Thursday. <U+201C>The American people have called out loudly for economic and political reform. For years, too many Republicans and too many Democrats have refused to hear their demands.<U+201D> Mr. Schumer, in an interview this week, played down the party<U+2019>s divisions, saying that House Republicans<U+2019> internal strife has blocked more legislative action than Democrats<U+2019> disagreements. <U+201C>Our party is far less divided than the Republicans,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We have some differences in our caucus, but they don<U+2019>t prevent us from being unified and getting things done.<U+201D> Mr. Schumer, whose New York constituents include many in the financial industry, may be reluctant to let the party<U+2019>s liberal wing pull its policy too far to the left. Many of the more centrist Senate Democrats will be up for re-election in 2018<U+2014>including Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana<U+2014>and defending them is likely to be a priority. <U+201C>There are a lot of Democrats who would have a really difficult time defending a progressive agenda,<U+201D> said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. <U+201C>They would seem out of step<U+201D> from their conservative-leaning states. In addition, Mr. Schumer has a long record as a savvy deal maker in the Senate, and Republicans will have new incentives to work across the aisle next year. In 2017 Republicans will control the House majority, but hold only 52 seats in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to pass most legislation. Democrats have been divided in the past over issues including energy regulations and how to overhaul the business tax code, topics that Republicans and Mr. Trump are likely to revisit next year. Bipartisan efforts to pare down environmental regulations won<U+2019>t sit well with the party<U+2019>s liberal wing. <U+201C>The challenge we face with global warming is equivalent to an asteroid aimed directly at the Earth,<U+201D> Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), the only senator to endorse Mr. Sanders during the primary race, said Thursday. In some ways, Mr. Schumer<U+2019>s job next year will be easier as the leader of the minority party in the Senate and one that doesn<U+2019>t control the White House. Had Democrats won the White House and Senate majority on Tuesday, Mr. Schumer would have been responsible for clearing Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s nominees through the chamber. Liberal groups were already bracing for a fight over potential cabinet appointments and other nominees they viewed as too cozy with Wall Street. That could have been tricky for Mr. Schumer, who has advocated for some legislation benefiting the financial industry, including the reauthorization of a federal terrorism insurance program important to real-estate developers in New York City. He also hasn<U+2019>t been as sharp a critic of banks as others in the party<U+2019>s left wing, not signing some letters written by Democrats after the Wells Fargo scandal over its sales tactics. The responsibility of passing legislation now rests on Republicans, who have pledged to repeal and replace the 2010 health-care law, the pitfalls of which have been a political albatross for Democrats. <U+201C>The burden on health-care policy shifts<U+201D> to Republicans, Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.). Instead of Democrats debating whether they could establish a government-run insurance option, known as the public option, he said, <U+201C>the fight is going to be about what they think will magically insure 20 million people other than the Affordable Care Act.<U+201D> Democrats said they hope to find some common ground with Mr. Trump, citing his campaign stances to improve the country<U+2019>s infrastructure and change the tax treatment of carried interest, private-equity managers<U+2019> share of profits from others<U+2019> investments. And Mr. Trump<U+2019>s split with Republicans on some fiscal issues<U+2014>he doesn<U+2019>t want to change or cut Social Security<U+2014>could align him with Democrats at times. But Democrats said they wouldn<U+2019>t hesitate to use their toehold of power in the Senate to block Mr. Trump if he tries to implement some of his more contentious campaign proposals, including building a wall along the border with Mexico or deporting all illegal immigrants. On these issues, Mr. Schumer is likely to face little internal disagreement. <U+201C>Where the Trump agenda is going to go after vulnerable people<U+2014>immigrants, Muslims, women, the poor<U+2014>he<U+2019>ll be able to unify the caucus and be the firewall between the worst of Trump<U+2019>s instincts and a compliant Republican Congress,<U+201D> said former Schumer aide Jim Kessler, a senior vice president at Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank.

By Alex Isenstadt , Kyle Cheney and Shane Goldmacher 10/10/16 07:29 PM EDT Updated 10/10/16 07:26 PM EDT With Donald Trump<U+2019>s campaign in a historic free fall, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus declared Monday that the party is standing behind its presidential nominee. <U+201C>First of all, I want to make it very clear that the RNC is in full coordination with the Trump campaign, and we have a great relationship with them. If there<U+2019>s any takeaway from this call, that<U+2019>s the takeaway,<U+201D> Priebus told RNC members during an emergency conference call, which POLITICO obtained a recording of. Story Continued Below <U+201C>Nothing has changed in regard with our relationship and we remain very much involved and together in all levels of making these decisions with how to run this operation across this country.<U+201D> <U+201C>Everything is on course,<U+201D> Priebus said. <U+201C>I want you to understand that.<U+201D> The call came amid mounting questions about whether the Republican Party was preparing to abandon Trump amid revelations that he had once bragged about sexually assaulting women. On Monday morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced that he would no longer defend Trump and would instead focus on protecting the majority in his congressional chamber. The announcement represented an extraordinary break as the highest-ranking elected Republican said he was no longer standing with the Republican nominee. Priebus spent much of the 14-minute call trying to defuse what he described as a series of false <U+201C>rumors<U+201D> from the weekend that the committee would be shifting its focus to down-ballot races. He dismissed talk that staffers had left the RNC and the Trump campaign, and said there had been no discussion of finding a new nominee <U+2014> something he described as impractical. <U+201C>There<U+2019>d been obviously in the last 24 hours, the last 36 hours, a lot of false rumors that we didn<U+2019>t want to engage in before the debate last night, which was very important,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>So here we are.<U+201D> Since the release of the bombshell 2005 tape, many RNC officials expressed frustration about not being able to get answers from the committee. Some of them said they spent the weekend trying to get in touch with RNC leaders but received <U+201C>radio silence.<U+201D> One party chair, Robert Graham of Arizona, offered a sharp criticism of the RNC on Monday <U+2014> pointing specifically to the committee<U+2019>s decision to temporarily halt over the weekend production of some political mail boosting Trump. <U+201C>Leadership is more than stopping political mail, not campaigning for someone or making statements condemning a person<U+2019>s comments made nearly a dozen years before,<U+201D> said Graham, who is expected to wage a campaign to be the next RNC chairman. <U+201C>Leadership is making the tough decisions, digging in and sacrificing for beliefs and ideas greater than one person.<U+201D> By Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan During the call, Priebus said he and Trump campaign officials had reached the conclusion that they wanted to let Trump explain the video without any <U+201C>cross-talk,<U+201D> which could have obscured the apology he planned to deliver during the debate. The chairman said Trump had demonstrated contrition on Sunday evening in St. Louis, delivering an apology that was <U+201C>heartfelt.<U+201D> <U+201C>I am happy that Donald apologized a few different times about it. He apologized to the American people, he apologized to his family,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>He was embarrassed, he was ashamed. And honestly, I can tell you it was very heartfelt because I<U+2019>ve seen it one on one with him over the weekend. And it wasn<U+2019>t something that wasn<U+2019>t just said at the debate. It<U+2019>s something that he feels, as Gov. [Mike] Pence says, in his heart.<U+201D> Priebus promised to update RNC members with another conference call in around a week.

Trump<U+2019>s positions on climate change amount to a declaration of war on young people like me. But millennials have a stronger position in this fight than it may first appear. There is no way to sugarcoat the consequences of what happened on Election Day. Mr. Trump is a disaster for the planet. His plan to <U+201C>cancel<U+201D> America<U+2019>s adherence to the Paris climate agreement and accelerate fossil fuel production threatens to destroy global momentum on climate change. At the international climate talks now taking place in Marrakesh, Morocco, American environmentalists cried upon learning of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory. <U+201C>Without U.S. action to reduce emissions and U.S. diplomatic leadership, implementation of Paris will surely slow,<U+201D> Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton, told The Associated Press . Keeping the increase in global warming to below two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), which most scientists believe is the tipping point for catastrophic changes to the earth<U+2019>s natural systems, <U+201C>would become impossible,<U+201D> Professor Oppenheimer said. Mr. Trump, who is 70 years old, probably won<U+2019>t live to see the deadly consequences of his policies. But if inaction does end up causing a sea level rise of several feet in as early as 50 years as feared by the climate scientist James Hansen and his colleagues in a recent study , many millennials will be forced to experience those consequences. By the time some of us are Mr. Trump<U+2019>s age, the study warns, <U+201C>conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization.<U+201D> I turned 30 a few months ago. I was in Paris last year for the historic climate agreement Mr. Trump now wants to abrogate. As I watched Mr. Trump win the presidency, I was tempted to abandon all the hope I<U+2019>d felt in France. He is ready to sacrifice my generation and all the others that will follow it for the limited, short-term economic payoff that comes with burning more fossil fuels. But I know something Mr. Trump doesn<U+2019>t, which lets me feel a glimmer of hope: People my age may be able to prevent him from making us pay for his mistakes. We have more power to stall, and perhaps defeat, his climate plan than our elders seem to be aware of. It<U+2019>s indisputable that the business case for fossil fuels is shrinking. The bankruptcy filing this year of Peabody Energy, the world<U+2019>s largest publicly owned coal producer, was but the latest terrible news for an industry whose market, Goldman Sachs says, is in a longterm and irreversible decline. Oil isn<U+2019>t doing much better. That industry<U+2019>s profit margins continue to be squeezed by low global prices. This month, Shell<U+2019>s chief financial officer predicted that oil demand could peak <U+201C>between five and 15 years<U+201D> from now (though other major oil companies say it will be decades later). A study this year from Bloomberg New Energy Finance argued gas demand could peak in less than a decade. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s repeated promises that he will return fossil-fuel workers to their old jobs is at odds with economic reality. It would be more realistic to retrain those workers for renewable energy, which expanded at its fastest-ever rate in 2015, according to the International Energy Agency. The fossil-fuel lobbyists advising Mr. Trump have no interest in that. But his administration can do only so much to resist these larger economic forces <U+2014> or the young people who are now accelerating them. That<U+2019>s why Mr. Trump<U+2019>s promise to lift restrictions on oil, gas and coal production within his first 100 days in office may not accomplish much. North America<U+2019>s oil and gas companies do need people to work for them, but not the aging workers of coal country Mr. Trump made central to his campaign. Those companies need young people. Many of the industry<U+2019>s skilled workers are reaching retirement, and millennials have no interest in replacing them. Industry research suggests that less than 20 percent of the workers in the oil and gas industry in the United States are young people. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s regarded as a dirty industry and there are some safety concerns, and it<U+2019>s just not seen as very sexy,<U+201D> Pavel Molchanov, an industry analyst, told the website Oilprice. If companies like Exxon can<U+2019>t reverse this trend, the oil and gas industries may find their $100 billion worth of new petrochemical projects severely threatened, Bloomberg concluded in 2013. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s <U+201C>drill, baby, drill<U+201D> approach seems unlikely to change young people<U+2019>s minds. Only 37 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds voted for him, according to exit polls , compared with 55 percent for Hillary Clinton. Millennials know that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s policies threaten their survival. Climate groups like 350.org, with large followings among young people, are now vowing to <U+201C>put everything on the line to protect the progress we<U+2019>ve made and continue to push for bold action.<U+201D> This includes an acceleration of fossil-fuel divestment, a campaign that began in 2012 on several dozen college campuses in the United States and has continued to gain steam since. Major financial players are paying attention. The Swiss banking giant UBS calls the movement a <U+201C>catalyst for change.<U+201D> For Mr. Trump to succeed with his destructive environmental policies <U+2014> and endanger my generation<U+2019>s future <U+2014> he will have to reckon with this profound generational shift. If millennials continue to reject careers in oil and gas, swell the ranks of the divestment movement and do everything we can to keep fossil fuels in the ground, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plan to repudiate the Paris agreement and expand drilling in the United States will become unfeasible. We are entering dark times, but with hope, creativity and effort, we don<U+2019>t have to let them define us. Geoff Dembicki is the author of the forthcoming <U+201C>Are We Screwed?

Once inside Syria, however, Turkish forces <U+2014> leading Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels <U+2014> took aim at Kurdish fighters in the town of Jarablus, which sent them scurrying across the Euphrates River in retreat. \nThe issue here is that the U.S. claims to find the Kurds useful in the fight against ISIS. The Kurds, in fact, make up a significant portion of one of the primary U.S.-supplied rebel forces in the region. As Reuters explains : \n<U+201C>Kurdish militia have played a big role in the past year in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed umbrella group, as it has seized large areas of territory from Islamic State, laying the ground for an assault on Raqqa. \n<U+201C>However, Turkey<U+2019>s intervention in Syria in August in support of rebel groups fighting under the Free Syrian Army (FSA) banner has complicated that equation, leading to clashes between them and Kurdish groups allied to the SDF.<U+201D> \nThe problem is one of trust. Turkey believes the Kurdish militants are aligned with the Kurdish PYD party, which the Turks believe is allied with Kurds within Turkey who<U+2019>ve been waging a religious insurgency for over three decades. \nSo regardless of whether the U.S. finds the Kurds useful, Turkey has made it clear it intends to sleep with one eye open for the foreseeable future. In fact, it<U+2019>s taking a much more proactive stance than that. \nLast Thursday, in a campaign of airstrikes that were <U+201C>the heaviest against the YPG since Turkey launched a military incursion into Syria,<U+201D> Turkey targeted three Kurdish-controlled villages along the northern Syrian border. The Turkish military later confirmed it had carried out <U+201C>26 strikes on areas recently taken by the Kurdish YPG militia<U+201D> and <U+201C>had killed between 160 and 200 combatants.<U+201D> \nTurkey<U+2019>s major concern is that Kurdish-controlled enclaves will physically unite, <U+201C>thereby creating a de facto Kurdish mini-state along the Turkish border.<U+201D> As such, Turkey has warned Kurds to keep out of towns like Manjib, which is just northeast of the heaviest fighting in Aleppo. \nThis tangled web of strained alliances and old feuds will likely only grow more confusing as the U.S.-led operation to purge ISIS from Raqqa draws nearer. In any case, Turkish President Erdogan seems to have discovered a newfound independence , and the days of him obediently <U+2014> even if somewhat grudgingly <U+2014> bending to the U.S. will appear to be fading, as well. \n<U+201C>From now on we will now wait for problems to come knocking on our door, we will not wait until the blade is against our bone and skin, we will not wait for terrorist organizations to come and attack us,<U+201D> Erdogan said from his palace last week. <U+201C>Let them go wherever until we find and destroy them. I am saying this very clearly: they will not have a single place to find peace abroad.<U+201D> NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

This failure isn<U+2019>t an isolated event. Candid feedback from the U.K., NATO, Russia, Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Israel, Mexico, Syria and other nations would confirm the feelings of confusion, disappointment and even betrayal resulting from the Obama administration<U+2019>s blunders led by Secretaries Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. I was in the Philippines Oct. 7-21 as part of a trade mission. We were privileged to attend a very honest and intimate 90-minute speech conducted by President Duterte without notes, a script or a teleprompter. Very candid. Very revealing. I also listened carefully to cooks, waiters, farmers, retail clerks and taxi drivers, as well as CEOs, doctors, nurses, mayors, governors, cabinet secretaries and senators. To a person, they all support President Duterte. Why do they like him? He is ending the corruption whereby government and the wealthy have lived beyond accountability to the rule of law, enriched themselves and prevented common people from rising in dignity from their poverty. He is requiring that the progress of the nation be measured not by GDP alone, but by a reduction in poverty. Why does he resent interference from President Obama? He recalls that Barack Obama, as community organizer, did nothing to deliver Chicago from its drugs, corruption, gun violence and gangs. As senator, he did nothing to bring reform to Illinois, and as president he has yet to record a single foreign policy or economic development victory. John Anderson Gig Harbor, Wash. While I don<U+2019>t agree with Philippine President Duterte<U+2019>s decision to cozy up to China, I certainly understand it. His pivot away from Washington was entirely predictable because Mr. Duterte would prefer to deal with the devil he knows than the devil no one knows. Our near-decade-long absence of transparent foreign policy is rapidly catching up with us. Few of our allies trust us any longer, and who can blame them? When I served as an officer aboard a Naval destroyer in the South China Sea during the Vietnam War, I learned that any indication of weakness invites trouble. Mr. Duterte sees our weakness, but when he looks to China, he sees something very different. Jim Proffitt Jacksonville, Ill.",

According to his self-description, Adams is also a hypnotist of many years, trained in observing people and subtle nuances in appearance and body language. \nBelow is Adams<U+2019> post of September 11, 2016, <U+201C> Checking My Predictions About Clinton<U+2019>s Health ,<U+201D> which was republished by Russia Insider : \nIn a blog post I wrote on December 27th , 2015, I said this<U+2026> \nBonus Thought 1: One of the skills a hypnotist has to master is reading people<U+2019>s inner thoughts based on their body language. That<U+2019>s a common skill for people in the business world too, but hypnotists go deeper than looking at crossed arms and furrowed brows. We learn to look for subtle changes in breathing patterns, tiny changes in muscle tone, variations in skin color (blushing or not), word choice, pupil dilation, and more. I assume law enforcement people look for similar tells when doing interrogations. \nAs regular readers know, I<U+2019>m a trained hypnotist. And to me, Hillary Clinton looks as if she is hiding a major health issue. If you read Malcolm Gladwell<U+2019>s book, Blink , you know that so-called <U+201C>experts<U+201D> can sometimes instantly make decisions before they know why . In my case, I am going to make an <U+201C>expert<U+201D> hypnotist prediction about Hillary Clinton without knowing exactly which clues I am picking up, or whether I am hallucinating them. \nPrediction: I<U+2019>ll put the odds at 75% that we learn of an important Clinton health issue before the general election. That estimate is based on my own track record of guessing things about people without the benefit of knowing why . I think Trump is picking up the same vibe. He has already questioned Clinton<U+2019>s <U+201C>stamina.<U+201D> \nOn December 29th, 2015 I blogged that Trump would be seen as <U+201C>running unopposed<U+201D> before election day. I mentioned Clinton<U+2019>s health as a possible reason. \nWhile I<U+2019>m on the topic, I<U+2019>ll add another prediction to the Master Persuader series. I predict that by the time Trump is in the general election and running against Clinton, you will start hearing that Trump ( Lucky Hitler) is <U+2013> for all practical purposes <U+2013> <U+201C>running unopposed<U+201D> as Clinton<U+2019>s poll numbers plummet. \nThat can happen in a variety of ways. One way is if Clinton<U+2019>s health or legal issues rise to the point of being disqualifying, and Trump persuades us to think about those things more than we think about anything else. Once you imagine there is one candidate in the race who is eligible and one who might not survive the term, or might be in jail, you start to imagine it as a one-person race. \nAnd you will. That<U+2019>s how you get a landslide. \nLook for the words <U+201C>running unopposed<U+201D> in pundit articles and quotes within a few months of election day. And it still counts if it started here, because it won<U+2019>t catch on unless it actually fits. \nOn April 29th of 2016 I expanded on the thought in this post . \nI have blogged and tweeted that Hillary Clinton looks unhealthy to me. And I have mentioned on Twitter that one of the skills of a hypnotist is identifying subtle bodily changes. Observation is a huge part of a hypnotist<U+2019>s skill. You look for micro changes in muscle tone, breathing, posture, and anything else that can tell you whether your technique is working or you need to quickly pivot to a new approach. Think of it as rapid A-B testing on humans. And like any skill, one gets better with practice. I have more than three decades of practice for this specific skill. \nWhat I see in Clinton<U+2019>s health is an unusual level of variability. Sometimes her eyes bug out, sometimes they are tired and baggy. Sometimes she looks puffy, sometimes not. It would be easy to assume fatigue is the important variable. And that is clearly a big factor. But notice that the other candidates have little variability in their physicality. Trump always looks like Trump. Cruz always looks like Cruz, and so on. Sometimes we think we can detect fatigue in their answers, but visually the other candidates appear about the same every day. \nClinton, on the other hand, looks   That suggests some greater variability in her health. And that<U+2019>s probably a tell for medications that are waxing and waning but rarely at the ideal levels. Or perhaps the underlying conditions have normal variability. Or both. \nUnder normal circumstances it would be deeply irresponsible for a cartoonist to give a medical diagnosis to a stranger he hasn<U+2019>t met. I trust you to ignore my medical opinions. I do this to build a record of my persuasion-related predictions and to show you the method. \nI give Clinton a 50% chance of making it to November with sufficiently good health to be considered a viable president. Judging from her performance on the campaign trail, she is managing her health effectively to get the job done. But I would think most people who run for president end up sacrificing their health in some measure. The big question is how much buffer she has left. \nTo be clear, there is no dependable evidence of Clinton having an undisclosed major health issue. But it looks that way to observers. \n~End of Scott Adams<U+2019> article~ \nH/t FOTM<U+2019>s josephbc69",

Paul Joseph Watson - October 27, 2016 Comments Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s campaign circulated the name of one of Paul Ryan<U+2019>s relatives as a potential Supreme Court pick, suggesting a conflict of interest that could feed in to the Republican Speaker of the House<U+2019>s dislike for Donald Trump. An email released in part 19 of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features an article sent by Hillary advisor Sara Solow to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and Hillary<U+2019>s foreign policy advisor Jake Sullivan on February 29, 2016. The piece draws attention to Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. <U+201C>She was confirmed by without any Republican opposition in the Senate not once, but *twice*. She was confirmed to her current position in 2013 by unanimous consent <U+2013> that is, without any stated opposition. She was also previously confirmed unanimously to a seat on the U.S. Sentencing Commission (where she became vice chair),<U+201D> reads the email. <U+201C>Her family is impressive. She is married to a surgeon and has two young daughters. Her father is a retired lawyer and her mother a retired school principal. Her brother was a police officer (in the unit that was the basis for the television show *The Wire*) and is now a law student, and she is related by marriage to Congressman (and Speaker of the House) Paul Ryan.<U+201D> Earlier this month, Ryan said that he would no longer defend or campaign for Donald Trump. A poll released this week found that nearly two thirds of Republicans trust Donald Trump more than Ryan to lead the GOP. Many Trump supporters speculated that Ryan was involved in the leaking of the infamous Billy Bush tape, in which Trump made lewd comments about women, as part of a plot to sabotage the Republican nominee<U+2019>s campaign. Could the fact that one of his relatives is being touted as a likely Clinton Supreme Court pick be another reason as to why Ryan <U+2013> who has been accused by many of being in bed with the Washington establishment <U+2013> has abandoned his support for Donald Trump? \nSUBSCRIBE on YouTube:",

If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country.\nAt this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned <U+201C>about the possibility of violence<U+201D> on election day<U+2026>\nA 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are <U+201C>very concerned.<U+201D> Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are <U+201C>very confident<U+201D> about that.\nMore than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won<U+2019>t recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn<U+2019>t have won fair and square.\nBut many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump<U+2019>s star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax<U+2026>\nDonald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump<U+2019>s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first.\nAnd there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump<U+2019>s star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June <U+2026>\nThis is of course not the first time the GOP candidate<U+2019>s star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump<U+2019>s star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump<U+2019>s star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day.\nWe have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted <U+201C>Nazi Republicans get out of town or else<U+201D> along with a swastika.\nThere have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece<U+2026>\nOn Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, <U+201C>Why can<U+2019>t they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?<U+201D>\nAround Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. <U+201C>The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by <U+2018>some thugs<U+2019> that a barmaid called out from the back.<U+201D> Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a <U+201C>Blue Lives Matter<U+201D> shirt.\nOn Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a <U+201C>Make America Great Again<U+201D> baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope.\nThere is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let<U+2019>s certainly hope that we don<U+2019>t see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating.\nOf course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge.\nFor example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is <U+201C>grabbing my musket<U+201D> if Donald Trump loses the election<U+2026>\nFormer Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president.\nWalsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, <U+201C>On November 8th, I<U+2019>m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I<U+2019>m grabbing my musket. You in?<U+201D>\nAnd without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today <U+2026>\n<U+201C>Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I<U+2019>ve been buying a lot more ammunition,<U+201D> says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan<U+2019>s Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to <U+201C>declare martial law and take our guns away<U+201D> after the election.\nToday America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another.\nIronically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 .\nIf Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then.\nAnd the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month <U+2026>\n\nAs I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be.\nBut at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome .\nOut of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House.\nPerhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it.

It is a heavily Jewish area, and Ms. Wasserman Schultz was dressed the part. The pin she wore on her jacket said <U+201C>Ani Ita,<U+201D> Hebrew for <U+201C>I<U+2019>m with her.<U+201D> I have no idea how many of the Jews sitting in the coffee shop where we talked were actually able to understand the words, but I<U+2019>m sure most of them could identify Hebrew letters, and hence associate the congresswoman with their Jewish culture. Persuading Jewish voters in Florida to vote for Hillary Clinton was not nearly as hard as it was to persuade them to vote for Barack Obama eight and four years ago. Ms. Wasserman Schultz told me that Jewish voters trusted and loved Mrs. Clinton, and had few doubts about her. The congresswoman seemed to be right: Exit polls indicated that 71 percent of Jewish voters cast their ballot for the losing Democrat. In Florida, according to a poll commissioned by the organization J Street, 68 percent of Jews voted for Mrs. Clinton. So it seems that most Jewish Americans are in the losing camp. Seventy-two percent of Jews have an unfavorable view of the winning candidate, Donald J. Trump, according to another J Street poll. Some Jewish organizations clashed with Mr. Trump <U+2014> denouncing his words against Muslim immigrants and arguing that his campaign encouraged anti-Semitic language. When the American Israel Public Affairs Committee asked Mr. Trump to speak at its policy conference, some critics called the invitation <U+201C>shameful.<U+201D> In word and deed, Jewish Americans <U+2014> even many Republican-leaning Jews <U+2014> steered clear of Mr. Trump. Now Mr. Trump has been elected president. And Israel, while surprised by his rise, is quickly getting used to this new reality. Israeli Jews, like their American counterparts, would have preferred a Clinton victory and were somewhat suspicious of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s erratic ways. Then again, the president-elect says that he supports Israel, he seems to have amicable relations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and he has surrounded himself with people like Rudolph Giuliani and Newt Gingrich, who are well known for their friendship with Israel. What<U+2019>s not to like? If all goes well, Israelis are going to love the Trump administration. Mr. Trump seems uninterested in pressuring Israel to give away land and he has promised to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a longtime request by Israel, which views Jerusalem as its capital. His view of the international agreement on Iran<U+2019>s nuclear program is as bleak as Israel<U+2019>s, and he vowed to make it a priority to <U+201C>dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.<U+201D> If his policies match his campaign rhetoric, Israelis, with time, will grow to like him. American Jews, meanwhile, will seethe. Israel is dear to the hearts of most American Jews, but it is not a main political consideration when they vote in America. Fewer than 10 percent of them cite Israel as one of the most important issues in deciding for whom they vote. The Trump administration will not represent the first time that Israeli and American Jews have been at odds over American politics. In fact, in the last 16 years this has been the norm. American Jews did not support the George W. Bush administration <U+2014> Israelis did. American Jews were highly supportive of the Obama administration <U+2014> Israelis were highly critical of it. American presidents like Mr. Bush, Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump are bad for relations between Israel and Jews in the United States. They lay bare the fact that American Jews and Israeli Jews have different sets of priorities and values. These presidents underline the understandable, if unfortunate, reality that Jewish Americans prioritize Israel quite low as they vote <U+2014> and that Jewish Israelis do not care about the political sensitivities of American Jews. At times, this becomes contentious. Such was the case when some Jewish American groups debated whether their opposition to President Richard M. Nixon ought to be tamed because of his support for Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Such is the case when Israel knows that Jewish Americans are wary of certain leaders of the evangelical religious right, and yet accept their political support without many reservations. What will happen if American Jews see the good relationship that President Trump has with Israel? It will make many of them uneasy. It will make them doubt Israel<U+2019>s values and morality. It will alienate them from Israel. What is going to happen if Israeli Jews see American Jews oppose President Trump at every step? It will make the Israelis question the Americans<U+2019> good judgment, and doubt their commitment to Israel<U+2019>s security.

By Isaac Arnsdorf 11/16/16 01:05 PM EST Updated 11/17/16 10:59 AM EST Donald Trump<U+2019>s transition team appears to have deviated from its own ethics rule barring lobbyists whose work for Trump would overlap with any matters on which they lobbied in the previous year. According to a copy of Trump for America Inc.<U+2019>s Code of Ethical Conduct obtained by POLITICO, a member of the transition team must pledge to <U+201C>disqualify myself from involvement in any particular transition matter if I have engaged in regulated lobbying activities with respect to such matter, as defined by the Lobbying Disclosure Act, within the previous 12 months.<U+201D> Story Continued Below But at least eight transition team members have done work that appears to flout that internal rule, Senate records show. Steve Hart, chairman of Williams & Jensen who was tasked with the handoff of the Labor Department, lobbied on labor issues for Anthem, Brinks and Smithfield Foods as recently as September. Michael McKenna, who has been running the Energy Department transition, is a lobbyist at MWR Strategies for French utility Engie (formerly GDF Suez) and power provider Southern Company. Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck's David Bernhardt, charged with the Department of Interior, is registered to lobby for Westlands Water District. Bernhardt told POLITICO his colleagues contacted Interior and Justice Department officials, but he has lobbied only Congress for that client. Jim Carter, the in-house lobbyist for manufacturing company Emerson, has been in charge of tax reform, even though he lobbied on taxation issues as recently as September. Michael Catanzaro, a lobbyist at CGCN for the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, Hess, Encana, Noble Energy and Devon Energy, was made responsible for energy independence. Working with him was Mike Ference, a lobbyist at S-3 Group for Halliburton, Koch Industries and Marathon Oil. Martin Whitmer was charged with transportation and infrastructure even though he is a registered lobbyist at Whitmer & Worrall for the American Association of Railroads, the National Asphalt Pavement Association and the Utilities Technology Council. Presidential Transition By Eli Stokols Michael Torrey was put in charge of the Department of Agriculture even though he lobbied the USDA as recently as September on behalf of Little Caesars, Dean Foods, the American Beverage Association, and the Crop Insurance and Reinsurance Bureau. These lobbyists and the Trump transition did not answer requests for comment. The code of ethics was likely put in place under the leadership of Chris Christie, who was pushed aside last week and replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is now leading the transition effort. One source inside the transition team estimates that about 150 team members stood in line and signed this particular version of the code of ethics, as well as a nondisclosure form at a team meeting on Nov. 11, just hours before Trump shook up the team<U+2019>s leadership and put Pence in charge. The document says it was last updated Nov. 10, and it<U+2019>s not clear whether it<U+2019>s been updated since then. Some of the aides may have joined the transition before this policy was in effect. If Pence does end up revising the code of ethics, he would have to ask the roughly 200 transition team members to sign the new pledge. The White House is also waiting on a copy of the transition team<U+2019>s code of ethics before it can legally give the team briefings and allow it go into federal agencies 2016 By Gabriel Debenedetti Trump<U+2019>s transition has come under increased scrutiny for the number of lobbyists who have become attached to it, despite his repeated claim during his campaign that he wanted to rid Washington of lobbyists<U+2019> undue influence and <U+201C>drain the swamp.<U+201D> Pressed during a <U+201C>60 Minutes<U+201D> interview that aired on Sunday about his reliance on lobbyists, Trump said, <U+201C>That<U+2019>s the only people you have down there.<U+201D> He added that he still plans to <U+201C>clean up Washington<U+201D> but that he has no other option for the time being. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m saying that they know the system right now, but we<U+2019>re going to phase that out,<U+201D> Trump said. However, it appears that Pence is trying to make changes now. A senior Pence aide said the vice president-elect has issued a new decree for the transition team: a purge of all lobbyists from the operation. By Nolan D. McCaskill It<U+2019>s not clear, though, how quickly such a purge could occur, given how many lobbyists have been in critical positions in the already chaotic transition effort. It's also not clear whether lobbyists are no longer allowed to serve at all or can continue working on policy but not agency teams. It's also unknown whether any of the lobbyists listed above have been recently removed. According to the document, which spans two pages and requires a signature, individuals who don't comply with the policy may be fired. The code of ethics uses the definition of lobbying as defined by the Lobbying Disclosure Act. The people above were all registered under that law within the past year, according to Senate lobbying records reviewed by POLITICO. The policy uses a broader scope for restricting people's activities after the transition: For six months they may not \"communicate with or appear before, for compensation, any federal department or agency seeking official action\" on any matter for which they had \"direct and substantial responsibility\" during the transition, according to the document. The policy also forbids accepting gifts, advising foreign governments or political parties, and using information learned from the transition for private gain. Kenneth P. Vogel and Nancy Cook contributed to this report. By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

It is now normal for a large portion of pigs to have a complete GM diet. Human beings have become desensitized to inhumane animal practices. Not only do we consume the flesh of a living, breathing, feeling, intelligent sentient and loving being, we do it in mass amounts, and do it after they have been fed with feed that contributes in making human beings sick as well. It<U+2019>s no coincidence that the same financial institutions that hold majority stock in both the food/ biotech industry also hold major stock in the pharmaceutical/health industry. GMO testing on animals is inhumane, and is really not needed with all of the evidence already available to show how GMOs are very hazardous to human health. advertisement - learn more A study by scientist Judy Carman, PHD that was recently published in the peer reviewed journal Organic Systems outlines the effects of a diet mixed with GMO feed for pigs, and how it is a cause for concern when it comes to health (1). Scientists randomized and fed isowean pigs either a mixed GM soy and GM corn (maize) diet for approximately 23 weeks (nothing out of the ordinary for most pigs in the United States), which is unfortunately the normal lifespan of a commercial pig from weaning to slaughter. Equal numbers of male and female pigs were present in each group. The GM diet was associated with gastric and uterine differences in pigs. GM pigs had uteri that were 25% heavier than non-GM fed pigs. GM-fed pigs had a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation with a rate of 32% compared to 125 of non-GM fed pigs. The study concluded that pigs fed a GMO diet exhibited a heavier uteri and a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation than pigs who weren<U+2019>t fed a GMO diet. Because the use of GMO feed for livestock and humans is so widespread, this is defiantly another cause for concern when it comes to GMO consumption. Humans have a similar gastrointestinal tract to pigs, and these GM crops are consumed widely by people, especially in the United States. Although GM fed pigs seem to be the norm across North America, it<U+2019>s unnecessary to use animals for testing. Although animal testing does provide information, it is simply not needed, and extremely inhumane. Again, we do not need any more studies to show that GMOs are harmful to the health of all. It<U+2019>s not natural, world hunger and food shortage is a scam. We could easily feed the entire planet, and have multiple ways to do it. There should be no debate on the subject. There is a worldwide genocide happening right under our nose, if we don<U+2019>t speak up for these animals, who will? How can we consume these beings? It seems we have drifted so far away from our souls voice. How can we feed them GMO feed, and then feed that to ourselves? Any being foreign to this world would have a hard time looking upon it without feeling sick and hurt. We kill billions of animals for consumption every year. You can read more about the worldwide genocide on animals here . GMOs are gaining a lot of attention worldwide. The chinese government recently destroyed multiple shipments of GM corn, you can read more about that here . Japan and South Korea rejected U.S. wheat found to be polluted with GMOs, you can read about that here and here . Recently, a hidden viral gene that<U+2019>s harmful to human health was discovered in GMO crops, you can read more about that here . Scientists also discovered that Bt toxins found in Monsanto crops damage red blood cells, which you can read about here . Feel free to browse through our site for more information on GMOs. All of these studies show that when it comes to GMOs the body is not meant to take them in. Much Love.",

The Ohio Democratic Party's emergency application to the high court asked the justices to reimpose the restraining order a federal appeals court lifted earlier in the day, arguing the 6 th Circuit had issued a finding <U+201C>with no basis in law.<U+201D> Story Continued Below The application seems likely to face an uphill battle at the shorthanded Supreme Court. Five justices are typically needed to grant such relief and the court is currently split 4-4 between Democratic and Republican appointees. Partisan considerations aside, the justices are also often wary of making last-minute changes to election rules or procedures. U.S. District Court Judge James Gwin imposed the injunction Friday at the request of Ohio Democrats, who sued their Republican counterparts, the Trump campaign, Trump ally Roger Stone and his group Stop the Steal over their plans to seek out voter fraud at the polls and to conduct what Stone describes as \"citizens'\" exit polls. Gwin's broad order prohibited a variety of activities at or near polling places, such as following or photographing voters or their vehicles or informing them of the penalties for voter fraud. The judge's order was specifically aimed at the Trump campaign, Stone and Stop the Steal, while Gwin <U+2014> a Democratic appointee based in Cleveland <U+2014> said he was denying the request for a restraining order against the Ohio Republican Party. However, the order he issued barred similar actions at or near polling places by \"groups affiliated with the Clinton for Presidency campaign.\" After Trump's campaign appealed, a three-judge panel of the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a brief order Sunday morning lifting the injunction. The appeals court judges did not offer a detailed explanation of why they granted the stay, but said the Ohio Democrats failed to meet their burden to get the injunction they received. \"We conclude that the Plaintiff did not demonstrate before the district court a likelihood of success on the merits, and that all of the requisite factors weigh in favor of granting the stay,\" the 6th Circuit panel wrote. All three appeals court judges who ruled on the stay request, Alice Batchelder, John Rogers and Richard Griffin, are Republican appointees. In their 36-page petition, the Democrats argued the 6 th Circuit issued its finding without requesting any substantive briefings on the case, an <U+201C>extraordinary departure from the most basic requirements of appellate procedure<U+201D> that led to a <U+201C>cursory order with no basis in law.<U+201D> How could the court of appeals, the Democrats asked, <U+201C>conclude that a lower court has abused its discretion without first reviewing and considering the actual evidence on which the lower court<U+2019>s decision was based.<U+201D> The Democrats' suit pointed to statements by Trump urging supporters to show up at polling places in \"certain areas\" and take steps to make sure individuals do not cast multiple votes. By Josh Gerstein However, Trump's camp said they had no plans to break the law and they raised doubts about the constitutionality of Gwin's injunction, which could have been read to prohibit some activities by the media. It was also unclear whether the order was limited to Ohio or had broader geographic sweep. \"The order tramples upon core First Amendment freedoms. It imposes vague prohibitions against poorly defined categories of core political activity <U+2014> talking to voters, giving information to voters, etc. <U+2014> that guarantee hundreds (if not thousands) of Ohioans will be chilled from participating in our democratic process,\" Trump campaign attorney Chad Readler wrote. \"The order prohibits anyone from having a truthful discussion about voting rules with another voter when the two are heading inside to vote....The untailored list of examples of such activity in the order offers more confusion than clarity.\" The Ohio suit is one of at least six similar lawsuits Democrats have filed in the past week, urging judges to combat alleged voter intimidation by Trump and Stone. The application filed with the Supreme Court Sunday night was directed to Justice Elena Kagan, who oversees the 6th Circuit. However, in high-profile cases, the circuit justice almost always refers such applications to all of her colleagues to allow them to weigh in for or against the requested relief.

Who needs polls? They never gave him a chance but now we have it: President Donald Trump. Not only were the polls spectacularly wrong (who will ever trust this particularly bankrupt form of moralising presumptive analysis and telling us how we do and should feel?) but also the pundits who were not just arrogant about the fact that Trump had no chance but also were hopelessly out of touch with what America was thinking across its societal spectrum, what it wanted, what was felt deep in its blood.\nIt is a rejection of the liberal consensus the entire West has wallowed in since the 90's and a rejection of Obama and the false hope he decried, the impotent nature of US political leverage around the world and the rejection of brazen corruption and questionable ethics as typified by \"Crooked Hillary\".\nThe world must live with it; democracy has spoken and they're going to have to get over the words President Trump. Some will head for the hills, some will run to Canada, others will continue to cry but as Obama said yesterday, regardless of the result \"tomorrow the sun will still shine.\"\nThis is a cry for American exceptionalism and like him or not Trump typifies that. He is committed to education, and demands high performance. Selling well is an admirable skill for a President to have. Negotiating with Congress, internationally, etc., is exceptionally useful. Trump has taken beatings financially and come out smelling like a rose.\nTrump's business experience involves negotiations with business leaders and even governments around the world, and he likely has connections behind the scenes that surpass those of simply purely political candidates -- this gives him keen, realistic insights into economics in different parts of the world, as well as additional avenues to pursue trade agreements, and even perhaps some nuanced insights of particular financial weaknesses of possible global competitors, not to mention experience and insight into the partnerships and/or antagonism between different industries and particular governments.\nMORE...

What Donald Trump is doing is representing the absolute heartbreak and anger and frustration at a government gone mad and it seems the Left completely underestimated that in their vitriol in crying #NeverTrump and portraying him as the devil incarnate.\nAlthough it is entirely true that Trump is ostentatious and has his mistakes, he brings something to the Presidential table no other candidate had before; he speaks his mind.\nAmerica clearly is sick of weasel politicians who are too afraid to say what people want to hear, they want the facts straight.\nPresident Trump isn't cut from the political class, that class which is entrenched in its self-interest and has let the country down time and time again. Ross Perot once said that we need somebody to clean out the stables, a corrupted, ethically questionable President is therefore not the answer in order to accomplish that and I'm not talking about Donald Trump.\nTrump is a pragmatist in an era of rapidly approaching chaos, he is not a social engineer, a think tanker who wants to please those lining his bank accounts. The liberal Democratic policies of Obama, U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Sen. Harry Reid and their company created a climate that has led to this decision today.\nSo what if his language is intemperate and insulting? Even lacking in nobility from time to time?

He had promise and he let so many down, what did Clinton have? And that is why conservative voters had to get out and vote.\nTrump prefers isolationism on a world scale, Clinton voted to take us to war in Iraq and to overthrow Libya's Gaddafi, all in the guise of being \"muscular.\"\nPerhaps today's landmark and historic decision is not so much about Trump's strengths and power but more about the crippled weakness of the country in 2016 and you simply cannot blame him for that.",

        "input": "time: null \n author: The European Union Times \n source: eutimes.net \n text: \nA grim new Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that intelligence analysts of the System of Forward-looking Military Research and Development ( SFLMRD ) have now placed the United States in the <U+201C> active zone <U+201D> of nations currently undergoing a <U+201C> Colour Revolution <U+201D> as both US and EU elites have united to topple the soon to come government of President-elect Donald Trump. [ Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\nAccording to this report, SFLMRD intelligence analysts are tasked with using <U+201C> modern/sophisticated <U+201D> technologies to ensure and protect the Federation<U+2019>s national security interests<U+2014>and of which the MoD has previously identified <U+201C> Colour Revolutions <U+201D> as being one of the gravest threats, not only to Russia, but the entire world.\nDuring the MoD<U+2019>s 2014 meeting of the Moscow Conference on International Security , this report explains, Federation military commanders labeled <U+201C> Colour Revolutions <U+201D> as a new US and European approach to warfare that focuses on creating destabilizing revolutions in other nations as a means of serving their security interests at low cost and with minimal casualties .\nThe some of first of these Western <U+201C> Colour Revolutions <U+201D> to be unleashed on an unsuspecting world, this report continues, was in 2003 when the legitimately elected democratic government of Georgia was overthrown in what was called the <U+201C> Rose Revolution <U+201D><U+2014>and that turned this once peaceful nation into a Western military puppet who, in 2008, launched an unprovoked attack against the Federation , but that was quickly and decisively defeated.\nNext to be attacked by a Western <U+201C> Colour Revolution <U+201D>, this report notes, was Ukraine, in 2004, who<U+2019>s <U+201C> Orange Revolution <U+201D> resulted in the 2014 overthrow of that nations legitimately elected government in what the powerful American private intelligence agency Stratfor (aka The Shadow CIA ) called <U+201C> the most blatant coup in history <U+201D><U+2014>and like Georgia before it, has, likewise, been used by the West as a military puppet against the Federation .\nIn 2005, this report continues, the West then launched a <U+201C> Colour Revolution <U+201D> against Kyrgyzstan called the <U+201C> Tulip Revolution <U+201D><U+2014>but that ultimately failed leading that nation, in 2014, to expel the US military from its territory .\nOnce the subversive tactics of the West in their using their <U+201C> Colour Revolutions <U+201D> against other nations was <U+201C> deciphered/discovered <U+201D>, this report says, both Iran (2009-<U+201C> Green Revolution <U+201D>) and Russia (2011-<U+201C> White (Snow) Revolution <U+201D>) were able to be stop them from being successful and causing great loss of life.\nTo exactly how the West <U+201C> engineered/manipulated <U+201D> their <U+201C> Colour Revolutions <U+201D>, this report explains, was through the use of what are called non-governmental organizations ( NGO<U+2019>s ) using very innocuous sounding names that the United States and European Union would secretly funnel millions-of-dollars into for the purpose of fermenting rebellion<U+2014>and which, in 2015, President Putin signed a law against preventing their nefarious actions in the Federation .\nHeading nearly all of these Western backed and financed <U+201C> Colour Revolution <U+201D> NGO<U+2019>s, this report details, is the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros <U+2014>who has not only fomented rebellions across the world costing thousands of innocent lives, he was, also, recently exposed as being Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s puppetmaster controlling all of her actions during her failed bid to become the US president .\nUnlike the Federation that has protected itself against a George Soros led, and US-EU funded, NGO <U+201C> Colour Revolution <U+201D>, this report grimly warns, the United States government has now become the most vulnerable nation in the world to this type of <U+201C> rebellion/warfare <U+201D> as he funds hundreds of organizations violently opposed to both America and that nations core moral values .\nAnd immediately upon Donald Trump being elected as the 45 th President of the United States, this report states, these George Soros funded NGO<U+2019>s launched their newest <U+201C> Colour Revolution <U+201D> intended not only to destroy President Trump, but the entirety of America.\nLed by the George Soros funded MoveOn.org NGO , this report continues, this new <U+201C> Colour Revolution <U+201D> striking American began with tens-of-thousands of protesters striking nearly all of the United States largest cities <U+2014>and that was quickly followed with thousands of these revolutionaries calling for the assassination of President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence before they can take office .\nTo the main <U+201C> purpose/reason <U+201D> behind these protests, this report explains, is to initiate a <U+201C> brutal/violent <U+201D> response from US government forces seeking to suppress them and reestablish order<U+2014>which in turn these revolutionaries will use as an example of how the American government is no longer legitimate because it<U+2019>s killing innocent people, and, therefore, must be overthrown.\nNot being understood by the American people about how these <U+201C> Colour Revolutions <U+201D> work, this report continues, is that they are intended to last for years<U+2014>like in Ukraine that took a full 10 years before that government was overthrown.\nTo the most basic reason why this <U+201C> Colour Revolution <U+201D> is now targeting the United States, this report details, are the US-EU elites fear of President-elect Donald Trump whose choice of nationalism over globalism has left European leftist leaders in <U+201C> complete horror <U+201D> as the populace revolution he, Trump, is leading is soon to wash ashore in Europe as new elections for nearly all of the continent are nearing<U+2014>with Holland being the first fall , and France soon to follow , and whose next leader, Marine Le Pen , just proclaimed: <U+201C> Congratulations to the new President of the US, Donald Trump, and the American people <U+2013> free! <U+201D>\nWith the US propaganda mainstream media still in denial of what has happened to them because of President-elect Donald Trump<U+2019>s victory, and Google now reporting that their top search term is <U+201C> How did Donald Trump win? <U+201D> , this report further states, it bears notice that the Kremlin and its intelligence analysts were among the only entities in the world who correctly stated Donald Trump would win<U+2014>and as we had detailed in numerous reports, including Russia Confirms Supercomputer Findings Showing Donald Trump Landslide Victory and Russian Report Warns: American Revolution Has Now Begun, May Last Entire Decade .\nBut to the most global consequential outcome of Donald Trump becoming the 45 th President of the United States, this report concludes, (and as we had previously alerted you to on 13 May in our report Putin Warns Military Commanders: <U+201C>If It<U+2019>s Hillary Clinton, It<U+2019>s War<U+201D> ) was President Putin<U+2019>s advisor Sergei Glaziev stating just hours ago how close to catastrophe our world actually was: <U+201C> Americans had two choices: World War III or multilateral peace. Clinton was a symbol of war, and Trump has a chance to change this course .<U+201D>\nLet<U+2019>s all hope President Trump can, indeed, change this course because the world, literally, now hangs in the balance if he doesn<U+2019>t.\nSource \n",

WikiLeaks has a long-standing policy of not commenting on sources , so even such a denial is highly unusual. \nAssange insisted however that it was necessary to deny the claims, saying that Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s camp <U+201C>has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria<U+201D> with false claims that Russia<U+2019>s government in behind the hacked emails as part of a plot to rig next week<U+2019>s election. \nRussia has long denied being involved in the hacking, but the Clinton campaign has run heavily on the issue, accusing Republican candidate Donald Trump of being a <U+201C>puppet<U+201D> of the Russian government, who they are trying to install by leaking embarrassing emails. \nThe campaign<U+2019>s allegations have so far been pretty effective at limiting media coverage of the content of the leaks, with a lot more attention going to the speculation that Russia is plotting to <U+201C>hack the vote<U+201D> for Trump. Whether Assange<U+2019>s straightforward denial is sufficient to bring the focus back to content remains to be seen, though the Democratic campaign is unlikely to give up what has been materially their main talking point over the past several months just because the facts don<U+2019>t support it.

After the initial shock of Trump<U+2019>s election last Tuesday, some GOP elites had consoled themselves over early talk that the New York real estate mogul might choose for the most sensitive posts in his government several well-known centrists with conventional views who might temper Trump<U+2019>s boldest impulses. Story Continued Below But that mood has darkened sharply since the weekend. In recent days, Trump aides have signaled that Giuliani <U+2014> who has no formal diplomatic experience and who critics say is tangled in conflicts of interest <U+2014> might be asked to run the State Department. Another contender for that post is former ambassador John Bolton, a contentious figure whom even a Republican Senate refused to confirm when George W. Bush tapped him to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 2005. (Bolton was installed at the U.N. by recess appointment.) Meanwhile, several well-regarded figures, such as former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, who was ousted from Trump<U+2019>s transition team on Tuesday, are no longer seen as being in play for senior jobs. As a seven-term congressman from Michigan, Rogers was widely respected, even among many Democrats <U+2014> a potential reason he was shown the exit from Trump<U+2019>s transition. The conservative Weekly Standard magazine noted on Tuesday that Rogers had overseen a 2014 House Intelligence Committee report on the September 2012 Benghazi attacks that angered conservatives with its conclusion that the Obama administration had not misled the public about that event. Other sources familiar with the transition said that Rogers had been purged for his connection to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was ousted last week as the head of Trump<U+2019>s transition team. Presidential Transition By Eli Stokols Other foreign policy figures whom Republicans say would be natural choices for any other GOP president-elect are conspicuously absent from Trump campaign personnel leaks. They include Stephen Hadley, a centrist who served as George W. Bush<U+2019>s national security adviser; outgoing New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a leading GOP voice on defense and national security; and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, considered a temperate mainstream voice. Rogers had been in line for a top intelligence post, possibly CIA director. <U+201C>Last week, people were buoyed that Hadley might be under consideration and Corker seemed to have a shot at secretary of state,<U+201D> said one disillusioned Republican with ties to the Trump transition. Now those fleeting hopes have been dashed, several sources said. The growing understanding that Hadley is highly unlikely to join the Trump team was particularly deflating, sources said. Many establishment Republicans had pinned their hopes on a key role for Hadley, perhaps as secretary of defense, because he was among the most senior GOP foreign policy insiders not to publicly denounce Trump during the campaign and because he inspires loyalty in GOP circles. Many Republicans critical of Trump said they found it hard to imagine Giuliani or Bolton as America<U+2019>s top diplomat. Giuliani lacks traditional foreign policy experience, although he does enjoy Trump<U+2019>s personal trust after serving as one of his staunchest campaign defenders, including after a tape of Trump making lewd comments threatened his candidacy. By Edward-Isaac Dovere After witnessing the 2001 destruction of the World Trade Center when he was mayor of New York, Giuliani has been impassioned on the subject of Islamic terrorism to a degree that makes even many hawkish Republicans uncomfortable. <U+201C>I said <U+2018>Islamic extremist terrorism!<U+2019><U+201D> Giuliani cried at the Republican National Convention this summer in a speech many noted for its bellowing delivery. <U+201C>You know who you are! And we<U+2019>re coming to get you!<U+201D> Corker, by contrast, has rarely been heard to raise his voice, a quality far more typical for a prominent diplomat. Several Republicans conceded that Bolton has a strong grasp of foreign policy and diplomacy, drawn from a long State Department career that included his tenure at the U.N. But many are turned off by his contentious manner. Republicans also noted that Giuliani has had numerous business dealings abroad, including in the Middle East, that will draw sharp scrutiny. Both Giuliani and Bolton have reportedly taken money from and supported the Mojahedin-e-Khalq, an Iranian political-military organization that advocates the violent overthrow of Iran<U+2019>s clerical regime but which was considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. until 2012. Former ambassador John Bolton was tapped by George W. Bush to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 2005.  | Getty Top Republicans also expressed strong doubts about the fitness of other inner-circle Trump advisers to hold top foreign policy positions, including retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who has been mentioned as a possible national security adviser. To Trump<U+2019>s allies, the complaints from the GOP establishment are a sign that he is on the right path. During his first major foreign policy speech in April, Trump vowed to <U+201C>look for talented experts with new approaches, and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect r<U+00E9>sum<U+00E9>s but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war.<U+201D> But many elder statesmen of the foreign policy world have grown alarmed that Trump<U+2019>s team will not be prepared for the dangers of the increasingly unstable world they will inherit. At a Monday meeting of the elite Aspen Strategy Group, Brent Scowcroft, who served as George H.W. Bush<U+2019>s national security adviser <U+2014> and who endorsed Hillary Clinton <U+2014> urged attendees, <U+201C>If you're asked to serve, please do. This man needs help.<U+201D> White House By Nahal Toosi For many Republican insiders, that does not seem to an option. Republicans who might be stepping into plum jobs under a president Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio say it is becoming clear that Trump and his opaque inner circle don<U+2019>t seem hungry for establishment expertise. <U+201C>They've got a quality gap they have to close. And if you pick someone like Kelly Ayotte, you<U+2019>re going to get people who think, <U+2018>You know what? [Trump] wasn't my guy, but he<U+2019>s president, he<U+2019>s making good personnel choices. I feel like I can go and work for her,'\" said a former senior Republican foreign policy official. <U+201C>None of that is happening,<U+201D> he added. <U+201C>No one <U+2014> literally not a single Republican I know, and I know a lot of Republicans <U+2014> is talking to that tiny inner circle<U+201D> in Trump Tower, said one former George W. Bush administration foreign policy official. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s because the Trump people don<U+2019>t want to talk.<U+201D> Evidence for that came Tuesday from Eliot A. Cohen, a former aide to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. An adamant opponent during the campaign, Cohen had urged fellow Republicans after the election to consider serving Trump in the national interest. But on Twitter on Tuesday, Cohen reversed course. <U+201C>After exchange w Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away,<U+201D> Cohen wrote . <U+201C>They're angry, arrogant, screaming 'you LOST!' Will be ugly.<U+201D> By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

Jackson is also close to John Podesta , Clinton<U+2019>s national campaign chairman. \nMorocco<U+2019>s state-owned phosphate company, OCP, would ostensibly have benefited from Jackson<U+2019>s move to shut down Mosaic. Mohammed donated up to $15 million to the Clinton Foundation through OCP. \nClinton also relaxed U.S. foreign aid restrictions on Morocco, thus allowing U.S. funds to be used in the territory of Western Sahara where OCP operates phosphate mining operations. The aid restrictions stemmed from Morocco<U+2019>s illegal occupation of the territory since 1974. \nMorocco is repeatedly condemned for seizing the territory and for unilaterally extracting the country<U+2019>s valuable minerals, impoverishing what<U+2019>s left of the local Sahrawi Arabs. \nNo nation recognizes Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara and the United Nation<U+2019>s Security Council legal office and the International Court of Justice both demand that Muhammed withdraw his claim over the territory and end illegal extraction of minerals. \nAn email WikiLeaks made public last week illustrated how Clinton, while acting as secretary of state, negotiated an additional $12 million donation to the Clinton Foundation from Muhammed in return for holding the 2015 Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) meeting in Marrakech, Morocco. Another $1 million payment came from OCP to cover the expenses of the CGI meeting. \nThe regulatory assault against the U.S. phosphate industry began in earnest when Jackson launched a barrage of intimidating regulatory initiatives against Mosaic. Environmental concerns about phosphates date from 1979 but the EPA did little to address concerns related to phosphate mining until Jackson<U+2019>s 2011 moves. \nThe regulatory assault on the U.S. phosphate industry encompassed several agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS aircraft flew at low altitudes over Mosaic<U+2019>s central Florida operations in search of environmental problems. The EPA also threatened large Superfund penalties, which could have bankrupted Mosaic. \nPhosphates are essential ingredients in fertilizers used in American farming. Closing or reducing Mosaic<U+2019>s output would have cost tens of thousands of American jobs and injured the country<U+2019>s agricultural productivity. \nIt also would leave the U.S. dependent upon foreign phosphate producers, but particularly Morocco<U+2019>s OCP. The only other countries that mine phosphates are Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. \nRep. Dennis Ross, a Republican congressman who represents the Florida district where Mosaic operates, told TheDCNF he now sees why the EPA went after Mosaic. \n<U+201C>The tactics makes perfect sense as to why the EPA, under Lisa Jackson<U+2019>s tutelage, targeted Mosaic<U+2019>s phosphate operations in my district. I was never given any answers when I questioned Lisa Jackson about the EPA<U+2019>s deliberate actions against Mosaic,<U+201D> Ross told TheDCNF. \n<U+201C>Now I know why. An environmental concern never existed. This targeting was all done as a payback to Morocco for donating millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation,<U+201D> Ross said. \nAn uproar from Florida regulators push-back from the state<U+2019>s congressional delegation and the agency<U+2019>s tenuous legal position all forced the EPA to end its threats against Mosaic. \nRep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who is vice-chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and a vocal critic of the Clinton Foundation, agreed with Ross, saying <U+201C>these facts seem to reveal the possibility of more pay-to-play activities at the Clinton Foundation.<U+201D> \n<U+201C>It would be especially troubling if the Clinton Foundation was working with the EPA to suppress the American phosphate industry in favor of Morocco. The EPA and Clinton Foundation should be forthcoming about their dealings with the Moroccan government and the American phosphate industry.<U+201D> \nClinton<U+2019>s 2012 support of a rider on the U.S. foreign aid bill permitting foreign aid to be sent to the Western Sahara arguably legitimized Moroccan occupation of territory and depopulated the Sahrawi Arabs. Native Moroccans were sent into the country by the government to extract the minerals. \nThe rider approved by Clinton said that U.S. foreign aid funds <U+201C>may be used in regions and territories administered by Morocco,<U+201D> meaning, the Western Sahara. The Western Sahara is classified a <U+201C>Non-Self-Governing Territory<U+201D> under international law. \n<U+201C>Previously, United States excluded Western Sahara from bilateral assistance to avoid seeming to endorse Moroccan control,<U+201D> said Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at Northwestern University School of Law, in a legal review of occupied territories around the world. \nHans Corell, the U.N. Security Council<U+2019>s Under-Secretary for Legal Affairs, said in January 2002 that <U+201C>if further exploration and exploitation activities were to proceed in disregard of the interests and wishes of the people of Western Sahara, they would be in violation of the international law principles applicable to mineral resource activities in Non-Self-Governing Territories.<U+201D> \nA Dec. 10, 2015 report by the International Court of Justice ruled that <U+201C>the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco over Western Sahara is not recognized by the European Union or its Member States, or more generally by the UN, and the absence of any international mandate capable of justifying Moroccan presence on that territory.<U+201D> \nBut none of that mattered to former President Bill Clinton, who said nothing about the world<U+2019>s condemnation of Morocco<U+2019>s exploitation of the area for its phosphate industry, while speaking at the Clinton Foundation<U+2019>s 2015 Marrakech CGI conference. Instead, he praised it. \n<U+201C>The Moroccans who are here will tell you that in the last several years, they have become the Saudi Arabia of phosphates, and what they have done with it, to diversify their economy and to make it part of a comprehensive strategy instead of another example of resource curse, is very impressive indeed,<U+201D> Clinton said. \n<U+201C>Hillary Clinton sold her soul when they accepted that money,<U+201D> reported Politico the day after the Marrakech CGI conference. \nH/T <U+2013> DailyCaller \nSupport the Trump Movement and help us fight Liberal Media Bias.

The travesty was engineered by the Superpower of Lies to punish Moscow for resisting the U.S.-led war of sectarian massacre and regime change in Syria. The War Party is on the march, to the cheers of corporate media <U+0096> and Hillary hasn<U+0092>t even been elected yet.\nBy Margaret Kimberley <U+0093>All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people.<U+0094>\nNovember 06, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" BAR \" - Did Russia invade Iraq and kill one million people? Does Russia have a greater percentage of its population behind bars than any other country in the world? Did Russia occupy Haiti after kidnapping its president? Are Russian police allowed to shoot children to death without fear of repercussion? Is Russia entering its 20th year of a terror war against the people of Somalia? All of these crimes take place in or at the direction of the United States. Yet the full force of propaganda and influence on world opinion is directed against Russia, which whatever its shortcomings cannot hold a candle to America in violating human rights.\nThe dangers presented by a Hillary Clinton presidency cannot be overstated. She and the war party have been steadily working towards a goal that defies logic and risks all life on earth. Regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against Russia.\nNearly every claim of Russian evil doing is a lie, a ruse meant to put Americans in a fighting mood and lose their fear of nuclear conflagration. It isn<U+0092>t clear if Clinton and the rest of the would-be warriors actually realize they are risking mushroom clouds. Perhaps they believe that Vladimir Putin will be easily pushed around when all evidence points to the contrary.\nThe unproven allegations of interference in the presidential election and casting blame on Russia as the sole cause of suffering in Syria are meant to desensitize the public. It is an age old ploy which makes war not just acceptable but deemed a necessity. The usual suspects are helping out eagerly. The corporate media, led by newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post , are front and center in pushing tales of Russian villainy. Human Rights Watch and other organizations who care nothing about abuses committed by the United States and its allies are also playing their usual role of choosing the next regime change victim.\nRussia lost its seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council in part because of American pressure and public relations assistance from the human rights industrial complex. The UNHRC is now chaired by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy that funds the jihadist terrorist groups who caused 500,000 Syrian deaths. The Saudis are causing dislocation, death and starvation in Yemen, too, but they are American allies, so there is little opposition to their misdeeds.\nThe openly bigoted Donald Trump has been the perfect foil for Hillary Clinton. That is why she and the rest of the Democratic Party leadership preferred him as their rival. He made the case for the discredited lesser evilism argument and his sensible statements about avoiding enmity with Russia made him even more useful.\nThe United States and its allies are the cause of Syria<U+0092>s destruction. Their effort to overthrow president Assad created a humanitarian disaster complete with ISIS and al Nusra fighters who love to chop off heads for entertainment. Far from being the cause of the catastrophe Russia left its ally to fight alone for four years. They even made overtures to negotiate Assad<U+0092>s fate with the United States. All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people. The people of east Aleppo are being shelled by American allies but one wouldn<U+0092>t know that by reading what passes for journalism in newspapers and on television. The American role in the slaughter is barely mentioned or is excused as an effort to protect the civilian population. The bloodshed was made in the U.S. and could end if this government wanted it to.\nThe anti-Russian propaganda effort has worked to perfection. NATO is massing troops on Russia<U+0092>s borders in a clear provocation yet Putin is labeled the bad guy. He is said to be menacing the countries that join in threatening his nation. The United States makes phony claims of Russian war crimes despite having blood on its hands. The latest Human Rights Watch canards about prosecuting Assad come straight from the White House and State Department and have nothing to do with concern for Syrians living in their fifth year of hell.\nThere is no lesser evil between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. She is fully supported by the war party in her desire for a more <U+0093>muscular<U+0094> foreign policy. That bizarre term means death and starvation for millions more people if Clinton wins in a landslide. She must be denied a victory of that magnitude and any opportunity to claim a mandate. Peace loving people must give their votes to the Green Party ticket of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka. They are alone in rejecting the premise of an imperialist country and its endless wars.\nThe United States is the most dangerous country in the world. If it has a reckless and war loving president the threat becomes existential. That is the prospect we face with a Hillary Clinton presidency. If the role of villain is cast on the world stage she is the star of the show.\nMargaret Kimberley's Freedom Rider column appears weekly in BAR, and is widely reprinted elsewhere.

Mr. Williams said in Detroit on Thursday he is prepared to talk with Mr. Trump about trade and sees <U+201C>a great opportunity<U+201D> to <U+201C>find some common ground.<U+201D> Specifically, Mr. Trump has been a critic of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Mr. Williams also said he hopes Mr. Trump<U+2019>s goal of increasing infrastructure spending will lead to additional projects. The UAW has long opposed Nafta and said TPP is problematic, citing concerns about job loss for U.S. manufacturing workers. Membership in the UAW, which represents factory workers at Ford Motor Co. , General Motors Co. , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and auto suppliers, has slipped since Nafta was forged in 1992 as Detroit car makers moved production to Mexico and bought components from parts makers outside the U.S. <U+201C>We agree Nafta either needs to be renegotiated or ended,<U+201D> Mr. Williams said. The UAW president<U+2019>s comments underscore the broad appeal Mr. Trump had during his campaign, leading him to perform well in Rust Belt states initially expected to swing to Hillary Clinton. Mr. Williams estimates potentially more than a third of UAW members voted for Mr. Trump, and union officials detected anger within the rank-and-file in the days before the election. The UAW initially expected lower support among its 400,000 members for Mr. Trump. The organization will conduct studies to get more concrete results. Mr. Williams said support may have been higher than 32% given the amount of people indicating they were undecided just before the election. It is unclear if support from the UAW on trade will embolden Mr. Trump<U+2019>s trade stance, which includes slapping a 35% tariff on certain products shipped to the U.S. from Mexico. He singled out Ford, which is moving small-car production from Michigan to Mexico in coming years, for criticism. There were 926,000 jobs associated with motor vehicle and car parts production in October, according to preliminary figures provided the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a number that has been little changed since mid-2015. While auto manufacturing jobs are nearing the highest point since early 2008, hourly earnings of $21.32 an hour, on average, are slightly lower than a year-ago and nearly $1 lower than when industry employment was last this high. While lower-cost assembly plants have been opened during the past decade by foreign companies such as Volkswagen AG and China<U+2019>s Fuyao Glass Industry Group the UAW has agreed to concessions and contract terms that led to deep job losses and lower pay scales. In late 2015, Mr. Williams signed contracts with Detroit auto makers that secured wage increases and phased out controversial tiered-wage systems in U.S. car factories. For decades, anything that Ford, GM or Chrysler sold on dealer lots was considered an American car, while those built by all other auto makers were deemed foreign. Even as Toyota Motor Corp. , Nissan Motor Co. and others opened plants in Southern states and sourced more parts from U.S. parts factories, they continued to be considered outsiders. The definition of an American car also is rapidly changing as Detroit auto makers rely more on Mexican labor to assemble vehicles, and purchase an increasing share of auto parts from factories outside the U.S. In 2017 model year cars sold by Ford, GM and Chrysler, an average of 51% of parts came from U.S. or Canadian sources, down from 52.5% in the prior model year. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration compiles data on vehicle content every model year. The latest data are preliminary and will be updated as more models are introduced for the coming model year. Nearly two-thirds of the 64 models the Detroit auto makers have introduced for the 2017 model year will be built by UAW members. While less than 20% are assembled in Mexico, many so-called domestic cars have half of their parts content sourced from south of the U.S. border. Write to John D. Stoll at john.stoll@wsj.com",

It will create it with solar panels and a technology that capitalizes on moisture in the air.\nThe company<U+2019>s tag line is <U+2018>drinking water democratized,<U+2019> and it certainly seems to stand for the exact opposite world view of, say, Nestle , which has been stealing water from people and San Bernardino National Forest reserves and then selling it back to people in plastic water bottles. Zero Mass Water can deliver clean water to people in the poorest nations, with no need for piping or complicated water plants. The solar panel itself is smaller than a traditional air conditioner and can be placed in remote areas with ease.\nThe United Nations claims that more than 783 million people currently lack clean drinking water and more than 6 million people die annually from water-borne disease. They also claim that, with population growth, we can expect a 50 percent increase in water demand; but they haven<U+2019>t accounted for simple technologies which can make use of millions of gallons of water using clean, sustainable, and even simple technologies. The demand for water could also easily be met by practicing better water harvesting, catchment, and filtering.\nZero Mass Water joins other breakthrough technologies like the <U+201C>Drinkable Book<U+201D> and experimental wastewater filters , which are trying to bring water to every corner of the world.\nA blog post from Duke Energy, a partner in Zero Mass<U+2019>s project claims the water purification system doesn<U+2019>t need an outside source of energy, so it can be placed were infrastructure is damaged or non-existent.\nAt a recent installation in the coastal city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, a medical clinic was able to enjoy clean water for the first time without having to haul it in with trucks <U+2014> an expensive endeavor. Though it rains frequently in Ecuador, there is little potable water .\nThe project has targeted an even larger area for humanitarian aid <U+2014> water-generating solar panels are being placed in Jordan. The company claims the panels will help Syrian refugees in the country, possibly aiding 200,000 people, who currently have no access to clean drinking water.\nIf Zero Mass Water is successful in a war-torn area, their solar panels might also be perfect for the 5,300 cities across the U.S. who have been drinking lead-contaminated water due to crumbling infrastructure and a political elite who have been unwilling to replace old pipes with new ones, along with expensive water filters on municipal supplies.\nWhen the sun can bring you energy, and drinking water, there is little need for poverty, ill-health, and reliance upon aging government and corporate structures .

Story Continued Below Kaine<U+2019>s comments echo those made Friday by Clinton and her campaign chairman John Podesta, both of whom demanded the FBI explain its reasoning. \"We are 11 days out from perhaps the most important national election of our lifetimes. Voting is already underway in our country. So the American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately,\" Clinton told reporters during a brief news conference in Iowa. Podesta, whose hacked emails the FBI said are not the source of the evidence under review, called Comey's move \"extraordinary.\" By Josh Gerstein and Madeline Conway Earlier Friday, Comey notified the chairs of several congressional committees that the bureau was reviewing a fresh group of messages from Clinton<U+2019>s time as secretary of state, thrusting the email issue back into the national spotlight within weeks of the Nov. 8 election. Kaine said Friday that he did not believe the email review would lead to anything significant, pointing to Comey's decision not to recommend charges after the FBI completed its investigation in July. <U+201C>They wouldn<U+2019>t have reached that conclusion after an investigation that went on for multiple months unless they felt that they could say it with some certainty,<U+201D> Kaine said. Kaine also disputed the notion that the FBI<U+2019>s decision signaled that the case had been reopened. <U+201C>They didn<U+2019>t say it was closed,<U+201D> Kaine said of Comey<U+2019>s July address. <U+201C>They said no reasonable prosecutor would take this case <U+2013> it wasn<U+2019>t a close decision to even say that.<U+201D> By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

The silent majority has seen me put on my head scarf in the morning and take it off at night. The silent majority has touched my face, done my makeup, watches <U+201C>Gilmore Girls<U+201D> religiously. The silent majority occasionally enjoys sliced mango before bed. We fought; I packed. This was Tuesday evening, so I headed to my friend<U+2019>s dorm, where a small group of us, mainly black women, tried to find solace in one another as the country slowly fell to red. I tried and failed to speak, to write. I ignored my roommate<U+2019>s lengthy texts. Did she really expect me to respect her choice when her choice undermined my presence in this country, in this university, in my very own dorm room? Did she really expect me to shake her hand for supporting a candidate who would love to bar my relatives from this country, who has considered making people of my faith register in a specific database and carry special ID, Holocaust-style? What with the standstill of loyalties in this election, it is no surprise that our argument proved hopeless. There was no reasoning with her, but my goal today is not to reason with her. I know perfectly well <U+2014> by the nature of this very platform, by the type of person who would click on this article <U+2014> that I am preaching to the choir. My roommate<U+2019>s reasoning reflected an <U+201C>us versus them<U+201D> mind-set that has defined this nation for as long as it has existed, that explains the very core of Donald J. Trump<U+2019>s appeal. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s canned last-minute appeals to <U+201C>one united people<U+201D> does not change the fact that the world feels very different to me today. I<U+2019>ve always found refuge and clarity in the streets of New York City. After the vote was all but called at 3 in the morning, I wandered around Times Square with two equally bewildered friends. Drifting through the empty blue streets, witnessing the ugly truth illuminated by billboards, was more surreal than I could have imagined. The emboldened silent majority speckled the streets, sporting their red <U+201C>Make America Great Again<U+201D> caps. I was struck by a feeling that their caps were a military uniform, that our country was at civil war, and that I was a target. The way we eyed one another warily seemed to confirm this sentiment. And in fact, this exact dynamic seems to be playing out on college campuses around the country. During a job interview recently, I was asked about the audience that I write for. I responded instantly: people who do not look like me. People I can shock with my multifaceted existence <U+2014> the fact that I am Muslim and an ardent feminist, a child of immigrants and a writer in English. People <U+2014> mainly white people <U+2014> whom I can persuade to see reason by sharing parts of myself through stories that make me as real to them as they are to themselves. On the subway back from Times Square, I realized that I was seeing the election results as proof of my personal failure as a writer. A black friend who was with me saw the election results as proof of her personal failure as a Black Lives Matter activist. A white friend seemed to blame his choice to vote in New York rather than back home in Michigan. Everyone I was with seemed crippled by a collective lack of agency that was more difficult to watch than CNN<U+2019>s election coverage. But this is not our fault. We are not the silent majority. My roommate<U+2019>s main defense of Mr. Trump during our argument was that he didn<U+2019>t mean the <U+201C>stupid things<U+201D> he said. She had the privilege to dismiss his words, just as he has the privilege to dismiss mine. But today, I have woken up with a craving to write. Today, for the first time in a long time, my audience has changed. Now that an us-versus-them system has been voted into office, I want to write for those who feel like the latter, the <U+201C>them.<U+201D> National unity in this moment may be nonexistent, but the unity among us is real and crucial. To the first trans kid I ever met; to my Muslim and Hispanic and female friends; to my sister and my mother, both hijabis; to all of the individuals who helped me feel love on Tuesday night, who offered me water as I cried on their bathroom floors, who marched from Union Square to Trump Tower on Wednesday <U+2014> I believe in us, in our ability to regroup and find a course of action. Mobilization depends on all of us <U+2014> everyone who has been or could be a target of Mr. Trump, everyone who has been appalled by this election, at the parody of American democracy that has unfolded. We do not need to be silent. We do need to find resilience, inspiration and hope in one another. Romaissaa Benzizoune is a freshman at New York University.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Elizabeth Bernstein \n source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-have-thanksgiving-dinner-without-a-family-blowup-1479643202 \n text: There is a question I<U+2019>ve been asked repeatedly in the past few weeks: How can I sit down at a holiday table this year with relatives whose views I can<U+2019>t stand?<U+201D> The election has left Americans polarized and resentful. Emotions are high. Empathy is low. Simple, escapist solutions<U+2014>pack a bottle of bourbon or book a hotel<U+2014>may not work. (However, I will be doing both.) This year, I<U+2019>ve got some tough love. Leading experts on empathy and healing have helped devise a strategy for families to get along this holiday season: Learn to listen. This means no interrupting. No talking over the other person. No obsessing about what you<U+2019>re going to say when the other person<U+2019>s mouth stops moving. More from Bonds: On Relationships<U+2019> Elizabeth Bernstein Spiritual experts call this a form of Divine Listening. It<U+2019>s the practice of listening without conjuring up your own inner dialogue. The idea is to quiet the rational part of your mind that wants to talk back and to fix the situation. This type of listening allows you to calm down, learn about the other person<U+2019>s view, and allow him or her to be heard. And therein lies the healing. Research on empathy shows that when someone ruminates on his or her own distress, and is defensive, it is difficult to feel empathy for someone else. This is because people become aggressive or immobilized when they feel threatened. So, if you<U+2019>re feeling fragile<U+2014>too angry or defensive or sad<U+2014>skip the family table, say psychologists. Celebrate with friends who are like-minded. Take care of yourself. If you go, you<U+2019>ll need to leave two things at the door, says Emiliana Simon-Thomas, science director of the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley, and an expert on empathy: Expectations that there will be a reconciliation or meeting of the minds with people whose values are so different than yours. And the desire to be validated or affirmed. <U+201C>Those things aren<U+2019>t going to happen this year,<U+201D> Dr. Simon-Thomas says. Here is a Thanksgiving Day family peace plan: Accept your emotions. Your feelings don<U+2019>t have to dictate your actions, says Susan David, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and author of <U+201C>Emotional Agility.<U+201D> Research shows that people who suppress their feelings have a diminished sense of well-being, Dr. David says. They also find that emotions they have ignored will bubble up at the worst time. This <U+201C>amplification<U+201D> is what happens when you find yourself yelling at Aunt Gertrude across the Thanksgiving table. You can avoid this by processing your emotions. Dr. David cautions against what she calls a common cognitive bias: We judge ourselves by our intentions but others by their actions. <U+201C>People are more than just one vote,<U+201D> she says. Plan for the <U+2018>if-then<U+2019> scenario. Coach yourself on how you might respond in a calm way if a certain topic comes up. Strategies might include reminding yourself to take deep breaths, or politely excusing yourself to help in the kitchen if you need a break. Remember the other person is complex. No one is perfect. <U+201C>Everyone is trying to make sense of the world and do their best,<U+201D> says Dr. David. So try to see each family member as a well-rounded being. This doesn<U+2019>t mean you have to agree with them. But you need to recognize that they have other life experiences that have informed their views. Keep in mind what is shared. Did Grandpa teach you to ride a bike? Did you spend summers building forts with your cousins? Do your aunt and uncle love your children? Remember this. Just listen. Be silent and let the other person speak. Think of this as a spiritual practice, says Melinda Johnston, founder of the Buddhi Institute in Rochester, N.Y. This will allow the other person to be heard and to release his or her emotions, which will eventually lower the tension. The trick is to allow your rational mind, which will want to argue, to let go. It is fine to have the thought that your loved one is an idiot. But don<U+2019>t engage with your internal narrative. Think of your thoughts as clouds floating by. <U+201C>The goal is to offer each other kindness,<U+201D> says Ms. Johnston. <U+201C>And that is a gift.<U+201D> Use <U+201C>I<U+201D> but not <U+201C>you<U+201D> statements. <U+201C>I feel nervous,<U+201D> is fine. <U+201C>If someone tells me they are sad or angry or upset, I am empathic,<U+201D> says Emiliana Simon-Thomas, science director of the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. <U+201C>But using a judgmental statement<U+2014>I am upset because of what you did<U+2014>is a difficult way to start a conversation.<U+201D> Take a cue from the Zulus. They have a greeting, <U+201C>Sawubona,<U+201D> that roughly translates as <U+201C>I see you, and by seeing you I bring you into being.<U+201D> Dr. David, who grew up in South Africa under Apartheid, says we need to see our own emotions and make room for them. And we need to see others as complex human beings. <U+201C>How can we bring our country together if we can<U+2019>t bring the holiday table together?<U+201D> she says.

Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). | AP Photo The GOP will have running room in Congress to dismantle Obamacare, reform taxes and reshape the Supreme Court. By John Bresnahan and Burgess Everett 11/09/16 03:56 AM EST It<U+2019>s 2009 all over again. Except this time Republicans are in charge and Democrats have been run over. Against all odds, Republicans are suddenly looking at an emboldened House majority, a Senate majority that survived a near-death experience, and a friend in the White House <U+2014> President-elect Donald J. Trump <U+2014> for the first time in eight years. Story Continued Below Tuesday<U+2019>s astonishing victory means everything<U+2019>s on the table for Republicans: Tilting the Supreme Court in a conservative direction for years to come, repealing Obamacare, overhauling the tax code, boosting defense spending, tearing up trade deals and cutting regulations. Some of this Republicans will be able to do under <U+201C>reconciliation,<U+201D> the special parliamentary procedure that Democrats used to enact the Affordable Care Act on a party line vote in 2010. Now Republicans can <U+201C>reverse engineer<U+201D> Obamacare with Democrats powerless to stop it. Tax reform, another GOP dream dashed during the Obama years, could also happen under this process. \"A Republican president and a Republican Senate and a Republican House can do things to change this country,<U+201D> said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) as he basked in victory late Tuesday night. In a further nightmare for Democrats, Republicans can do so without the hesitation that the looming 2016 election caused the past two years. The 2018 Senate map strongly favors the GOP. And Republicans have traditionally done better in midterm elections. Trump, unlike President Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, also won<U+2019>t have to worry about nettlesome congressional investigations. While Congress will ask questions of a Trump White House <U+2013> and there are certain to be some contentious policy fights <U+2013> Republicans on the Hill will fall in line with the Trump agenda when they have to do so. By Kenneth P. Vogel and Alex Isenstadt And they'll have a prime chance to advance their agenda with the policy-lite Trump in the Oval Office. <U+201C>Earlier this year, our conference rallied around a positive and substantive agenda to keep America safe, reform our tax code, and lift our citizens out of poverty,<U+201D> said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). <U+201C>We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make these policies real, and we are focused on doing so.<U+201D> That doesn<U+2019>t mean it will be easy for Republicans. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) must navigate his rocky relationship with Trump and the many Republicans on the Hill whose positions on abortion, taxes and immigration conflict with the president-elect<U+2019>s values. <U+201C>We have wars to win, threats to be dealt with and a stagnant economy which must be revived,<U+201D> said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who opposed Trump. <U+201C>To the extent that I can help President-elect Trump, I will.<U+201D> Trump is also a mercurial figure who is used to the life of a billionaire CEO. He's never had to consult with committee chairmen and reluctant junior lawmakers. While Trump will have Vice President-elect Mike Pence and White House staffers to attend to those kinds of things, the incoming president will still have to get used to being a party leader rather than business tycoon. Trump has clearly animated the party faithful in a way that no Republican has quite matched since Ronald Reagan. That's a powerful weapon, and he can use to motivate his own rank-and-file in a way that few presidents could match. Republicans celebrate wins across the country 11/09/16 04:59 AM EST Republicans are looking at an open-ended opportunity next year to reshape American policy across an array of issue areas and the Supreme Court, with a vacancy ready to be filled due to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell<U+2019>s blockade of Obama<U+2019>s nomination of Merrick Garland. That nomination is now a moot point. Hill Republicans aren<U+2019>t betting on agreeing with Trump on every legislative issue. Foreign policy is one area of potential dissension, given Trump's praise for Russian President Vladmir Putin and tendency to abruptly change directions. Trump won<U+2019>t have free rein on spending and taxes, either. His proposals on tax reform and infrastructure spending were projected to cost trillions of dollars. With the U.S. debt already nearing $20 trillion, and a debt ceiling increase due next year, Trump may find himself butting heads with budget hawks, especially if he seeks to boost defense spending . All these things won<U+2019>t be possible at once, despite Trump<U+2019>s campaign promises. Yet Republicans play down these potential conflicts. And dozens of them have a good relationship with Pence. It will <U+201C>be fine,<U+201D> said one senior Republican aide. <U+201C>Pence would be the perfect go-between.<U+201D> Democrats, led by incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) still have some legislative leverage, especially in the Senate. Schumer rattled off a list of liberal policy priorities after winning his own reelection campaign on Tuesday evening. <U+201C>Raise the minimum wage, make college more affordable, create millions of good paying infrastructure jobs. Tackle climate change,<U+201D> Schumer said of his priorities. <U+201C>Pass comprehensive immigration reform, criminal justice reform and get a functioning Supreme Court with nine judges.<U+201D> Few of those initiatives will happen, and it won<U+2019>t be the kind of Supreme Court Schumer envisions. To pacify conservatives, Trump released a list of conservative justices that would all reinstall the rightward tilt the court had before Justice Antonin Scalia died. 2016 By Shane Goldmacher and Ben Schreckinger For now, Senate Democrats can still block a Supreme Court justice under chamber rules. But if they do, McConnell could easily turn around and unilaterally change Senate rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority, as Democrats had threatened to do if Clinton won the White House. <U+201C>They<U+2019>re not going to block a Supreme Court justice. They can't do that. I set the precedent, all they have to do is change it to a simple majority,<U+201D> outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said a day before the election. He was talking about Republicans <U+2013> but he might as well have been talking about Democrats. In fact, with Trump soon in the White House to sign legislation, the filibuster could conceivably be done away with if McConnell grows frustrated with Democrats<U+2019> using the supermajority hurdle to stymie the GOP. That depends on how much cooperation Republicans seek from congressional Democrats. For now, Senate Republicans say they will extend an olive branch to their Democratic counterparts. <U+201C>If you<U+2019>re going to solve the debt crisis and get this economy going, you<U+2019>ve got to have both sides working. Look, if either side had all the answers we would not have a democracy,<U+201D> said Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) this week. <U+201C>Both parties need to find a way to compromise.<U+201D> By Michael Grunwald By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz",

But since I<U+2019>m a Christian rather than a Buddhist, I<U+2019>m more tempted to say that it might all be a ratification of the principle, <U+201C>You get what you sow.<U+201D> \nConsider their accusation: that it was the Russkies who did the hacking and the disclosing of those emails. Is there any evidence that they<U+2019>ve shown us? None! But heaven help anyone who points that out. He will be labeled a lover and defender of Vladimir Putin as well as an American who hates America, one who dares to doubt the word of the U.S. <U+201C>intelligence establishment.<U+201D> Why, they might even insinuate that he is a communist or a communist sympathizer, as they did during the old Cold War. \nWhen it comes to U.S. national-security state accusations against Russia, Americans are supposed to do what they were expected to do during the previous Cold War: hop to, salute, pledge allegiance, and unconditionally accept the conclusions of the U.S. <U+201C>intelligence community.<U+201D> Sort of like when they were expected to blindly support the invasion of Iraq based on those WMD conclusions that were being issued by the national-security establishment. \nDon<U+2019>t ask questions. Just defer to their authority. They know what<U+2019>s best for us. They have access to information we don<U+2019>t have. They<U+2019>re just protecting <U+201C>national security.<U+201D> \nEvidence? Who needs any stinking evidence? Everyone knows that the Russkies do these sorts of things. It has to be them. Who else? \nNever mind that these people lie from time to time. Recall Director of National Intelligence James Clapper who lied under oath to Congress about the NSA<U+2019>s super-secret illegal surveillance scheme on the American people. (Of course nothing happened to him.) Or CIA Director Richard Helm<U+2019>s lying to Congress about the CIA<U+2019>s super-secret schemes in Chile to effect regime change there. (He was permitted to plead out to a misdemeanor and hailed as hero back at CIA headquarters.) \nIn fact, the subject of Chile raises the possibility that the paranoid apoplexy that these people are experiencing over Russia<U+2019>s supposed efforts to influence U.S. elections might be some sort of psychological payback for all the things that the U.S. national-security establishment has done to influence elections in other countries. \nIn the 1960s, one could be forgiven for concluding that the CIA was a super-secret political party in Chile, given the millions of dollars that the CIA spent to support its candidates in Chile<U+2019>s elections. Of course, that wasn<U+2019>t the worst of it. When the 1970 presidential election failed to go the CIA<U+2019>s way, it bribed members of the Chilean legislature, bribed national food truckers to go on strike, assassinated an innocent man (Rene Schneider, the head of Chile<U+2019>s armed forces), orchestrated a violent military coup that left the democratically elected president of Chile dead, and then supported a regime that raped, tortured, executed, and assassinated thousands of innocent people, including two innocent Americans, Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi . \nAnd they<U+2019>re complaining of a few hacked emails belonging to some U.S. political hacks? \nDon<U+2019>t forget Guatemala. When the Guatemalan people elected Jacobo Arbenz to be their president, U.S. national-security state officials were outraged because he was a socialist (just like Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, who brought us Social Security and Medicare). So, the CIA did some interfering with that election by instigating a violent military coup in Guatemala, one that sent that nation into a 30-year civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people. \nWhat about Iran, where the CIA decided that it would do a some influencing in an election in that country by instigating a coup that ousted the democratically elected prime minister of the country? Americans and Iranians are still paying the price for that bit of influencing. \nLest anyone think that those democracy-busting regime changes are ancient history and that the U.S. national-security establishment has reformed itself, let<U+2019>s not forget the massive amount of weaponry and foreign aid that is poured into the coffers of Egypt<U+2019>s brutal military dictatorship, which ousted a democratically elected president it didn<U+2019>t like. \nIf there weren<U+2019>t so many innocent people who have suffered death, rape, torture, execution, and assassination from U.S. interference with the elections of other countries, the rank hypocrisy would be rather humorous. The simple fact of the matter is that U.S. officials lack moral standing to complain about any foreign regime<U+2019>s supposedly influencing U.S. elections. \nI<U+2019>d be remiss if I failed to point out one humorous aspect of this karmic or you-get-what-you-sow experience. U.S. officials just arrested a national-security state official and charged him with stealing U.S. national-security secret secrets. What are the secrets he stole? He stole secret codes that enable U.S. officials to hack into the computers of foreign regimes! How<U+2019>s that for a bit of dark irony? It<U+2019>s just a matter of time before they say that Putin is using the codes that their man stole to hack into the email accounts of Democratic Party hacks. \nOne final question: Why are U.S. officials and their mainstream press supporters complaining that everyone is reading those Democratic Party emails? As those people say to Americans who have had their emails, Internet visits, and telephone calls monitored by the NSA, if you have nothing to hide, what are you worried about?

        "input": "time: null \n author: Louis Nelson Eli Stokols Jack Shafer \n source: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-obamacare-employees-230284 \n text: Republicans were handed a gift when the Obama administration announced two weeks before Election Day that Obamacare premiums are set to soar next year. By Louis Nelson and Eli Stokols 10/25/16 01:58 PM EDT Updated 10/25/16 01:26 PM EDT DORAL, Fla. <U+2014> Standing beside his shimmering green golf course, Donald Trump had the political equivalent of a tap-in putt <U+2014> news that Obamacare premiums are set to shoot up next year. He muffed it. Story Continued Below At a campaign event at his Miami-area golf resort Tuesday morning, Trump said President Barack Obama<U+2019>s signature Affordable Care Act legislation is <U+201C>just blowing up,<U+201D> blaming the controversial law for his employees<U+2019> struggles with health care, but once again he made a mess of his attack. Speaking with Trump National Doral Miami resort employees behind him, the GOP nominee pledged to <U+201C>repeal and replace<U+201D> Obamacare, which he said has raised health care costs for those who buy insurance through exchanges created by the legislation. <U+201C>And I can say all of my employees are having a tremendous problem with Obamacare. You folks, this is another group. Is that a correct statement?<U+201D> he said, gesturing to the crowd. <U+201C>You look at what they<U+2019>re going through with their health care is horrible because of Obamacare. So we<U+2019>ll repeal it and replace it. But this is about jobs. And we have thousands of employees in Florida.<U+201D> Moments later, Trump appeared to contradict himself, stating that his employees don<U+2019>t have to deal with Obamacare exchanges because his corporation provides them with health care coverage. <U+201C>These are just amazing people,<U+201D> Trump said. <U+201C>This is what jobs do. Jobs just make lives and they make people and they make families and they<U+2019>re not worried about their health care because we take great care of people.<U+201D> The announcement on Monday from the White House, that premiums for benchmark Obamacare plans are scheduled to soar 25 percent next year, would in any other election year be devastating news for the Democratic presidential candidate, especially so close to Election Day. But Trump<U+2019>s campaign has been dragged into the gutter in recent weeks, struggling under the weight of multiple allegations of sexual assault against the GOP nominee and a 2005 recording in which he used vulgar language to describe sexually predatory behavior. After weeks playing defense, Trump seemed to fumble his chance to finally go back on the offensive. In a telephone interview with Fox News shortly after his Doral event Tuesday morning, Trump seemed to misunderstand how the Affordable Care Act works, telling his interviewers that <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t much use Obamacare, I must be honest with you, because it is so bad for the people and they can<U+2019>t afford it.<U+201D> But employer-provided health care is wholly separate from Obamacare insurance, which is designed to offer health plans to Americans who do not get insurance from their job. Trump said of Obamacare, <U+201C>We don<U+2019>t use it. So you know, when they interviewed those people, they<U+2019>re happy with their health coverage.<U+201D> At his own campaign stop Tuesday in Ohio, Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence offered a more successful critique of Obamacare, jabbing the president for celebrating the third anniversary of its launch earlier this month. <U+201C>He actually, get this, I<U+2019>m not making this up. President Obama last week compared Obamacare to the Samsung Galaxy 7 phones that have spontaneously burst into flames. Did you hear about that?<U+201D> Pence said. <U+201C>He actually <U+2014> I got a quote <U+2014> he actually said, <U+2018>When one of these companies comes out with a new smartphone and it has a few bugs, what do they do? They fix it, they upgrade it. Unless it catches fire, then they pull it off the market.<U+2019> Well, what a coincidence Mr. President, because that<U+2019>s exactly what we<U+2019>re gonna do with Obamacare. We<U+2019>re gonna pull it off the market. We<U+2019>re gonna repeal it lock, stock and barrel.<U+201D> Trump<U+2019>s Tuesday morning comments at Trump National Doral Miami preceded about 10 minutes of informal testimonials from employees at the golf resort, which the GOP nominee<U+2019>s corporation purchased in 2012. All said they were supporting <U+201C>Mr. Trump,<U+201D> who repeatedly reminded reporters that the event was impromptu and not at all planned, but he did joke about pressuring them to say nice things about him. <U+201C>This guy better say <U+2018>good,<U+2019><U+201D> Trump said as he called a Hispanic man to the microphone. <U+201C>Or else I<U+2019>ll say, <U+2018>You<U+2019>re fired.<U+2019><U+201D> As he walked away from the event, which was held on a patio outside the resort<U+2019>s grand ballroom and on the edge of the manicured golf course, Trump responded to a shouted question about whether his employees are on Obamacare plans by saying, <U+201C>Some of them, but most of them, no.<U+201D> Following just behind Trump, David Feder, managing director of Trump National Doral Miami , further clarified to reporters that <U+201C>very few<U+201D> employees would have reason to buy Obamacare policies because <U+201C>95 percent<U+201D> are provided health care, which is a large portion of the resort<U+2019>s operating costs. Asked whether Trump was wrong to say that his employees were actually struggling with the president<U+2019>s landmark health care law, Feder said, <U+201C>I wouldn<U+2019>t say he<U+2019>s incorrect, I would tell you that the only employees that I know <U+2014> again I don<U+2019>t have the books in front of me <U+2014> that may purchase Obamacare are typically part-timers.<U+201D> While the 25 percent Obamacare premium increases represent a jump three times larger than this year<U+2019>s increases, there has not been a corresponding uptick in premiums for employer-based health insurance plans. Premiums for such plans, the type Trump<U+2019>s employees would receive through their jobs, increased just 3 percent this year, continuing a stretch of modest premium growth for employer-based coverage. Trump<U+2019>s Affordable Care Act attacks echoed remarks he delivered Monday night at a rally in Tampa, Florida, in which he said <U+201C>it<U+2019>s over for Obamacare.<U+201D> <U+201C>In some areas, they<U+2019>re paying 60, 70 and 80 percent more than they were paying last year,<U+201D> he told rally attendees. <U+201C>And Hillary Clinton wants to double down and make it more expensive, and it<U+2019>s not going to work. I called it when it first came out. It<U+2019>s only getting worse, and not only for you, for the country. Because our country can<U+2019>t afford it, you can<U+2019>t afford it. We<U+2019>re going to have great health care at a fraction of the cost, and you watch. It<U+2019>ll happen.<U+201D> Despite the negative news for Obamacare, Bill Clinton mostly stuck by the legislation on Tuesday during a campaign stop on his wife<U+2019>s behalf in North Carolina. The former president, who recently called Obamacare a <U+201C>crazy system,<U+201D> admitted that the legislation is not without flaws but said his wife<U+2019>s approach of addressing them without repealing the act altogether is preferable to Trump<U+2019>s repeal-and-replace proposal. He called Trump<U+2019>s plan <U+201C>a terrible idea<U+201D> because it would once again allow insurers to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions and undo the law<U+2019>s provision allowing offspring t0 remain on their parents<U+2019> health insurance plans until age 26. Repealing the law, Clinton added, would strip health insurance from <U+201C>more than 20 million people.<U+201D> <U+201C>So what would a country that was interested in being stronger together do? You<U+2019>d keep what<U+2019>s good about the law and attack the problems. She<U+2019>s the only person you can vote for that wants to do that,<U+201D> Bill Clinton said. <U+201C>He just says <U+2018>I want to repeal this law and trust me on the rest.<U+2019><U+201D> By Thomas Wright By Bill Scher By Joshua Zeitz By Jack Shafer",

Democrats said Mike Pence barely lifted a finger in defense of Donald Trump. And the two campaigns prepared for the next major pivot point in the race: Sunday<U+2019>s rematch between Trump and Hillary Clinton. The post-debate spin from the Clinton and Trump campaigns made it abundantly clear: Neither Kaine nor Pence drew blood in the occasionally tense but mostly low-wattage 90-minute showdown. Story Continued Below <U+201C>Pence wasn<U+2019>t able to move the needle,<U+201D> said Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.). <U+201C>That<U+2019>s a victory on Tim Kaine<U+2019>s part.<U+201D> Kaine <U+201C>immediately seemed off his game and felt the need to immediately begin interrupting and try to take over the debate and he failed at every level of that,<U+201D> said Nick Ayers, a top Pence aide. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t know what it was, because historically he<U+2019>s performed very well.<U+201D> While Pence<U+2019>s soothing, steady demeanor seemed to buck up Republicans who had endured a disastrous week of Trump<U+2019>s antics, the VP nominee failed to land a memorable blow against Kaine or Clinton, and openly struggled to defend Trump<U+2019>s positions and rhetoric by changing the subject. There was a demonstrable discrepancy between Pence's harsh rhetoric about Russia and Vladimir Putin and Trump's lavishing praise of the strongman. By Darren Samuelsohn and Danny Vinik And though Kaine came off as overeager and testy in his frequent disruptions of both moderator Elaine Quijano and Pence, Republicans were left with little to latch onto other than his conspicuous disruptions. <U+201C>All he did was interrupt both Gov. Pence and the female moderator,<U+201D> said Kellyanne Conway, Trump<U+2019>s campaign manager. Referring to Elaine Quijano, who is of Filipino descent, Conway added: <U+201C>I<U+2019>m married to an Asian man, I was really excited to have the first Asian-American female moderator tonight, I thought it was incredibly unfortunate to have him constantly interrupting her.<U+201D> It was clear listening to Democrats afterward that they knew Kaine was unable to notch a second definitive debate win for their ticket. They explained that Kaine was intent on challenging Pence, to take him out of his comfort zone and force him to defend Trump. <U+201C>That was his job. His job was to hold Mike Pence accountable,<U+201D> said Karen Finney, Kaine<U+2019>s chief spokeswoman. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s what you<U+2019>re supposed to do at the VP debate <U+2026> if he hadn<U+2019>t done that, the question you all would be asking me is: 'Why didn<U+2019>t he do that?'<U+201D> Kaine<U+2019>s strategy was telegraphed and relentless. He read back Trump quotes to Pence, whether it was praising Putin, criticizing Mexican immigrants or using harsh language in describing women<U+2019>s personal appearances. 2016 By Kyle Cheney , Burgess Everett and Matthew Nussbaum Pence often just shook his head and uttered, <U+201C>nonsense.<U+201D> Republicans said that was about all he could do given Kaine<U+2019>s tactics. <U+201C>I have to say that I like Tim Kaine, but Tim Kaine<U+2019>s rattling off of one example after another of some statement he says Donald Trump made often were inaccurate [and] every time were virtually distorted with no context,<U+201D> said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.). <U+201C>These are distortions of his words.<U+201D> Still, the debate was waged on Democratic terms, even if it made for uncomfortable viewing given Kaine<U+2019>s uncharacteristically aggressive demeanor. Trump<U+2019>s name was uttered more than 30 times more than Clinton<U+2019>s, according to a rough transcript, and many of those instances were specific attacks waged by Kaine intended to either draw out a defense from Pence <U+2014> or go unanswered. <U+201C>Six times tonight I have said to Gov. Pence: I can't imagine how you can defend your running mate's position on one issue after the next. And in all six cases he's refused,<U+201D> Kaine said at one point. <U+201C>Don<U+2019>t put words in my mouth,<U+201D> Pence responded. 2016 By Matthew Nussbaum Kaine tried to leave the impression that Pence wanted to talk about anything other than Trump's utterances. But Pence kept his cool, even as he spent the night dodging Kaine<U+2019>s jabs. Pence spoke passionately about his faith and pushed the same type of conservative economic plans that many Republicans have been clamoring for from Trump. And he spoke in a soothing manner that provided a stark contrast to Kaine<U+2019>s more strained denunciations of Trump and attempts to provoke a response. Democrats including Finney speculated that Pence was really looking out for his own political ambitions, specifically a potential White House bid of his own in 2020. But Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta even admitted that Pence was <U+201C>smooth<U+201D> <U+2014> not a word anyone was applying to Kaine. <U+201C>Both men did a good job in terms of expressing their own views. But there was one difference: Tim Kaine fully defended Hillary Clinton throughout the debate <U+2026> I just didn<U+2019>t hear that from Pence,<U+201D> said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Pence <U+201C>was articulate, [and] while he spoke from the heart, I believe, he had a high bar and that was to change the trajectory of the last week. That didn<U+2019>t happen.<U+201D> Matthew Nussbaum and Shane Goldmacher contributed to this report. By Michael Grunwald By Bill Scher By Thomas Wright By Joshua Zeitz",
