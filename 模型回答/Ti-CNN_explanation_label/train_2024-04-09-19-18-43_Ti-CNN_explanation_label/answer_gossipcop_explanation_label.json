But what I saw happening was, if I let my fans into my life and my feelings and what I’m going through my vulnerabilities, my fears, my insecurities it turns out they have all those things, too, and it kind of connects us.”\n\nNot only has it connected her and her fans, but it also leaves people dissecting each and every one of her songs to find out which of her romances they are about — and there are many to choose from.\n\nMost of Swift’s relationships haven’t been all that long-lasting, but they’ve all been known to fuel the tabloids along with rumors that they’re PR stunts.\n\nHowever, she’s somehow managed to keep her most recent relationship with actor Joe Alwyn under wraps — and they've been dating for over three years now! But that doesn’t mean there isn’t some interesting stuff going on right under our noses.\n\nHere are a few weird details about Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn's relationship.\n\nBecause behind every talented songstress is a man supporting her (hopefully).\n\nTaylor Swift and Joe Alwyn dated for months without anyone knowing.\n\nIn 2017, Swift all but disappeared from the public eye, which is weird for someone who, until that point, basically had dominated the celebrity news cycle. A source close to Swift had revealed at the time that she stepped away from the spotlight as “she felt like her personal life was spinning out of control.”\n\nDuring this time, Swift and Alwyn reportedly started dating, unbeknownst to just about everyone. News of their relationship broke in May 2017 after they allegedly had already been together for months.\n\n“After what happened with Tom Hiddleston, they were determined to keep it quiet,” a source said at the time. \"Taylor has flown in via private jets and her security has made it a military-like mission to prevent her from being seen.”\n\nSwift and Alwyn started dating right after her breakup with Tom Hiddleston.\n\nOut of all of Swift’s relationships, the one with Tom Hiddleston is probably the most bizarre. Though it only lasted three months, it was quite a whirlwind.\n\nSwift and Hiddleston broke up in September 2016, and it seems her relationship with Alwyn may have started in October of that year.\n\n\"She has been going back and forth between Nashville and the U.K. for the last few months while she has been recording her album,\" a source revealed.\n\nTaylor Swift and Joe Alwyn are rarely seen together.\n\nDespite Swift being “crazy about Joe” and “really excited about their relationship,” it’s been very rare that we even catch a glimpse of them together — which is very unlike the country-pop crossover star.\n\nThis leads us to believe Alwyn has had something to do with the change of pace which, according to an insider, is likely the case.\n\n“Joe doesn't like attention or have any interest in being a celebrity,” the source said in 2017, \"She still intends to keep the relationship as private as possible. It's sacred to her and she feels that keeping it to themselves has worked out for the best.”\n\nTaylor Swift and Joe Alwyn haven't walked the red carpet together.\n\nIt’s one thing to avoid paparazzi, but throughout their relationship so far, Swift and Alwyn have also yet to walk a red carpet together.\n\nAccording to a source, this is a deliberate way for the couple to keep their relationship together. “[Taylor]’s grown up a lot in the last few years and realizes how important it is to avoid being in the limelight 24/7 in order to maintain a stable, secure relationship,” a source reportedly said.\n\nAnd the 2020 Golden Globes was the closest they ever got to actually walking a red carpet together. Although they had both attended the event and were seen together throughout the night, they had made their way down the red carpet separately.\n\nAlwyn doesn’t want to be known as 'Taylor Swift’s boyfriend.'\n\nSwift is about as popular of a celebrity as you can be. And while Alwyn has started to up his status, he’s nowhere near the star Swift is — yet. And according to a source, he doesn’t want Swift’s celebrity to eclipse his talent.\n\n“Joe is determined to make it as an actor in his own right, and not to be known just as Taylor Swift’s boyfriend,” a source close to Joe had reportedly revealed in 2018. “Taylor is really supportive of Joe’s career, and totally understands why he doesn’t want to be a red carpet fixture with her.\n\nAlwyn puts his job over everything.\n\nAlwyn’s acting career is still in its infancy, but he’s determined to make it in the industry. According to one of Alwyn’s former classmates, Alwyn is “married to his work.”\n\nIt seems Swift knows this, though, and so far, doesn’t mind. “Taylor loves that Joe is so dedicated to his career, and to making it big in his own name, and their relationship is all the happier for it,” a source revealed.\n\nAre Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn married already?\n\nIt seems as though all of Swift’s relationships up to this point have been lighthearted and fun (until they weren’t, of course, as we’ve learned in her lyrics).\n\nHowever, there have been some clues pointing to the fact that Alwyn may be the one she's ready to get more serious with. In fact, a source revealed in 2018 that she had marriage on the brain at the time. “Taylor really believes Joe is the one for her,” the insider said. “She wants to get engaged to him.”\n\nMarriage rumors resurfaced in January 2020 when fans thought they had seen Swift wearing an engagement ring in her new documentary, Miss Americana. However, there was never any official confirmation that they were (or are) actually engaged.\n\nDid Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn break up?\n\nSwift just recently dropped her newest album, Folklore, and, naturally, fans have taken to dissecting each and every one of her lyrics. In particular, fans have noted that the new album includes a lot of breakup anthems, which has, in turn, caused a lot of wondering.\n\nThe opening track itself references \"lost love.\" However, Swift took to social media to clear some things up about her new songs.\n\nOn Instagram, she wrote, “I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I’ve never met, people I’ve known, or those I wish I hadn’t. In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory.”\n\nHowever, on other tracks, Swift actually references her relationship with Alwyn in a positive light. In fact, some believe that Alwyn may have even co-written a few of Swift's new songs.\n\nMicki Spollen is a YourTango editor, writer, and traveler.

In fact, one recent report states that the actor planned to take the MIT professor to a family wedding.\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop recently reported that they debunked the rumor that Brad Pitt planned to take Neri Oxman home to meet his family. While headlines scream that Pitt feels torn between his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston, who recently ended her marriage with Justin Theroux, and Oxman, he’s chosen the architect and wants to introduce her to his mother and siblings.\n\nNot only that, but the gossip magazines already have Pitt, a father of six — including Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne — trying for a baby with his newest lady love. Of course, none of these rumors are true because Brad Pitt and Neri Oxman aren’t dating. In fact, they share a friendship and nothing more, according to Pitt’s representative. The supposed family wedding doesn’t even exist.\n\nAs for a Pitt-Aniston reunion? Don’t look for it to happen anytime soon either, because these two exes aren’t in any type of regular contact and they haven’t seen each other in a while.\n\nAs for something Pitt really did do, he recently made a surprise appearance on the Jim Jeffries Show on Comedy Central, according to a People report. Although he heard the words “you’re fired” last time he appeared, Pitt somehow made it back to the show as the always dreary weatherman that everybody loves to hate.\n\nThe surprise cameo on the show last week was Pitt’s first since last summer. Jeffries didn’t really explain much about how the weatherman returned, despite being fired, aside from briefly mentioning it.\n\nWhile it’s more fun to spin tales of exciting romance for Brad Pitt, it looks like, for now, he and Neri Oxman remain friends and have no plans to go home to meet the actor’s family and attend a wedding this summer. Should they become more than friends, no doubt everybody will know all the details sooner or later, but for now, Pitt appears to be adjusting well to life after his split with Angelina Jolie.",

The rapper’s death was ruled as accidental by the medical examiner.\n\nTMZ reports that a cocktail of other drugs were also found in his system. His blood tested positive for marijuana, cocaine and the painkiller Tramadol, and his urine tested positive for those drugs, as well as opiates such as hydrocodone, generic Dilauded, oxycodone and oxymorphone. The medical examiner did not find alcohol in his system.\n\nPeep, whose real name was Gustav Åhr, died last month in Tucson, Arizona, where he was supposed to hold a concert in support of his debut album, Come Over When You’re Sober (Part One). He was 21. Local authorities speculated that the circumstances around the rapper’s death were “suspicious,” though at the time the Tucson police department was under the assumption his death was caused by a combination of Xanax and other drugs.\n\nThe authorities said they were investigating text messages sent by a woman who’d visited Peep’s tour bus before his death. “GBC [Lil Peep] high af because of me and my friend lol,” read one allegedly. Another supposedly read, “He passed the fuck out my brother called and I tried to get him to say hi to my brother but he wouldn’t wake up.”\n\nA memorial for the rapper, who blended hip-hop with guitar-driven emo, was recently held in Long Beach, New York, featuring speakers and a public gathering.\n\nIn an interview with Pitchfork, the rapper said he never took prescriptions for depression but enjoyed taking drugs. “I just like smoking weed and whatever other drug comes my way,” He said. “I don’t like to pay for [drugs].

She knows how to balance her professional life alongside her personal life. Despite her stardom, she never forgets to give the time to her children. And the super actress followingly the super mom is Angelina Jolie. Recently, she took her kids for a fun day at the Renaissance Pleasure Fair in California. But according to the report, she was “miserable” all the time.\n\nWas Angelia Jolie “Miserable” at the Renaissance Pleasure Fair?\n\nLast Saturday, Angelina arrived at the annual medieval festival with her 10-year-old daughter Shiloh and 8-year-old son Knox. Now Radar Online is claiming that the mom of two was having a sad attitude at the event. According to one of the insiders, she was not having fun in the event as usual. The insider said:\n\n“She didn’t seem like she was having a good time at all.”\n\nAccording to the source, she was not having a good time at all in the event. The source also added that appeared to be “extremely skinny” and “very unhealthy.” Furthermore, the insider said:\n\n“I didn’t see her eating or drinking anything, either.”\n\nDespite the statement, the photos of the event of her along with her children said a completely different story. Although the site claimed that she was sad and not having a good time in the photos, she was captured with a big smile on her face. Well, looking at the photos it is very hard to say that she was sad.\n\nAnother photo shows her and her kids playing carnival games and chatting with other attendees. As a public figure it is very hard for her to keep herself far from the flash. She is always focused on the lens whereas rumors come alongside.\n\n❤️? A post shared by Angelina Jolie (@angelinajolieofficial) on May 4, 2017 at 3:48am PDT\n\nAlso read: After the divorce with her ex-husband, Brad Pitt, the news is that Angelina Jolie is marrying again. Is it true?\n\nEmotional speak of Angelina Jolie about the divorce from Brad Pitt\n\nFor the very first time, Angelina speaks out in public regarding the difficulties after the divorce. She talks about how her divorce from Brad Pitt has affected their children. During the interview with BBC News, she said:\n\n“I don’t want to say very much about that, except to say it was a very difficult time and we are a family, and we will always be a family.”\n\nFurthermore, the actress added:\n\n“It was very difficult. Many people find themselves in this situation. My whole family have all been through a difficult time.”\n\nAfter Jolie filed for divorce, there was a bitter custody battle. Eventually, the battle came to an end with an agreement in early January to seal the custody documents as they endeavor to resolve their issues and reach a divorce settlement. She explained the whole scenario to BBC News saying:\n\n? A post shared by Brad Pitt ️️️ (@bradpittoficial) on Dec 29, 2015 at 7:31am PST\n\n“My focus is my children, our children. We are and forever will be a family and so that is how I am coping. I am coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer.”\n\nWhere does Angelina see herself in the next five years? Here’s the answer by Angelina herself\n\nNo one knows the future. It’s like the future is a surprise box in a person’s life as we never know what happens next. Well, we can’t see the future but we can assume it. Same way when Angelina was asked where she sees herself in the next 5 years, she said:\n\n“I would like to be traveling around the world visiting my children, hoping that they’re just happy and doing really interesting things and I imagine in many different parts of the world and I’ll be supporting them.”\n\nMoreover, she added:\n\n“Everything I do I hope … I represent the right things to my children and give them the right sense of what they’re capable of and the world as it should be seen. Not through the prism of Hollywood or through a certain kind of life but really take them into the world where they have a really good sense and become rounded people.”\n\nMore about Angelina Jolie\n\nJolie is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian who is “getting married” to a “wealthy Brit,” reports In Touch. A little more than six months after splitting from Brad Pitt, she’s ready to wed a philanthropist businessman and is trying to speed up her divorce so she can marry him as quickly as possible.

        "input": "time: null \n author: Aili Nahas \n source: https://people.com/tv/why-kardashian-jenners-use-snapchat-filters-on-babies/ \n text: Over the weekend, Khloé Kardashian gave the world its first glimpse at her 1-month-old daughter’s face — sort of.\n\nKhloé, 33, shared the first videos of True Thompson on social media Saturday, choosing to introduce her baby girl using a popular Snapchat filter. The filter, in addition to imposing a flower tucked behind True’s right ear, also alters face shape, eye color, lashes and skin tone, creating the effect of a smattering of freckles perfectly distributed across the cheeks and nose.\n\nWhile the post was flooded with likes and sweet comments from fans, the filter also created confusion as many began to debate and speculate upon which features were really True’s.\n\n“Does the baby have freckles or is that the filter?” asked user @coldheartedqueen4life.\n\n“What is with the silly filter?” asked user @luca9557.\n\n“Does the baby really need a filter?” said user @2blackheart. “This picture is so deceiving.”\n\n“Stop with the filters,” commented user @kdotl22. “We can’t even tell her true color.”\n\n“Love her! Adorable! Congrats @khloekardashian,” wrote user @autumn.leafe. “But too funny to introduce a baby into the word with a filter on them. But that’s the Kardashian way, to cover up… But seriously, she is precious and perfect.”\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nIt’s not the first time a member of the famous family has chosen to introduce their child to the world of social media using a Snapchat filter.\n\nIn February, Khloé’s older sister Kim Kardashian West, 37, used a pink bear filter when sharing the first full photo of her youngest daughter, Chicago. In March, sister Kylie Jenner, 20, debuted her daughter Stormi‘s face using a popular filter that imposes a crown of crackling flames.\n\nKylie Jenner/Instagram\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West Shares Sweet Video of ‘Cutie’ Chicago\n\nA source tells PEOPLE that the fact that all three moms recently chose to use a filter on their little one isn’t a coincidence. The source says it’s a conscious decision made for privacy purposes — the stars feel that they are protecting their babies if they don’t show their full face. (That being said, both Kim and Kylie have since gone on to share non-filtered photos and videos of their respective daughters.)\n\nDuring the 10th anniversary special of their show last year, the family opened up about allowing their significant others and kids to appear on camera, with Kourtney Kardashian, 39, noting that “the boundaries are always changing.”\n\n“We’ll definitely go through moments where we’re like, ‘Cut the kids way back,’ ” she explained.\n\n“It’s funny now that Mason is getting older,” said Khloé of Kourtney and Scott Disick‘s 8-year-old son. “He knows. He doesn’t watch it, but I’ve heard him talk to his friends and say, ‘I’m on a TV show called Keeping Up with the Kardashians.’ I’m like, how does he know that?!”\n\n“Mason calls [the crew] the filmers,” said Kourtney. “He used to be like, ‘Are the filmers coming? I want to show them my Legos that I’m building.’ Now he’s in a phase where he’s like, ‘I don’t like when the filmers are over.’ ”\n\nFor her part, Kim said appearing on KUWTK is “such a personal choice.”\n\n“You can fall in love with someone, and it’s not their job to be on our show,” she said. “Kanye [West] respects what I do and sometimes he’s on, if he happens to be there, or will let us film if we’re at a concert. At first we were like, ‘Our kids will never be on, my daughter is not going to be on.’ But she’s always around me and she’s so cute, so I just want people to see [that] a little bit. It’s never a story revolving [around] them or about them or anything too personal. We know that we signed up for this, but our kids did not.”",

We ended it as best friends, and it was genuinely about encouraging and caring [for each other], and that was pretty remarkable for me.”\n\nBillboard\n\nSources previously told PEOPLE the pair’s relationship became difficult because of The Weeknd’s touring schedule and Gomez’s shooting commitments for her upcoming Woody Allen film.\n\nAs for reuniting with Bieber, 23 — whom she’s had an on and off relationship with since 2010 — “I’m 25. I’m not 18, or 19, or 20,” she said. “I cherish people who have really impacted my life. So maybe before, it could have been forcing something that wasn’t right.

Photo by Marco Torres\n\nwere\n\nExpecting Jay-Z to be defiant, even at 47 is akin to asking a known superstar to go out and score 30 on a given night. It's what Jay-Z does. It's what he has done for the better part of two decades, both on stage and in music.The 4:44 Tour, his latest North American light jog through the classics offers, maybe for the first time, a bit of bite and added emphasis to prove something to the world. There have been numerous reports of the tour not selling out, that it isn't meeting expectations or worse, is an abject failure solely because you can find a few decent seats on Groupon or a third-party reseller. None of those issues came into Toyota Center on Wednesday night. Well, there was the moment where Hov caught a glimpse of a man who brought his dog to the concert, but we need to build up to that moment first.Jay-Z performed 29 songs on Wednesday, which allowed for 29 different thoughts to run through my head at any given moment. Instead of fully recapping how Jay-Z, one of music's interesting yet straightforward best live performers managed to captivate an audience for damn near two hours, I'll jog through 15 separate thoughts I had during the set.Jay-Z really can't grow a proper mustache. There's a rule in life that you can't trust anyone who can't grow facial hair, and somehow Jay-Z fits that bill and yet he doesn't. Somebody trusted Jay-Z with 92 bricks, and he lost them, but somehow he didn't die of it which makes him close to immortal. Or a Highlander.\"Kill Jay-Z\" is a perfect tone-setter for this show. One, because four revolving boards are showing old Jay-Z videos and each of the still frames are getting set on fire. All of the doom and gloom, breaking up with Kanye, loving Blue and Beyonce plays out on these boards. FYI, he still loves Kanye to death and if I were a betting man, \"Otis\" and \"Runaway\" are Jay-Z's two favorite Kanye West videos.LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers showed up, ahead of their scheduled matchup with the Rockets on Thursday. Does Jay go harder when LeBron's in attendance? Cause he went super hard on stage, almost as if he were still dissing Deshawn Stevenson and Soulja Boy on behalf of the NBA's best player.Yes, that was a thing that happened in 2007. Jay-Z is as petty as I am when it comes to friends and that makes him a super best friend unless you cross him.Is it customary that when you go to a Jay-Z show, you have to wear a Yankees fitted? Or that you have to break out your Timbaland boots? Scratch that, when the weather gets anywhere near 59 degrees in Houston, those Timbs are coming out.Jay-Z has maybe three distinct national anthem style records. Those are the significant arena records that are gritty as hell and separate real Jay-Z fans from the guys who latched on with \"Empire State of Mind.\" \"PSA\" from 2003's? A definite national anthem. \"U Don't Know\" from 2001's? A full-on national anthem with a simple refrain: \"I will not lose, ever.\" The third is \"Run This Town\" from 2009's. The build-up to that song immediately makes you believe you could take on Andre The Giant with your bare hands and survive. All three were performed, almost in near succession to one another.When Jay-Z feels like really getting excited, he makes sure the crowd lights are blood red. You know he's performing the entire song when the lights go red.Thank God he cut \"Forever Young\" out of this setlist. It's a cheesy closer. \"Numb / Encore\" in honor of the late Chester Bennington? A perfect closer. Never go \"Forever Young.\"Hearing \"Allure,\" his goodbye to the drug game song frommixed in with a verse from \"Dead Presidents II,\" one of his favorite hustler records is a top 5 Jay-Z concert moment for me, and I don't care who says otherwise. Fight the guy who messed over your chopped cheese sandwich.There are zero guests for the 4:44 Tour. It's mostly Jay-Z, in a one-person show getting a lot of feelings off his chest. Even the cues where you'd think a guest would show up like Bun B for \"Big Pimpin\" or Beyoncé just to send people on a higher level for \"Family Feud\" were absent. It was a man, on a self-created mountain, performing with a band underneath him.\"4:44\" as a song is a demonstrative exercise. There's so much to unpack it outside of Jay admitting that he cheated and that he cannot perform the song while directly looking at the audience. The same guy who wrote songs about shooting his brother, selling drugs to his friends and leaving condoms in the baby seat of the mother that once dated his most significant rival (Nas) is scared to look a crowd in the eye and admitted he messed up. It's riveting theater.You can't go to a Jay-Z show and not break out rap hands. It's an ordained right from watching Jay-Z perform for over 20 years. You know the mannerisms, you know how it's going to go, and you especially do that when it's time for your moment with your song, you're going to let out a roar and try to emulate the guy on stage. The biggest fear, however, with a Jay-Z show in 2017 is that you can apparently figure out who is a diehard Hov stan since 1996 and who caught on real late and is picky about their Jay-Z fandom. Don't trust people who are picky about their Jay-Z fandom. Don't believe the people who tug at their jackets a bit tight when you're rapping \"Where I'm From\" or \"Lucifer\" or the Hov deep cuts. Don't trust people who think that \".38 revolve like the sun around the Earth\" line from \"It's Hot\" is fantastic. Why? Because a real Jay-Z fan will tell you that line was terrible, that's why.Right before \"99 Problems,\" Jay-Z singled out a guy who decided to make history. Jay-Z has seen plenty of shows and tours in his life. He's never seen someone bring a dog, without headphones (!) to a concert of his. \"I want to see him recognized and shouted out for his dedication,\" Hov said. No one decided to ask why the man brought his dog, or how he even got the dog past Toyota Center security. We just know the dog, and the manthere. About as random as the man who dressed in full Astros regalia at the parade crowd surfing.A catalog as dense as Jay's would lead to a few questionable moments on the setlist. Somehow, he spread out the list to touch nearly every era of his career. There werecuts I thought he would never perform live again (\"Allure\"). There was even an emphasis on some of hiswork with \"Beach Is Better,\" though I'm sure it was tossed in there for the Beyoncé line alone, this being Houston after all. The one weird quirk? \"99 Problems\" was the only song that had closed-captioned for the hearing impaired. Did Jay-Z individually do this because he wanted everyone in the audience to get his point? Did he do this specifically for the guy who brought his dog? We need answers.Meek Mill is on Jay-Z's mind. Tuesday night in Dallas, he spoke out about the Philadelphia rapper's latest incarceration due to riding a dirt bike in New York City. The judge considered it a probation violation since riding dirt bikes in NYC is illegal and sentenced Meek to serve two to four years in state prison in Pennsylvania. \"He's been on probation for 11 years,\" Hov said to the shock of the crowd. \"If that ain't modern day slavery and fuckery, I don't know what is. I'm not talking about a black and white issue; I'm talking about a human issue.\" Human issues are paramount these days, and with Hov, every problem becomes more considerable to speak on. The prison-industrial complex, mental health, therapy? All of it is big. Jay-Z is like Ric Flair in that way. On stage and in front of a camera? He's Jay-Z. When he's off it? He's Shawn Carter, still trying to navigate these spaces where Jay-Z would be comfortable.It's a Comfy Hov world now.When I spoke to Vic Mensa ahead of this show, he told me that performing a record like \"We Could Be Free\" made him get lost in the lyrics and the message. As he prepared himself to kick off the 4:44 Tour, he kept that word in mind.Mensa's set uses that same circular stage that Jay-Z's does but the Chicago rapper condenses his movement far more than Hov does. Songs like \"16 Shots\" get reflective lights and Mensa clutching a mike stand as if the drums and bass are hitting him dead in the chest. In other moments, such as \"OMG,\" he stands at attention, and for a twist, he put Paul Wall's \"Sittin Sidewayz\" and UGK and OutKast's \"International Players Anthem\" underneath him to make him lift higher.Clad in a jacket that was half-denim, half tribute to Michael Jackson's \"Rock With You\" video, Mensa used up a solid 30 minutes to tell his story. There were the three sides to a story narrative of \"Heaven On Earth,\" where he discussed his friend getting killed through his eyes, the eyes of his killer and the eyes of his friend wishing him success. He discussed losing love with \"Homewrecker\" and made sure to dedicate \"We Could Be Free\" to those who lost their lives to police violence and also to the 26 men, women and children who lost their lives in Sutherland Springs last Sunday. Everything was on Mensa's mind on Wednesday, and in a controlled fury, all of his thoughts spilled out. For a kicker? Malik Yusef, the Chicago poet, decided to go all-in on a poem celebrating Houston's triumph through the pain following Hurricane Harvey and the Astros winning the World Series.Before Toyota Center became a home game for Jay-Z, it felt like a home away from home for Vic Mensa too.Jay-Z has learned from Kanye in how to make a stage design a big damn deal in a one-man rap show.There are your reformed dope boys who took their ladies out. There were the women who didn't mind the cold to show off and show out. There were Astros jerseys and hats everywhere, the city still awash in the pride of a championship touching this city's lips for the first time in two decades. It was half-date night, half-stunt night in Toyota Center. Which is probably the only way a Jay-Z concert in 2017 can go.\"I thought you didn't like the Yankees!\"Moments after the show ended and the drive home began, I realized that all of the talks about the tour being a failure due to it not being as in-demand a show was bull. There's no way you can have a bad show with your favorite artist unless that artist is late as hell or skips out with plenty of time left on the clock. Jay-Z could have gone until 1 performing the hits and nobody would have minded. Well, except those who had to work the next morning.Didn't I (Say I Didn't)U MadMemories On 47th St.16 ShotsHomewreckerRollin' Like a StonerOMGHeaven On EarthDown For Some IgnoranceWingsThe Fire Next TimeWe Could Be FreeRageKill Jay ZNo Church in the WildCan I LiveLuciferD'evilsHeart of the City (Ain't No Love)Run This TownFuckwithmeyouknowigotitBeach Is Better4:44BamJigga My NiggaIzzo (H.O.V.A.)Dirt Off Your ShoulderOn to the Next OneI Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)Public Service AnnouncementFamily FeudU Don't Know99 ProblemsBig Pimpin'AllureMoonlightThe Story of O.J.Niggas in ParisWhere I'm FromEmpire State of MindHard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)SmileNumb / Encore",

Use a washcloth to exfoliate the skin prior to applying a self-tanner. Using an exfoliating product also will help remove dead skin cells. Spend a little more time exfoliating where your skin is thickest, on the elbows, knees and ankles.\n\nDry your skin. Drying your skin before you apply a self-tanner helps it go on evenly.\n\nApply in sections. Apply the self-tanner in sections (such as the arms, then legs, followed by the torso). Massage the self-tanner into your skin in a circular motion.\n\nWash your hands after each section. You will avoid orange-colored palms by washing your hands with soap and water after you finish applying the self-tanner to each section of your body.\n\nBlend at your wrists and ankles. For a natural look, you need to lightly extend the tanner from your wrists to your hands and from your ankles to your feet.\n\nDilute over your joints. Dilute the self-tanner on the knees, ankles and elbows, because these areas tend to absorb more self-tanner than the rest of the skin. To dilute, lightly rub with a damp towel or apply a thin layer of lotion on top of the self-tanner.\n\nGive your skin time to dry. Wait at least 10 minutes before getting dressed. For the next three hours, it is best to wear loose clothing and try to avoid sweating.",

Ex-lovers Robert Pattinson, 28, and Kristen Stewart, 32, attended Lily-Rose Depp’s 19th birthday party on June 1. However, don’t expect their love to rise from the grave. “There’s no chance of any kind of romantic reconciliation for Rob and Kristen,” a source close to Rob EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “That ship has well and truly sailed, and way too much has passed between them to ever reunite in that way. Plus, Kristen is really happy with Stella [Maxwell], they have an amazing relationship.”\n\nWhile there’s no chance that RPatz and KStew will date again, it’s not all bad, as the source tells HollywoodLife.com that Rob thinks it’s “great” that they’ve “finally got to a place where they can be friendly when they see each other in public. Rob would love to see more of Kristen, he still cares for her deep down, and probably always will—she was his first real love.” As for Kristen, she “feels a little awkward when she sees Rob,” because she still “carries a lot of guilt” from how their romance ended (you know, what with her cheating on him with Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders.) However, the source says that Rob has repeatedly told her that “everything is good between them, and he doesn’t harbor any bad feelings towards her.”\n\nToo bad, Twilight fans. Bella’s not getting back with Edward – or Jacob, for that matter. This should come as no surprises, as the two didn’t really seem to be that enamored with each other at Lily-Rose’s birthday party, as a source from the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles – where the bash was held – EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com that they had “very cordial conversations, but it was minimal at best.” Oh, there was no drama – but there was no real chemistry either. Oh well.\n\nPrior to the birthday bash, Robert and Kristen had a “low-key meet-up” in February 2018. Both Twilight stars were at a bar/restaurant in Los Angeles’ Silver Lake neighborhood. Eagle-eyed fans tweeted their excitement, hoping that they could “maybe start over again …but this time it means forever.” Sadly for these fans, the only way they can see Bella and Edward back together is in the pages of Stephenie Meyer’s books.",

She still asks for Halloween. It was so weird. Honestly, [she was] probably very lucky to do that.”\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

I didn’t even know if I wanted her to believe in Santa. … I had no idea which way I wanted to go with it,” Teigen said. “John and I are just like, ‘I don’t know, we’ll figure it out when she asks, I guess.’ ”\n\n“It’s definitely a stressful time, but I think now that Thanksgiving is over we can really focus and hone in on Christmas and gift-giving and just being around family,” she explained.\n\nThe proud mom said she’s “excited to shop for” Luna and her baby brother Miles Theodore, 6 months, because she can’t wait to “see them get excited about something” — even though Miles’ idea of a good time is pretty simple these days.\n\n“He’s excited about milk and that’s it,” Teigen joked, admitting “everything” her family does over the holiday season is “about photos.”\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Merry Chrissy-mas!

Jay Z is on top of the world after wife Beyonce gave birth to their twins. We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how he was especially moved to tears when he held his newborn son for the first time.\n\nDaddy’s boy! Jay Z finally has the son he’s longed for after wife Beyonce, 35, gave birth to their twins, a boy and a girl. “Jay was brought to tears when he held his new son for the first time. He is already making plans for all the things he wants to teach the boy, places he wants to take the twins and all the wonderful things they will do,” a source close to the rapper tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Jay, 47, grew up without a father, so it must be so emotional to know his son will never have that same fate. His boy will always have the guidance of a loving and caring dad at all times.\n\n“Everyone who has met the babies are already saying both kids look just like their father! Despite being stuck in the hospital, it was still the best Father’s day ever for the couple,” our insider continues. Now Jay has a mini-me that he can one day play hoops with, teach him how to rap, and follow in his dad’s footsteps. Not that Jay doesn’t completely adore his daughters, including five-year-old Blue Ivy, but there’s something about the bond between a father and son that will be so special for him.\n\n“Beyonce is eager to get her new babies home. She has been stuck inside the hospital for a week now and Jay has been by her side daily as they follow all of the doctor’s conservative orders to ensure the newborns are healthy and strong before going home,” our source adds. Unlike her smooth and “peaceful” birth with Blue Ivy, the twins have been a whole different story as both mom and the babies have remained in UCLA Medical Center for the past week since June 12.\n\nJay has stayed by her bedside since the kiddos arrived, even skipping his prestigious induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 15 because it took place in NYC. In what appears to be a good sign that his wife and new babies are doing well, he was spotted leaving a Soul Cycle class on June 19 after working up a good sweat.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think Jay and Beyonce will name their new son and daughter? Will the boy be Sean Carter Jr.? Give us your best guesses!",

The Chrisley Knows Best star runs a tight ship and he tries to always know what’s going on with his famous offspring. Recently, Savannah Chrisley opened up about her relationship with Detroit Pistons rookie Luke Kennard and it turns out that Todd has been involved in their relationship, as expected.\n\nChrisley Knows Best wrapped Season 5 on the USA network in April and there are rumors that the Chrisleys might be moving to another network. That’s probably why Savannah and Todd Chrisley appeared as guests on E’s Daily Pop.\n\nWhile they were there, co-hosts Catt Sadler, Justin Sylvester, and Carissa Culiner wanted the scoop on Savannah’s relationship with rising NBA star Luke Kennard.\n\nSavannah and Luke have been getting pretty serious lately and many fans of Chrisley Knows Best have wondered what Todd thinks of it all.\n\nDinner with the fam ❤️ @marycarlisle @rickyyoungmusic @lukekennard5 #nashvillenights A post shared by Savannah Faith Chrisley (@savannahchrisley) on Jul 8, 2017 at 8:54pm PDT\n\nIt turns out that Savannah’s famous father approves of her man. That doesn’t mean he’s letting Savannah run all over the place, though.\n\n“Honestly, I wasn’t [afraid] because, for the first time, he’s an awesome human being,” Savannah gushed.\n\n“There was no hesitation about it. It started off very pure and right. [Todd] was involved from the very beginning. That’s the way to do it.”\n\nSavannah hasn’t always been upfront with her dad about the boys she was dating. Previously, she preferred to hide her suitors from Todd Chrisley because he is strict and likely wouldn’t have liked her choice in boyfriends.\n\n“She has been a ‘Shady Sheila’ in her past,” Todd said of Savannah. “We don’t have to worry about that because Luke is a wonderful, fine young man whose integrity and morals are beyond reproach. His family is just wonderful, good, God-fearing people.”\n\nYep y'all…he's my guy 😍 could not be more proud of him!! Thank you for choosing me @lukekennard5 ❤️ #nbabound🏀 #dukenation #myboyfriendishot A post shared by Savannah Faith Chrisley (@savannahchrisley) on Jun 22, 2017 at 3:56pm PDT\n\nAs for how Savannah and Luke met, it turns out that they just happened to be eating out with their respective families in Los Angeles when Luke noticed his girlfriend’s beauty.\n\nSavannah said that they were seated near each other in a restaurant, prompting Luke to look her up on Instagram and flatter her with compliments.\n\nSavannah and Luke started dating not long after the restaurant encounter. Fast forward to now and it looks like Savannah and her basketball star boyfriend are getting pretty serious.\n\nDuring the interview, Todd complimented Savannah and Luke on their good looks. It seems that Todd values great genetics almost as much as he cares about morals and values.\n\n“They make a great looking couple,” Todd quipped. “I can’t have somebody ratchet coming in here trying to tear up my DNA.”\n\nSavannah took the bait and started talking about babies. The Chrisley Knows Best star said that she can’t handle having an ugly baby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt sounds like Savannah Chrisley and Luke Kennard are pretty serious and possibly even headed for the altar. Good thing Todd Chrisley approves.",

The trip was a significant milestone for the 37-year-old reality star, and she wrote on her website about what it was like to return for the same event—Paris Fashion Week—and how her life has changed since the experience.\n\n\"I went back to Paris to witness Kanye's BFF, Virgil Abloh, make history with his first collection and runway show for Louis Vuitton during Mens Fashion Week. It was such an emotional trip!\" KKW wrote in a blog post on her site. \"For me, it was the perfect time to come back to a place where I fell in love, but also a place where I suffered great trauma.\"\n\nKardashian West explained that she was only in France for 12 hours before returning to the United States for Teyana Taylor's listening party (Kanye West produced the singer's upcoming album). Kardashian West also said that having her husband with her and beefing up her security made her feel more safe. \"Emotionally, I feel calm. I've truly put the experience behind me, and have learned and grown from it. Because of this, mentally coming back to Paris wasn't difficult for me,\" she wrote. \"It feels refreshing to face my fears and overcome them. For me, there's no point in staying in a f---ed-up state of mind. 'Feel it, go through it and move on' has always been how I try to live my life. I would never suggest to anyone how to grieve, I can simply say what has worked for me.\"\n\nKim has spoken candidly about her experience in the past two years, including her use of crystals to help her heal emotionally. However, she has also documented how hard it still is for her to feel safe while traveling and has become an outspoken gun control advocate.\n\n\"I'm not against guns and I'm not against people owning guns. After what happened to me in Paris, I know how important it is to be safe and to have armed security,\" she explained. \"All of my security is armed, but they also support stricter gun control laws and believe that we should restrict access to firearms for people with mental illness, anyone previously convicted of a misdemeanor, those who have been subject to a temporary restraining order and those at a higher risk of committing gun violence.\"\n\nRelated: French Police Arrested 17 People in Connection With Kim Kardashian West's Paris Robbery",

One wanted a presidential pardon for Alice Marie Johnson, a grandmother serving life in prison without parole for a drug crime. The other wanted a presidential pardon for Dinesh D’Souza, America’s greatest troll.\n\nGuess which star became a media joke?\n\nKim Kardashian West met Donald Trump in the White House Wednesday to lobby for prison reform and to ask him to pardon Johnson, who went to jail more than 20 years ago after getting involved in a cocaine ring. In a viral interview, Johnson told Mic that her son had died, she’d been divorced, and she needed the money. “I couldn’t find a job fast enough to take care of my family,” she told Mic. “I felt like a failure.”\n\nKardashian was moved by the interview.\n\nThis is so unfair... https://t.co/W3lPINbQuy — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) October 26, 2017\n\nTrump heard out Kardashian. Then he released a photo of the two of them in the Oval. The media pounced. It wasn’t criticism; it was an assault.\n\nGreat meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing. pic.twitter.com/uOy4UJ41JF — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018\n\nThe New York Post went with not one, but two references to Kardashian’s rear end on its Thursday cover. The image was retweeted and liked thousands of times.\n\nTomorrow's cover: Kim Kardashian visits the White House to discuss prison reform with President Trump https://t.co/1N3bNkVmK7 pic.twitter.com/yPaL93Tyhe — New York Post (@nypost) May 30, 2018\n\nIt’s tempting to say that Kardashian just isn’t serious. She’s a reality star. She makes millions selling a brand on top of questionable products. But Trump, too, is a reality star. He, too, makes millions selling a brand on top of questionable products. The difference is that Trump is the modern male archetype. Kardashian is his female foil.\n\nThe reaction to Kardashian is a window into how we think about male and female leadership. Trump is an alpha man who never backs down, never apologizes, and never accepts “no.” He gets to be president. Kardashian is the modern female archetype — she is thin (except in the places it’s difficult to be plump), she is ageless, and she glamorizes motherhood. Her politicking is treated as a joke.\n\nCelebrities draw attention to causes all the time — and it works. The media flocks to cover events when big names get involved in policy. Whether it’s Bono testifying on the state of AIDS resources, Brad Pitt meeting with Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi on sustainable housing, or Ashley Judd taking on saving wolves, the coverage usually takes them seriously along with the issue.\n\nTrump’s rise is proof of the phenomenon. He was irresistible to TV news during the 2016 campaign. He still is.\n\nBut even advocates of prison reform didn’t see Kardashian, perhaps the best publicity-getter in America, as any kind of help. In a response to my colleague German Lopez’s explainer on yesterday’s meeting, Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, wrote him the following email:\n\nPresident Trump’s reported meeting with Kim Kardashian West to discuss prison reform makes light of one of the biggest crises that we face in our country today. Prison reform is a complex issue that requires expertise and knowledge of where some of the greatest racial disparities lie. I am not aware that Ms. Kardashian West brings the requisite record of experience to tackle these issues on a national scale. In short, this proposed meeting is outrageous and makes clear that this administration does not deem prison reform a real priority.\n\nMany organizations rely on celebrities to draw attention to their cause. Clarke’s organization, for example, has highlighted “special guests” at their annual gala, like Laz Alonso, a Hollywood star from box office hits like Avatar; Mike Tomlin, head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers; and Jim Nantz, a CBS sports personality.\n\nPerhaps the only person better at using celebrity for promotion than Trump is Kardashian. But when she takes up a cause, no matter how significant, her role as a feminine icon overshadows it. We laugh at the idea of the perfect woman having something important to say. But it’s not funny at all.",

Guests usually arrive in the early afternoon on Christmas Eve and exchange gifts. After their church outing on the big day, the royal family heads back to Sandringham House for a lunch of Norfolk turkey and other festivities.\n\nTim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock\n\nMeghan joined the royal family for their Christmas celebrations last year, despite it being unusual for non-married partners of senior members of the family to join the Queen for Christmas Day celebrations. Despite being engaged to William, in 2010 Kate spent her last Christmas as a single woman with her own family. But, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have any family in the U.K. — and clearly Harry will have wanted his new fiancée by his side.\n\nDespite reports that Prince William and Kate Middleton would likely be spending the holiday with Kate’s family in Bucklebury, the couple will be joining the rest of the royal family. They will stay at their nearby home of Anmer Hall with children Prince George, 5, Princess Charlotte, 3, and 8-month-old Prince Louis.\n\nChris Jackson/Getty\n\nClaims have swirled about tension between brothers William and Harry and their wives, Kate and Meghan. But contrary to those reports, a source tells PEOPLE that the couples enjoyed a memorable first Christmas together last year, when Meghan made her debut walk to church with the royal family on Christmas Day.\n\n“They really loved Christmas and all had a wonderful time,” the source says. “I think the two women got on — they are definitely not best friends, but it was a really special time for them all to spend together.”\n\nBEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty\n\nOne person who won’t be joining in the festivities? Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland.\n\nDespite previous reports that Doria was invited to spend Christmas with the royal family, PEOPLE confirms that the Los-Angeles based yoga instructor and social worker will not be in Norfolk.\n\nThe Middletons have never joined the royals for Christmas, but Kate and William decided to skip spending Christmas at Sandringham in 2016. Instead, they brought Prince George and Princess Charlotte to church with Kate’s family in Englefield, England, near her childhood home.\n\nThe news comes shortly after PEOPLE confirmed that Doria will not be moving in when Meghan and Harry leave Kensington Palace for their new home at Windsor Castle’s Frogmore Cottage next year. Doria may have rooms set aside for her in the cottage, located close to the house where Harry and Meghan’s evening wedding party was held and where their engagement photos were taken about a year ago, but she’s not making a permanent move there.",

So who are the social-media all-stars, who can amass nearly 400,000 retweetsfor a mere 13-second clip of a band member sleeping? We explore the phenomenon behind the breakout group.\n\nWHO THEY ARE: BTS is a South Korean boy band consisting of seven members ages 20 to 25, whose stage names are RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, V, Jimin and Jungkook. After a series of lineup switches by management Big Hit Entertainment, the current iteration of the band was formed in 2013, when they released their first album, 2 Cool 4 Skool. Although their Korean name, “Bangtan Sonyeondan,” literally translates in English to “Bulletproof Boy Scouts,” they announced this summer that they were changing it to “Beyond the Scene,” as part of a shift to a more progressive, mature brand identity.\n\nWHERE YOU’VE HEARD THEM: In September, BTS became the first K-pop act in history to hit the top 10 of the Billboard 200 album chart, where their fifth EP, Love Yourself: Her, debuted at No. 7 with 31,000 equivalent album units, according to Nielsen Music. Their popularity continued to surge this fall, with candy-coated single DNA peaking at No. 67 on the Hot 100 singles chart in October, and performances of the EDM-tinged track on the American Music Awards and The Ellen DeGeneres Show last month. They’ve also collaborated with U.S. artists including The Chainsmokers (Best of Me), Steve Aoki and Desiigner (Mic Drop, whose remix debuted at No. 28 on the Hot 100 this month).\n\nWHY THEY’RE HUGE: The BTS ARMY, as they call themselves, is one of the mightiest fandoms in music right now, with factions in America and abroad running countless fan pages online, and snapping up tickets to their completely sold out world tour this year.\n\nBut why have they inspired such a feverish devotion? For starters, they’re filling a void left by another cobbled-together band of international heartthrobs, the U.K.’s One Direction, who split up in 2015 to pursue successful solo careers. Their good looks, goofy interviews and unguarded, relatable posts on their personal social media accounts are all fawned over incessantly, with each of the guys averaging roughly 2.5 million Instagram followers or more (with more than 20 million fans across their band’s official Twitter, Instagram and Facebook pages).\n\nAnd while their fan base does skew heavily toward young women — many of whom connect with other fans globally through the ARMY Amino app, and have lists of chants rehearsed for every concert — the band’s fusion of other genres such as rap and Moombahton into their music has helped broaden their appeal. Online music service Melon, for instance, found that male users in their 20s and 30s tended to listen to recent single Blood, Sweat and Tears more than female fans.\n\nPerhaps most crucially, they stand out from other K-pop bands because of their empowering messages for young people who feel like they’re outcasts and underdogs. Songs like Whalien 52 and The Last address mental illness and depression head on, while others such as Spine Breaker and Change featuring Wale take on consumerism, racism and politics.\n\n“They go a lot deeper than a lot of K-pop music,” says Jeff Benjamin, who writes about K-pop for Billboard. “I think that’s one of the main reasons BTS has been able to break out as big as (they have). They really try to make music that’s socially conscious.”\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: Guesting on On Air with Ryan Seacrest, BTS teased the possibility of releasing English-language versions of their hit songs.",

But I definitely say I’m a different person, and I’m supposed to be,” she said. “It’s a good thing.”\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Shereé Whitfield On Kenya Moore Post-Wedding: ‘She’s Actually A Nicer Person Now!’\n\nThe other major change for Williams is that she’s cooled her jets on her quest for motherhood, something she attributes to time spent with her 1½-year-old niece Baleigh.\n\n“Every time I’m around my niece, she gives me baby fever. But that’s the thing about baby fever. You have it, and then you get well again,” Williams said. “I’m okay right now. I’m not going to have a baby until I’ve found that right guy. And I’m sure once I find him, that’ll be one of the first things we do.”\n\n“For me, I’ve thought of a lot of creative ways I can make that happen without a man.

Simpson has been paroled.\n\n(Getty)\n\nYes, it looks like the football great and likely double-murderer might be a free man as early as October 1.\n\nThe 70-year-old Simpson, of course, is one of the most notorious public figures in America.\n\nAs a result, it stands to reason that the question of what he’ll do after his release is looming large today.\n\nWill he write another ill-advised memoir, or did he learn his lesson the first time?\n\nWill he attempt to re-enter public life, or simply lay low?\n\nAnd, of course, will the Juice make an appearance on Maury to settle the most famous paternity mystery since Jon Snow?\n\n(E!)\n\nAs you may have heard, a rumor that O.J. is Khloe Kardashian’s father has been circulating on the Internet for years and years.\n\nProponents cite several pieces of “evidence,” including the fact that Kris Jenner and Simpson ran in the same social circles.\n\n(The physical dissimilarities between Khloe and her sisters is perhaps the biggest driver of this long-running theory.)\n\nOne thing that is fact, father than fiction, is that at the time of his arrest for double murder, Simpson was tight with the family.\n\nO.J. was so close with the Kardashians that they were prominently featured in the FX miniseries about the Simpson trial.\n\nSo some considered it strange that the 33-year-old Khloe didn’t comment on the news of Simpson’s impending release.\n\nAnd the Internet being the Internet, a handful of folks flocked to Khloe’s Instagram page to try and coax a comment out of her.\n\nKhloe posted the above pic to her Instagram page yesterday, and not surprisingly, many of the comments had little to do with the photo.\n\nO.J. was the news of the day, and the reactions to Khloe’s photo reflected that … sometimes amusingly, other times inappropriately.\n\n“Dad’s on his way home from that vacation your mom told you about when you were a kid,” joked one fan.\n\n“The face you make when you find out Daddy’s home #oj,” commented another.\n\n“Your dad is out of prison girl, u must be thrilled,” wrote a third.\n\nEventually, Khloe broke Internet Rule Number One and fed the trolls, but she did so without debasing herself by engaging in one-on-one arguments.\n\n“People are a–oles but I don’t care lol. I focus on the good,” Khloe wrote. “They are all f-cked lol such a–holes.”\n\n“Hehe oh well… I’m happy and they hatin’.”\n\nJokes are one thing, but mean-spirited comments made directly to Khloe without an iota of wit are uncalled for.\n\nAnd, as many fans pointed out, in some cases, they’re disrespectful to the late Robert Kardashian Sr. (with O.J., above).\n\nThe elder Robert Kardashian died in 2003 at the age of 59; Kris Jenner and Kardashian married in 1978 but later divorced.\n\nFortunately, Khloe’s been in the spotlight for the better part of two decades, so she knows exactly how to handle this sort of thing by now.",

Angie loves Target. It’s one of her favorite stores, and it’s where she buys lots of Christmas gifts. Walking around with her shopping cart makes her feel happy.”\n\nGossip Cop stressed that there’s no truth to such claims, and reiterated that it all started after Radar Online published a story about Jolie struggling with her finances. The tabloid claimed that Jolie has opted to buy discounted items at Target because of her money problems.\n\nHowever, there’s also no truth to such rumors because the actress’ net worth is roughly around $160 million. She has just completed a series of successful projects, namely, “First They Killed My Father” and “The Breadwinner,” which generated huge sums of money.\n\nMeanwhile, Jolie was also spotted at Target with her two kids, Shiloh, and Vivienne in August. The trio wanted to buy food at the store, but immediately left Target after they learned that it was no longer available.\n\nGossip Cop also stressed the fact that there’s no truth to the claims made by the sister sites because even their statements contradicted each other. Last week, Radar Online quoted their source, “Walking around with her shopping cart makes her feel normal again.”\n\nNational Enquirer, on the other hand, wrote, “Walking around with her shopping cart makes her feel happy.”\n\nBut regardless of where Jolie wants to shop, the most important thing is that she gets to spend time with her six children. The single mom has joint custody of her kids with Brad Pitt. The actor only has visitation rights to see their children, but all six of them are living with Jolie under one roof.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images/Dia Dipasupil",

That is not her style. But Ben’s insensitive actions have changed her. She could never really trust Ben. He is no longer hiding his relationship with girlfriend Lindsay, and Jen has hit a breaking point.”\n\nAccording to Star, Garner has turned to the Church of Scientology for help.\n\nThe famous actress has been feeling tired, going through sleepless nights, and is hoping that Tom Cruise’s controversial church will help her get back on her feet.\n\nGarner is allegedly doing therapy and trying other alternative techniques that can help her mental state and physical well-being.\n\nA person on her team claimed that the story is not true and that Garner regularly attends the Community United Methodist Church.\n\nThis is not the first time, Garner has been linked to Church of Scientology.\n\nAndrew Morton, author of Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography, claimed in 2004, Garner and an extensive list of Hollywood stunners were contacted by the action movie star to be his wife.\n\nMorton wrote: “Cruise left messages on the Alias star’s voice mail in 2004 asking “if she knew what freedom was,” but his advances were rebuffed ..

There went a great one. There’s nobody like Harry Dean. Everyone loved him. And with good reason. He was a great actor (actually beyond great) – and a great human being – so great to be around him!!! You are really going to be missed Harry Dean!!! Loads of love to you wherever you are now!!!“\n\nDirector Monte Hellman made “Ride in the Whirlwind” (1966), “Two Lane Blacktop” (1971), and “Cockfighter” (1974) with Stanton. He told Variety that he met Stanton through Jack Nicholson “back when they were roommates.” Hellman said that Stanton “had the same quality as all great actors and I think Harry summed it up best himself when he told me some advice Jack had given him. It was ‘Let the wardrobe do the acting.’ He was one of a kind and he didn’t have a bad angle. You could him up, down, left, right and he always looked great. He did have an actor’s ego and did want to garner more lead roles. I remember on ‘Two Lane Blacktop’ he thought he should have been cast in the Warren Oates part. He was also very upset when he discovered, on location in Oklahoma, that the character was a gay hitchhiker. This was 1970 and he was a little bit old-fashioned in his thinking then. Actually, he was so pissed off, he almost quit. But then he delivered what I believe is one of the most moving performances of his life.”\n\nShawn Doyle, who acted with Stanton in “Big Love,” tweeted a tribute. “You could watch him on set say a line as simple as ‘hello,’ and be mystified why it was so friggin compelling.”\n\nYou could watch him on set say a line as simple as \"hello\", and be mystified by why it was so friggin compelling. #RIPHarryDeanStanton — Shawn Doyle (@Shawndoyle) September 15, 2017\n\nHorror film director John Carpenter, who directed the actor in “Escape From New York,” tweeted, “Harry Dean Stanton was a wonderful man, kind and full of humor.

That would be coffee. Saturday, Sept. 29, is National Coffee Day, and in celebration of the most important day of the year, I’ve rounded up the best caffeine-infused beauty products from Birchbox to wake you up and keep you going. Ingesting coffee does one thing for your insides, but on your skin? That’s a whole other (wonderful) story.\n\n“Coffee is useful in skincare because it’s rich in antioxidants that protect the skin, as well as caffeine to help the body get rid of excess fluid,” Dr. Joshua Zeichner, Director of Cosmetic and Clinical Research at Mount Sinai Hospital, tells Elite Daily. “Applying caffeine topically may improve the appearance of both cellulite and undereye puffiness, and by helping constrict blood vessels, it flushes away excess fluid that accumulates which makes the fat look more prominent,” he says.\n\nNot only is coffee an anti-inflammatory, explains Zeichner, but it can help reduce redness, while antioxidants prevent skin damage from free radicals. “Topically applied, caffeine may help protect against some skin cancers at the molecular level,” he says.\n\nCheck out these Birchbox faves for caffeine-infused picks that won’t have you yawning. I promise.\n\nCourtesy of Birchbox\n\nORIGINS GinZing™ Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer ($29.50, birchbox.com)\n\nAn oil-free moisturizer infused with panax-ginseng and coffee beans, the Origins GinZing gel will boost your skin’s radiance and hydration each morning. This pick is one of Origin’s best sellers and is light, but hydrating enough, for cooler fall temperatures.\n\nKiehl’s Eye Fuel ($22.50, birchbox.com)\n\nLike food for your undereyes, the Kiehl’s Eye Fuel will hide all traces of a hangover or a restless night's sleep. The cooling cream contains caffeine and Vitamin B3 to instantly reduce puffiness and dark circles.\n\nCourtesy of Birchbox\n\nEstée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Intensive Recovery Ampoules ($112, birchbox.com)\n\nDon’t be fooled by their size—these ampoules are stronger than they appear. Each ampoule contains ChronoluxAI technology to help reduce visible irritation and soothe stressed out skin. Unlike other coffee-infused products that you slather on in the AM, Estee Lauder suggests applying this formula in the PM, after your serum and before your moisturizer.\n\nCourtesy of Birchbox\n\nClarins Detox Booster ($39, birchbox.com)\n\nThis green juice for the skin helps bring your complexion back to life. Enriched with green coffee extract, a plant from tropical Africa and rich in caffeine, this booster should not be used alone—mix in 3-5 drops with your favorite moisturizer, serum or mask or foundation.\n\nARROW REVITALIZE Undereye Brightening Serum ($18, birchbox.com)\n\nThis undereye makeup pen not only conceals dark circles and puffiness, but the ginseng and caffeine-infused formula works to instantly soothe puffy bags. Bonus: the product comes in two shades, including light/medium and medium/deep.\n\nCourtesy of Birchbox\n\nJUARA Coffee & Creme Skin Smoothing Body Ritual ($58, birchbox.com)\n\nReinvigorate your body with this two-step skincare system, including a body scrub and body moisturizer. Infused with Indonesian coffee beans and candlenut oil, you’ll forget you’re actually in your shower and not the trendy coffee shop down the street.\n\nCourtesy of Birchbox\n\n100% Pure Organic Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream ($26, birchbox.com)\n\nNot only does this pick contain caffeine from coffee beans, but it also uses green tea to de-puff undereyes while increasing circulation. It’s formulated with natural and organic ingredients, like antioixdants and rosehip oil, for a gentle yet effective treatment.",

        "input": "time: 2018-07-13 \n author: Debra Birnbaum \n source: https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/this-is-us-dan-fogelman-emmy-nominations-season-3-1202872412/ \n text: “This Is Us” solidified its stance as both an audience favorite and an awards contender, grabbing eight nominations for its sophomore season, including best drama and lead actor for its leading men, Sterling K. Brown (the reigning champ) and Milo Ventimiglia.\n\n“This is what really matters,” joked series creator and executive producer Dan Fogelman, in an interview with Variety. “This is the stuff. Not family, not health — it’s Emmy nominations.”\n\nBut in all seriousness, Fogelman says he’s “thrilled” to be part of the awards conversation — and to be representing for broadcast, as the lone network contender in the drama race. “The goal when I sat down was to try and make something that was high quality while at the same time being accessible to regular people and not be so kind of art house, avant garde or dark that people could not access the show. So to be popular and well-regarded by fancy people is exciting because it means we’re threading a very fine needle.”\n\nHere, he tells Variety what’s in store for season three (which is now in production), his plan for the series finale, and who he’ll be rooting for on Emmy night.\n\nWhy do you think the show is resonating so much?\n\nI hate to break it down to a bare minimum. I think people really love the actors and I think they really love the way the actors inhabit the characters. So we don’t have, necessarily, plot lines that drive people to our television show. I think there’s a warmth to it and a tone to it and a melancholy optimism to it that obviously draws people in. But I really do think it’s these actors who are doing something that is very, very hard to do, which is they are super fun to look at while being incredibly talented actors while also being incredibly charming and funny and accessible. And so I think people turn on their television at 9:00 on Tuesday and see versions of their lives and their families and themselves. I think it’s the actors who seem to be getting it done for us.\n\nSeveral of your actors were nominated — including Sterling and Milo, as well as guest actors Ron Cephas Jones and Gerald McRaney. But Mandy Moore, Chrissy Metz and Justin Hartley were overlooked. How do you assess the situation with the acting races?\n\nI don’t understand how the whole thing works. It’s an interesting thing because when we set out to do this show, I almost never would have thought we would have been able to be allowed into this fancy conversation. But then once you’re there, you’re going, how can Mandy and Justin and Chrissy not be nominated for what they did this season? And you get sucked in a little bit. You go real quick from being grateful to being disappointed for the ones that you didn’t get. But I think our group is close enough that collectively we just feel that when any individual gets the nomination, they’re representing the larger whole. And we’re not just saying it like in a platitude kind of way. The show gets nominated. They won a SAG award last year against all these other fancy cable shows. That’s exciting stuff. So for us that’s the win. We’ve got 20 million people a week watching the show, the cast can’t walk down the street, and famous directors and writers are calling me about actors who they didn’t know a couple of years ago. And so it’s all really, really exciting.\n\nGiven the success of the show, are you surprised not to see more shows trying to copy your formula? Has broadcast learned anything from your success?\n\nI don’t think that’s how television in any form of writing or producing really works. Our show is very hard to do. It’s deceptively hard. And so, just because you’re trying to do something with emotion or multiple characters doesn’t mean it’s that simple. When we made this show, one of the things people would say was, “I liked the script but these shows don’t work. They don’t draw in mass audiences, they don’t get high ratings.” And we did it anyway. And so I’m a believer that when something hits, it can be good to go in the complete opposite direction because that’s why something hits, it fills a void. It’s different from what people have been getting fed. So my opinion is hit them where they are as opposed to just trying to do something. What would be nice is if this show’s popularity allowed people to live in this kind of dramedy space a little bit more. Not because they’re being copycats but because its success proved that there’s an appetite for it. That would be an exciting thing for me as a person who loves that s—, you know?\n\nWhen you look back over the course of the season, what moment are you proudest of?\n\nI have a few. We did an 11-minute family therapy scene in the middle of the season last year where the three siblings and Mandy as their matriarch were going back and forth at each other. Just watching the way our writers wrote that and that way the actors performed it I was like, ‘Wow, we’re really doing something here.’\n\nHow does that impact you going into season three? How did you avoid that sophomore slump?\n\nI’m surrounded by people who take this show and their job and their work very seriously and they’re very good at it. The world is cynical and the Internet has turned into this vicious cynical place. I know the show’s not going to dip in quality because we’re not going to allow it to happen. If you liked the show for two seasons, you’re going to like it now. We have nothing left to prove for ourselves now. Now we want to sit down and just make a bunch more great episodes of television and then get out while we’re on top and while we’re still feeling good before it all goes to s— and we’ve overstayed our welcome. We’re not gonna stick around forever. Our show has some scope and some size to it and we have a set story we set out to tell with an ending and we’re not going to stretch it just to make more money or continue more seasons with more ratings. It’s just not what we’re going to do on this one.\n\nDo you have that end game in mind?\n\nI do. In some ways we’ve shot some of it already. In my mind’s eye I know what that episode is and how many episodes we kind of roughly have before then and seasons. We know where we’re going and that’s why I’m not really worried about slumps. We know what our storylines are, we know what our arcs are, we know how we’re going to kill ourselves to execute. We go through a process here where a script gets written, whether it’s myself writing it or one of our writers, and we sit in a room and we beat it up and we criticize and then we rewrite and we work it and we work it and we work it and we do the same thing with our cuts and our edits and we don’t stop until we feel we’ve got something that we’re really, really proud of. And as long as we continue that process, I don’t see why we should take a step backwards.\n\nAre there things that you want to do with the third season that you haven’t gotten to do yet?\n\nI think the third season we’re going to be doing a lot of stuff that we haven’t gotten to do yet because you know, the end of our second season was a bit of a chapter closing and new chapters opening and that was the point of our throw forward into the future, but also why we ended at a wedding where the family is collectively taking a breath and saying they’re going to take a breath and try and move past these things they’ve been holding onto. And so what’s really exciting about the third season is we continue these same exact characters we know in their storylines, but there’s new chapters for everybody and so it’s not like starting over, but it’s like we’re embarking on some new plotlines for everybody that go to some issues that people are going to really attach to and have access points to and others will find that in other storylines. But there’s a lot of new stories coming everyone’s way, which is exciting for us.\n\nHow are you feeling about the third season?\n\nIt feels really strong. We’re doing some really ambitious stuff. Our first episode back is our past storyline which is basically the first date, the first night following their meeting that Jack and Rebecca ever have together. We’re really into early, early Jack and Rebecca incarnations, origin story, and then we’re doing stuff with Vietnam. I just wrote an early episode of the series. It’s a standalone Vietnam episode about Jack’s story, and I wrote it with Tim O’Brien who is our foremost author on Vietnam, so we’re doing really cool ambitious stuff. And then we also have really relatable human stories for Beth and Randall on fertility and Kate and Kevin, and so I’m really excited about what we’re doing. I’m as excited as I’ve been and more than our first two seasons.\n\nIt sounds like you’re going to deliver on all those promises of the flash forward in the season 2 finale.\n\nThe future storyline is not going to play a big part in the season, but it’s a framing device until we get the answers. We’re not going to bring it all the way to the end of the season. I think it will be answered much sooner than that, like the midway section.\n\nIs there a nomination other than your own that you’re excited about?\n\nJudd Apatow’s documentary on Garry Shandling was the best thing I’ve seen on a screen this year, I found it incredibly interesting and moving and smart. I found it profound and complicated and moving. I loved it. And anything with “Game of Thrones” is always like a win for me. The first year we got nominated for everything, “Game of Thrones” wasn’t eligible. And so to be able to go to the [awards show] this year along with “Game of Thrones,” it will be like being an eight-year-old boy and seeing like your favorite superhero dressed on Hollywood Boulevard for me. Like I don’t know what I’m going to do with myself when they’re all there together.",

So let’s get straight to that. Annnnnnd of course we have to replay the whole stupid scene again. Andy and Kyle seem to think this is hilarious. Andy just wants to be sure he gets the bunny for the clubhouse. If Kim was so afraid of the bad bunny energy in her house, why did she keep possession (pun intended) of the damn thing for weeks on end?\n\nRinna has one of the best props ever it’s a little blue box that you press like a remote and it says Fuck You! I need this in my life. Rinna says that Kim just wants to be on the show and she is her meal ticket. I have to say that when Kim was IN MY OPINION near death, I set a Google alert on her. It’s the only Google Alert I have. I used to cringe when they would come through because it was always something bad. For the last year or so, I only get one when she in on RHOBH and Rinna’s name is always on it too. Rinna has a lot of other publicity. Kim only has Rinna.\n\nDorit the idiot opens her mouth and I scream at her to shut up louder than Rinna did. Just shut the fuck up Dorit, this has nothing to do with you. Just shut the fuck up.\n\nAndy is going to need to change pants several times he is so orgasmic about all the verbal jabs flying back and forth. Then he joins in with an imaginary question harking back to Kyle saying in the limo at the end of season one that Maurice takes care of Kim like a second wife and she still treats them badly. The question was, “How is that not enabling?” Kyle is very thrown by the question. Kyle doesn’t really know what an enabler is. She thinks it is just about giving the addict alcohol.\n\nEileen sticks up for Rinna. Kim is overtalking everyone. All of these scenes where Kim is trotted out do not make her look sober. In my opinion.\n\nI think this is Round Four Xanax v. Coke. How the hell do I pick a side here? Can I have some of both? Dorit literally makes no sense when she tried to tell her side. Rinna says the Xanax story was in the press and she has kids. And then Kim says it’s in the press about me too and it hurts my kids. Yes Kim, multiple arrests, fleeing multiple rehabs under cover of darkness, disrupting your kids wedding and appearing to be unhinged in public all while not completing your court appointed sentence is exactly the same as Rinna joking about having a Xanax smoothie. It’s totally the same.\n\nAndy tries to wrap things up and hopefully get Kim off the stage, but Eileen interrupts and wants to know why Kim thinking being on a soap opera is an insult. Kim says that soap operas are more dramatic. Eileen asks Kim, “Have you seen yourself on TV?” Kim is the most overly dramatic person on any franchise and Eileen is frequently called boring because she is not dramatic at all in real life.\n\nIs Eileen only wearing one super long earring on purpose or did she lose one?\n\nLVP hasn’t said twenty words this entire reunion. Why should she when Dorit will say it all? She really had no storyline other than animals and kids. The found Max’s mother through a PI. Max says he wants to meet his birth mother to than her for giving him up. LVP is fine with it. It sort of sounds like LVP wants to have him communicate through an intermediary. A viewer tried to give LVP shit for giving Max his own place. If you listen closely to the recording you hear her say he still has to pay the mortgage on the place. I don’t have a problem with her doing that at all, if she can afford it. It’s also a good way to hide assets by selling the property at a loss to your child for tax purposes. Or putting it in a family trust. She also got grief for not consoling Ken when he was crying about dogs. LVP and Eileen seem good. Maybe not really good. But good.\n\nAndy ribs Rinna (SWIDT?) about posting a nude on Instagram. She says she loves the attention but the girls made her take it down. Harry didn’t know about it. We go right into another segment about Rinna. Because RINNA IS THE DAMN SHOW. Andy seems impressed that both her girls are high fashion models. Erika recently had dinner with Yolanda.\n\nEveryone loves Harry. And his meat. And his pies. Harry watches all the shows and often tells Rinna, “You just can’t help yourself, can you?”\n\nIt seems that with the exception of Rinna and Kim, and perhaps Rinna and Eden and also Rinna and Dorit … everyone gets along well enough.\n\nAndy takes the bunny for the clubhouse whether they want him to or not.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n",

'The saga played out in front of the tens of millions who follow the pair on social media.\n\nChyna’s lawyer has now said she may be preparing for a legal battle and is considering all options at her disposal.\n\n“We are considering all legal options and recourses at this time,” Chyna’s lawyer, Walter Mosley, told ABC.\n\nIn California, where Kardashian lives, revenge porn is a criminal offence and it is illegal to intentionally distribute \"the image of the intimate body part or parts of another identifiable person”.\n\nThe penalty is up to six months in prison and a $1,000 (£770) fine. A number of legal experts have said Kardashian may have potentially violated the state's revenge porn laws.\n\nLisa Bloom, the women's rights lawyer who represented Mischa Barton in her recent successful civil suit against an ex to prevent revenge-porn images of her from being released, weighed in on the furore on Twitter, saying: \"Note to Rob Kardashian: revenge porn is a crime. And in my Mischa Barton case judge agreed it's a form of domestic violence. Knock it off\".\n\nIn October 2013, the California Governor signed a bill outlawing so-called revenge porn and levying possible prison time for those who post naked photos of their ex-partners. In 2014, the first person was convicted and sentenced to a year in prison for violating the law.\n\nWatch Apple TV+ free for 7 days New subscribers only. £8.99/mo. after free trial.

Smalls \n source: www.thevisibilityproject.com/2014/07/11/remember-that-time-the-emmys-got-it-rightus-neither-we-fixedit/ \n text: Emmy Award nomination is always an interesting time of year. This year that is perhaps even more true as The Emmy’s made history when Laverne Cox became the first transgender* actor to receive an Emmy nomination (Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series) for her portrayal of Sophia Burset on the Netflix series Orange is the New Black. This is certainly cause for a celebration – we’re celebrating, celebrate with us.\n\nWe’re happy for Laverne Cox despite The ViP team (it’s unanimous) holding the unpopular opinion that Cox’s nomination is more political than earned. We’re here for it! Don’t get us wrong, we just also have to be honest. We don’t feel she beat out other potential candidates on OITNB for this category – not with screen time and not with her performance. You’ll also note that while we love, adore and admire (a couple of us are even obsessed with) Kerry Washington just the same – she didn’t make our list either.\n\nThose aren’t the only changes we made to this year’s Emmy’s nod list. Before we get into what should’ve happened let’s talk about what actually happened.\n\nOrange is the New Black dominated the comedy category and helped offer some color to a very white ballot. The binge-watch favorite earned 12 nominations in all, including a nomination for Best Comedy Series. Uzo Aduba (Suzanne “Crazy Eyes” Warren) and Natasha Lyonne (Nicky Nichols) joined Cox in the Outstanding Guest Actress category (the only category with more than one person of color in it), while Taylor Schilling (Piper Kerman) and Kate Mulgrew (Galina “Red” Reznikov) got nods in Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, respectively.\n\nIn the past few years, nominations have crept away from networks and toward cable television, which allows for gritty dramas, edgy comedies and a lower season episode count, which means overall less work for writers and production teams and some network folks aren’t happy about it. Netflix has recently joined cable as an outlet for intense storytelling. Between its critically acclaimed series Orange is the New Black and House of Cards, Netflix garnered a total of 31 nominations, impressive for a network only in its second year at the Emmy’s. Cable provider HBO led the networks with a whopping 99 nominations, including 19 for the top-nominated program Game of Thrones.\n\nEven critics’ staple favorites like CBS’s The Good Wife came away with fewer nominations than expected. While nods were secured for Best Actress category frequenter Julianna Margulies (Alicia Florrick), supporting actor Josh Charles (Will Gardner, whose on-screen death came as one of the biggest television shockers of the season), supporting actress Christine Baranski (Diane Lockhart) and guest actor Dylan Baker (cringe-worthy client Colin Sweeney), the program was noticeably missing from the Best Drama Series category. Also noticeably absent from the list was Fox’s new breakout hit, Sleepy Hollow.\n\nSome traditional network shows, however, managed to make the cut. Shonda Rhimes’ fast-paced fan favorite Scandal came away with a Best Actress nod for Kerry Washington’s Olivia Pope and guest actor nods for Joe Morton (Rowan “Papa” Pope) and Kate Burton (Sally Langston).\n\nWhile Canada hasn’t seemed to have much luck with the Emmy’s (Orphan Black’s Tatiana Maslany), British programs like Sherlock, Downton Abbey and Luther (Idris Elba’s Best Actor in a Miniseries nomination makes his fourth Emmy nod overall) have all made more than one appearance in this year’s Emmy nominations.\n\nTheater apparently also makes good television, as screen adaptations of the plays The Normal Heart and The Trip Bountiful earned Emmy nods. The Normal Heart, which aired on HBO, dominated the Best Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie category, with Jim Parsons, Joe Mantello, Alfred Molina and Matt Bomer taking up four of the six available spots. Mark Ruffalo and Julia Roberts earned nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. Cicely Tyson earned a Best Actress in a Miniseries or Movie nod for her work in The Trip Bountiful, impressive since the movie aired on Lifetime, which does not traditionally do well in the Emmy race.\n\nEmmy nominations often belong to a closed group (check the lists for best comedy and drama series’ actors for the past five years — the same names come up a lot). And so often the Emmy’s get it wrong. Actually we couldn’t remember the last time The Emmy’s got it right. So, The Visibility Project staff sat down, brainstormed and got to work on fixing the 2014 Emmy’s nomination list. We’ve done a little bit of category shifting in some places, based on quality of performance and the fact that British shows count as shows and not miniseries in our minds.\n\nAs our staff writer, Kylee pointed out during our decision-making process, #wethegods, we’ve fixed the list our way and how we see fit. We stuck to the main categories so we added an honorable mentions list of actors that would definitely make the cut if we’d fixed the full list.

Except cauliflower. F— cauliflower” he added, referring to the couple’s son Greyson 2.\n\nThe pair also made an video giving fans a look at their festive Halloween photoshoot.\n\n“Behind the scenes of the Matthew’s annual Halloween photoshoot,” Farley wrote on her own Instagram account, alongside a short clip of the video. Sherevealed that they decided on Moana-themed costumes because the Disney film is their son’s “favorite movie.”\n\nOver the weekend, the mother of two also shared a sweet — and spooky — video of her daughter showing off all of the festive decorations in their front yard.\n\n“@meilanimathews favorite time of the year 👻 just got home from Spain and we are putting in some werkkkkkk,” she wrote alongside the video.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Snooki on JWoww’s Split from Roger Mathews: “I Think They’re Gonna Be Fine”\n\nEarlier this month, Farley and Mathews celebrated their anniversary by having dinner together — and then taking a ride in a horse-drawn carriage.\n\n“Rome wasn’t built in a day,” Mathews wrote alongside a photo of the pair dining together.\n\nRELATED: Jersey Shore: Jenni ‘JWoww’ Farley Reveals She Almost Divorced Roger Once Before Finally Filing\n\nAfter nearly three years of marriage, Farley filed for divorce from Mathews on Sept. 12, according to New Jersey’s Asbury Park Press.\n\n“The Plaintiff and the Defendant have irreconcilable differences which have caused the breakdown of the marriage for a period of at least six months which make it appear that the marriage should be dissolved and that there is no prospect of reconciliation,” Farley’s complaint stated.\n\nHours after news of the divorce filing broke, Mathews shared an emotional video on social media, swearing that he was “not done fighting” for his marriage.",

She and Sanders issued a very public apology to Pattinson.\n\nWhen the Twilight series ended in 2012, Stewart and Pattinson seemed to go their separate ways both professionally and romantically.\n\nEach has earned critical praise and International awards consideration for leaving blockbuster fare behind and starring in smaller, indie films. Meanwhile, Stewart came out as bisexual and began seriously dating model Stella Maxwell in late 2016, while Pattinson became engaged to U.K. singer FKA Twigs.\n\nBut Pattinson’s engagement to Twigs reportedly ended in October, while the Daily Mail, citing a report in OK! magazine, said “there’s trouble in paradise,” with regards to Stewart and Maxwell’s relationship.\n\nIn April, the Twilight stars were reported to have “gotten together a few times over the past several weeks,” according to OK!\n\n“They’re trying to keep it low-key, but there’s still chemistry there,” a source told OK! “People in their circles are starting to wonder if they’re considering a reconciliation.”\n\nSupposedly, Stewart hopes Pattinson is “serious” about having forgiven her, an insider told OK!\n\nIf there is the possibility of a reconciliation, Twihards on Twitter can hardly contain their excitement:\n\nRobert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart were photographed together for the 1st time in 5 years and my inner Twihard is really showing pic.twitter.com/1x5myv9GLf — Linds (@Lindsertart19) June 3, 2018\n\n*new pictures of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart hanging out in LA 5 years after breaking up* pic.twitter.com/ymrOlkO1xV — katha 🌸 (@allkindsof_RK) June 5, 2018",

        "input": "time: 2013-05-21 \n author: Tricia Romano \n source: https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-real-bling-ring-where-are-they-now \n text: Sofia Coppola’s upcoming movie, Bling Ring, is based on a real group of teens and 20-something friends and acquaintances who began robbing the rich and famous in 2008. Over the course of the following year, they stole from Orlando Bloom, Audrina Patridge, Lindsay Lohan, Rachel Bilson, Brian Austin Green, and Megan Fox, and raided Paris Hilton’s house five (!) times (She helpfully left a key under the mat.)\n\nBefore they were busted, the group snagged $3 million in loot, including $2 million worth of jewelry from the Hilton fortune heiress, stole Rolex watches and Louis Vuitton luggage from Bloom, and essentially went shopping in Partridge’s designer-laden pad. All members of the crew have since seen their day in court. A few members of the real-life Bling Ring have had a more illustrious postscript than others.\n\nAlexis Neiers\n\nThough she wasn’t the ringleader or the brainchild behind the burgling posse, Neiers, by virtue of very bad/good timing, had already filmed a pilot for a reality show when she was busted, thus ensuring the E! program about her acting aspirations, Pretty Wild, would instead document the unfurling of her case in real time. In the Coppola film, a character based on her (named Nicki), is played by Emma Watson.\n\nSentence: Pled no contest to felony burglary charges involving actor Orlando Bloom’s house. Sentenced to 180 days in jail; served 30 days with three years probation and $600,000 restitution to Bloom.\n\nPostscript: The most public member of the Bling Ring, Neiers, now 21, documents her life on her blog and her Twitter account. While she’s currently living a happy life, it’s been a long road. She just gave birth to a baby girl, Harper, and is married to Evan Haines, whom she met while attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. But prior to that, she had been arrested for possession of black tar heroin, and was ordered to spend a year in residential rehab.\n\nSince cleaning up, she’s been vocal about her skepticism of Coppola’s movie. She wrote on her blog: “This obsession is what makes the Bling Ring so prevalent almost 5 years after the initial robbery took place and it is because, I believe, that a majority of society is just as sick as these teens were. We are obsessed, I believe because we want an inside look into the real life of these celebrities and we enjoy publicly scrutinizing people because they “sin” differently then we do. It is a method of distracting us from having to look at our own actions and sick behavioral patterns. The story of teens robing [sic] the homes of celebrities is artificial and has no real depth and substance and I can only hope that Ms. Coppola decides to shed light to this truth.”\n\nNick Prugo\n\nNick Prugo had apparently never watched an episode of Law & Order. If he had, he would know the golden rule of being interviewed by the police: ask for a lawyer and say nothing. But when the cops picked him up, a nervous and scared Prugo talked and talked and talked some more. Officer Brett Goodkin, the lead investigator, told Vanity Fair, “He confessed to crimes we didn’t even know he committed.” The former actor even went on the talk-show circuit, giving an interview to Good Morning America. And Prugo told Vanity Fair that one of the reasons they started robbing luxury vehicles was to fuel his then cocaine habit.\n\nSentence: Pleaded no contest to two counts of first-degree residential burglary involving break-ins at the homes of Lindsay Lohan and Audrina Patridge and sentenced to time served (365 days in jail).\n\nPostscript: Prugo was released from jail on April 15, just in time for the movie’s release. However, he seems to have learned his lesson about talking too much. When we reached him on Facebook, he amiably told us he couldn’t speak about the case at this time.\n\nJonathan Ajar, a.k.a. “Jonnie Dangerous”\n\nHe was depicted as the “fence”—or the person taxed with selling all the ill-gotten goods for cold, hard cash. But Ajar was technically not part of the D.A.’s official “Bling Ring” case and was charged separately. Then 27, he also had a prior record (including a conviction for attempting to sell cocaine), and had served 37 months in federal prison. Prior to getting busted, Dangerous promoted parties at trendy Hollywood hotspots like Les Deux, and lived large: selling, by his own admission, according to a Maxim magazine article, a pound of weed a week and moving coke, that is—when he wasn’t hanging with Playboy playmates and cruising around L.A. in a Lincoln Navigator. He dated another Bling Ringer, Courtney Leigh Ames, which is how he met the rest of the crew.\n\nSentence: Pleaded no contest to possession of cocaine for sale, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and one count of receiving stolen property from the Bling Ring haul. He was sentenced in 2010 to three years. He’s been out of the joint since March 2011.\n\nPostscript: According to his Instagram and Facebook feed, Ajar is still living large. His Instagram is filled with pictures of Louis Vuitton bling, stacks of cash, Chronic, and Cadillacs. Now a resident of Hawthorne, he’s been keeping busy: dining out on scrumptious meals at Mastro’s in Beverly Hills (hashtag: “livinglikerapperssaytheydo”); picking up a pair of Rolex watches from the jeweler; and partying late night with aspiring rapper Daimyo Johnson (caption: “Birthday party 4:20am got $60,000 racks in #don’tknowwhattimeitis Hahahahaha fucking partying…#rockstar”).\n\nWhen contacted by The Daily Beast on Facebook, Ajar wrote, “I know intimately everything that happened. If your main source is court docs and snitch statements, you have to understand most of that is not very credible. Also Det. Goodkin [Brett Goodkin] is under investigation now for multiple offenses, in regards to this case. Hopefully he will loose [sic] his job. He is the one that Sofia Coppola chose to be her source, honestly I laugh a little inside every time I here [sic] that.”\n\nHe ultimately declined to be interviewed.\n\nDiana Tamayo\n\nClass president at Indian Hills and voted by her high schoolmates as having the “Best Smile,” Tamayo didn’t have much smile about. She’d already been busted shoplifting with Rachel Lee, and would hang with Courtney Ames before joining in the Bling Ring’s fun. Her primary asset to the group was her size—she reportedly was small enough to crawl through dog doors to get inside the houses.\n\nSentence: Pled no contest to residential burglary for robbing Lohan. Sentenced to three years probation and 60 days of community service and time already served.\n\nPostscript: When reached by The Daily Beast via text on her cell phone, she wrote, “Hi, I have chosen not to talk to any media because I want that to be in my past. But I will say that my life has changed. I’ve found God and starting to get my career with fitness and nutrition going. Thank you, have a beautiful day.”\n\nRachel Jungeon Lee\n\nFingered by Prugo as the ringleader, Lee went to high school with Prugo at Indian Hills where she was voted “Best Dressed.” Subsequently portrayed in the media as the one who was most motivated to rob the houses, the daughter of two North Korean immigrants was painted by Prugo and the press as being obsessed with celebrity in general and reality stars in particular. Lee was reportedly enamored of the clothing and lifestyle of stars regularly seen on the In Touch Weekly magazine circuit. She had already had a prior history of theft—having been fined and put on probation when she and fellow future Bling Ringer Diane Tamayo were busted for shoplifting from Sephora. While the others were panicked during the robberies, Lee was depicted by Prugo as being cool, calm, and collected, and indicated that she even cherry-picked some art to decorate her apartment. (During one of the robberies, it was reported that she was so at ease that she took time to defecate in a bathroom belonging to one victim.) She was living in Las Vegas when the ring was broken up. A character based on Lee is played by Katie Chang in the movie.\n\nSentence: Plead no contest and sentenced to four years in state prison—the longest sentence of all—for robbing Patridge’s home. Served two years and was paroled on March 28, 2013.\n\nPostscript: Whereabouts unknown. In 2011, Wendy Feldman, the prison coach for Lee, told FOX411’s Pop Tarts column, “It has been a stressful two years waiting for her day in court, but Rachel has gotten lots of therapy, she’s gotten clean and sober and become much closer to her mom. She has taken full responsibility for her actions. Her attitude is that she is very much ready to go to prison and face the consequences.”\n\nCourtney Leigh Ames\n\nThe former girlfriend of Ajar, Ames was also friends with Roy Lopez, the other alleged “fence,” and buddies with Lee. During the trial, Ames grabbed headlines for her “duh” moment—wearing a necklace that apparently belonged to Lindsay Lohan to court, nabbing her another charge.\n\nSentence: Pled no contest to receiving a jacket stolen from Paris Hilton. Sentenced to three years probation and 60 days of community service. Like Tamayo and Lopez Jr., Ames got a light sentence when it was discovered that Brett Goodkin, an investigator in the case, had allegedly consulted on Coppola’s movie without getting clearance from his superiors. According to the Los Angeles Times, the judge said in court, “You should all write a thank-you letter to Goodkin, because his judgment is as poor as it gets. You can have a field day with his credibility during trial ... It’s a shame what he did. It’s harmful to the people’s case.”\n\nPostscript: Whereabouts unknown.\n\nRoy Lopez, Jr.\n\nRoped in by Courtney Ames with whom he worked at a restaurant in Calabasas, Lopez is the one who grabbed the most loot—a cool $2 million of Paris Hilton’s jewelry (all later returned). But when he couldn’t sell it, the group turned to Ajar, who supposedly had better connections.\n\nSentence: Pled no contest to receiving stolen property. Sentenced to three years probation and was given credit for the 100 days he had already served in jail.\n\nPostscript: Whereabouts unknown.",

Janet Jackson is a mom to a one-year-old baby son, Eissa, and while he was with his father and her estranged ex-husband Wissam Al Mana on Saturday night at the Nobu hotel in Malibu, she reportedly called the police from to check on the welfare of her little boy.\n\n“Deputies were there [and] called to the scene. They decided the child was okay and they left,” a Malibu Lost Hill’s Sheriff’s Station spokesperson told People.\n\nEntertainment Tonight also spoke to Janet’s brother Randy Jackson who revealed the pop star decided to call 9-1-1 after the nanny (who was helping Wissam babysit) called her worried about Wissam’s aggressive behavior. “[She was] terrified by his behavior and locked herself in a bathroom, so she could contact Janet,” he told the news outlet.\n\nJanet and Wissam previously married in 2012 and split in April 2017, just three months after Eissa was born in January 2017. “I just want to keep it real for you guys for a second — yes I separated from my husband. We are in court and the rest is in God’s hands,” Janet told her concerned fans at the time. It was subsequently reported that Janet felt like a “prisoner” in her own marriage. “She thought he had become too controlling during the pregnancy and she had already allowed him to dictate her appearance and even the way she performed at concerts,” a source told Page Six.\n\nNow, Janet is allegedly dating her ex-boyfriend Jermaine Dupri, whom she previously dated from 2002 until 2009. “Janet’s taking it slowly, but yes, she and Jermaine are dating,” an insider recently In Touch. “She’s comfortable with him. They know everything about each other, and she’s happier than ever.” We’re just glad Eissa is okay!",

After the news broke Wednesday morning, Variety published a report with three women claiming the anchor had sexually harassed them, as well. One woman claimed the anchor gave her a sex toy as a present, along with an explicit note on how he would like to use it on her, while another claimed he exposed himself to her inside of his office. The latter also claimed that he had a button underneath his desk that could lock the door from the inside.\n\nNBC's Seth Meyers was one of the few stars of late-night TV that didn't address the media bombshell, but he tweeted an explanation why.\n\n\"Due to the tree lighting we taped tonight's show yesterday so if you're wondering why any of today's news is conspicuously absent this evening - now you know!\" Meyers wrote.\n\nMany of the late-night hosts also seemed pretty disturbed by other tweets on the subject from President Donald Trump.\n\nWow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for “inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.” But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack's past! @realDonaldTrump\n\nSo now that Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the “unsolved mystery” that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate! @realDonaldTrump\n\n\"Listen up! You don't get to comment,\" Colbert said.\n\nSee what else Colbert had to say on the situation, along with Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon.\n\n\"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\"\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to 'The Late Show.' I'm your host Stephen Colbert. I am one of the few men still allowed on television,\" the CBS star said to kick off his monologue.\n\nThe late-night host suggested that America really shouldn't be surprised by these allegations since Lauer had a history of dressing as women every Halloween. The former morning show host has dressed up as Dolly Parton, a \"Baywatch\" girl, Paris Hilton, Jennifer Lopez and Lucy from \"Peanuts,\" to name a few.\n\nBut as Colbert pointed out, the initial allegation and subsequent termination was just the tip of the iceberg; it was allegations in the Variety article that he really found disturbing.\n\n\"It's bad enough that he gave her a sex toy, but he also gave her instructions? He found a way to mansplain sexual harassment,\" Colbert said. \"I'm going to say what that woman honestly could not at the moment, 'What a dick.'\"\n\nAs for Trump tweeting about the \"Fake News practitioners at NBC\" in his reaction to Lauer's termiantion, Colbert said: \"By fake news do you mean more than a dozen women accusing Trump of improper conduct or sexual assault? Is that what you mean by 'fake news?' Listen up! You don't get to comment; that is the pot calling the kettle at 3 AM asking what she's wearing.\"\n\n\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"\n\nKimmel found out about the allegations when his wife looked at her phone Wednesday morning and said, \"Oh my God, Matt Lauer.\"\n\n\"Which of course I assumed he was dead so I guess this is better, I don't know,\" Kimmel said.\n\nWhile the ABC late-night host found the situation \"surprising,\" he was more angered by Trump's response on Twitter.\n\n\"I'll tell ya if anyone knows about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace at NBC, it's Donald J. Trump,\" Kimmel said. \"Is he aware that he's him? I don't think he is.\"\n\n\"As far as Matt Lauer goes, what happens next? Does he have to do an emotional sit down interview with himself?\" Kimmel joked.\n\n\"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\"\n\nThe NBC late-night host found a way to inject some holiday spirit into the Lauer scandal.\n\n\"The Rockefeller Christmas tree was lit tonight,\" Fallon said. \"Also getting lit tonight, the HR rep over at the 'Today' show.\"\n\n\"If you're wondering where in the world is Matt Lauer, he's probably at a bar somewhere with Charlie Rose,\" the late-night host added.\n\nLike the rest of the late-night gang, Fallon also called out Trump's tweets.\n\n\"Actually President Trump tweeted about Matt Lauer being fired and went on to attack NBC News executives and Joe Scarborough. And then Kim Jong-Un was like, 'Uh, did you guys not see that missile yesterday or I mean, I know you're busy, but I can relaunch it or something. Are you kidding me here?'\"",

I’m an idiot.” Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Rabbi Shmuley Boteach released the emotional podcast interview, Barr’s first since ABC canceled the revival of the show “Roseanne.” Boteach, a longtime spiritual adviser for Barr, asked her why she would write something that was in such “complete contravention” of her Jewish values.\n\n“I’m a lot of things, a loudmouth and all that stuff,” Barr said, sobbing. “But I’m not stupid, for God’s sake. I never would have wittingly called any black person . . . a monkey. I just wouldn’t do that. I didn’t do that. And people think that I did that, and it just kills me.”\n\nBarr reiterated her explanation that she was medicated with the sleep drug Ambien when she posted the tweet comparing Valerie Jarrett, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, to an ape. The tweet in late May read: “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarr told Boteach that she did not know Jarrett was black, an assertion she has also made publicly.\n\n“When ABC called me and said, ‘What is the reason for your egregious racism?’ I said, ‘Oh my God, it is a form of racism,’ ” Barr said. “I guess I didn’t know she was black, and I’ll cop to it, but I thought she was white.”\n\nRoseanne Barr has a history of making racist remarks and of fanning the flames of conspiracy theories. ABC canceled her show for it on May 29. (Video: JM Rieger/The Washington Post)\n\n“But you still regret and don’t excuse what you wrote,” asked Boteach, who said he has been friends with Barr for two decades.\n\n“Of course, no, I don’t excuse it. I horribly regret it. Are you kidding? I lost everything, and I regretted it before I lost everything,” Barr responded. “And I said to God: ‘I am willing to accept whatever consequences this brings because I know I’ve done wrong. I’m willing to accept what the consequences are.’ ”\n\nBarr added that many refuse to accept her apology. “I’ve made myself a hate magnet,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Barr’s tweet about Jarrett, ABC shut down the “Roseanne” revival, which Barr had starred in. When Barr blamed the tweet on Ambien, the company that produces the drug responded that “racism is not a known side effect” of any of its medications.\n\nLast week, three weeks after ABC abruptly canceled the show, the network said it had ordered a spinoff centered on the same family, but without Barr. The working title is “The Conners.”\n\nShare this article Share\n\nBoteach, whom The Washington Post once called “America’s most famous rabbi,” has been a spiritual guide for the likes of Michael Jackson and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J). In releasing the podcast interview Sunday, he praised Barr for her “incredibly public and passionate commitment to Judaism.”\n\nAfter Barr’s Twitter rant, Boteach said he “reached out to her and told her that she has a responsibility, in the name of repentance and her commitment to Judaism, to make this right.” In the interview, he asked her to affirm that she believes in the Torah values that “every human being is created equally in the image of God.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBreaking down in tears, Barr spoke of her intense remorse: “After your heart is unfrozen and after it stops being broken from the pain you caused others, you stop being a robot and you’ve got to come back to God.”\n\nBarr said what she did makes her “sick.” “I can’t defend it. I don’t want to defend it,” she said. The actress said she had been trying to call Jarrett to apologize to her personally.\n\n“I caused a lot of pain. I know that, and that’s the worst feeling in the world,” she said. “I caused pain for my family, I caused pain for my mother, I caused pain to the 200 out-of-work actors that I loved, and the crew and writers. I feel so bad that they gave me another chance and I blew it.”\n\n“But I did it,” she added. “And what can I do now except for say . . . I’m not a racist, I’m an idiot. And I might have done something that comes across as bigoted and ignorant, and I know that that’s how it came across. And you know, I just ask for forgiveness because I do love all people, I really do.”\n\nHere’s the interview:",

After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”\n\nBryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”\n\nMariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all? Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don’t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!\n\nThis alleged engagement would be the third time Mariah walked down the aisle, as she was previously married to Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37. After dealing with a pair of heartbreakers, MiMi isn’t fooling around, especially when it comes to her $520 million fortune. She’s working on an ironclad prenup, according to OK! magazine. “She’s had tow failed marriages already,” the source says. “She’s not going to take any risks here.” Speaking of Nick, expect to see him during Mariah’s big day.\n\nNick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added.

They explained they have \"neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever\" in the production of the season, before adding that it \"should only be considered as a work of fiction.\"[58] Executive producer Ryan Murphy answered that the series was \"not a work of fiction\" as it is based on a non-fiction book, Maureen Orth's Vulgar Favors, and that the production team and FX stand by the author and her work. Comparing it to The People v. O. J. Simpson, Murphy added that the season is \"a work of non-fiction obviously with docudrama elements,\" and not a documentary.[58] Following this answer, the Versace family released a second statement, still slamming the series as \"a work of fiction\" because \"the Orth book itself is full of gossip and speculation.\" They also heavily criticized Orth's work, calling it an \"effort to create a sensational story\" with \"second-hand hearsay that is full of contradictions.\" They gave the example of Gianni Versace's medical condition, as Orth claims that Versace was HIV positive at the time of his death.[59]\n\nAntonio D'Amico also criticized the series, deeming some scenes as \"ridiculous\" and insisting that \"so much has been fictionalized\". He also revealed that he does not plan to watch it, but that he would have been happy if Ricky Martin, who plays his role, got in contact to get some insight into his relationship with Versace.[60]\n\nAccording to Ryan Murphy, Donatella Versace was very supportive that Penélope Cruz played her role. As Cruz and Versace are friends, Murphy explained that, when he offered her the role, Cruz asked the permission of Versace before agreeing to do it. He also revealed that, while Cruz was representing the series at the 75th Golden Globe Awards, Versace \"very graciously sent [her] a lovely and huge flower arrangement saying 'good luck.'\"[58]\n\nRatings [ edit ]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ [6] This episode was available five days before the official premiere for FX+ subscribers.",

Although the star’s life has been filled with different milestones, perhaps the most notable is the birth of her baby boy DJ Isaiah.\n\nEver since she won American Idol at the age of just 17, Jordin’s career has taken off.\n\nBut after years of nonstop working, becoming a mom and taking a break may be what she needed.\n\nSparks now has a very beautiful and happy family alongside her son and husband Dana Isaiah, and she always makes sure to share some of the most memorable moments of her life with her many fans as well.\n\nThe two were introduced by some mutual friends, and the connection was immediate.\n\nAfter her failed relationships with Jason Derulo and then Sage the Gemini, she had pretty much given up on love.\n\n‘I had gone through a crazy time last year, so I was just like ‘You know that? I’m good. I am going to stay single. I am just not going to look.’ It is amazing that that phrase, ‘When you don’t look for it, that’s when it comes,’’ she shared with People.\n\nThe in love pair eloped in July of 2017 in Hawaii, and just weeks after their wedding, they learned that they were pregnant!\n\nOn Father’s Day, Sparks paid tribute to her man, and it was very sweet: ‘I knew the moment that I met you that my life was going to change. And it really has in the most beautiful way. Thank you for being the most amazing man I know. For bringing me much light and joy. For making me a Mommy. For constantly building me up and making me better. For loving me and loving DJ.’\n\nThe singer is definitely enjoying motherhood, and she was ready for it even before the birth: ‘The joy, laughter, scrapes, and bruises…I can’t wait for it all!’\n\nHowever, when it comes to giving her son a sibling, let’s just say it’s not going to happen anytime soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n‘No, no. I’m not ready. Nope. I would love for him to grow [up with siblings] because we had siblings. But ask me in like three years,’ she previously told ET.",

How would making guacamole help with his life?\" Corden replied, referencing Porowski's not-so-secret love of avocados.\n\nClad in a hoodie and an ill-fitting T-shirt and pants, Young first met with Berk about transforming his sad outdoor space at work. \"We like succulents. I collect them,\" Young told Berk, 36, of his aesthetic. \"I have them at my house. I pick them when I go for a walk.\"\n\nWhile Corden lamented that plant picking sounds \"depressing,\" Berk easily decided on an Arabian Nights theme for the drab space.\n\nFrance was up next and opted to throw away Young's entire wardrobe after hearing that the guitarist was striving \"to look like James Bond.\" Instead, Young looked like 007 \"sort of going through an emotional break down,\" as Corden put it.\n\nThen it was Porowski's turn to talk healthy eating and he suggested a quick snack consisting of a banana with peanut butter, cinnamon, honey, and Chia seeds. Next up was Brown, 37, who schooled Young and Corden on how to do sit-ups and squats.\n\nThe real transformation came from Van Ness, 35, who took Young's scraggly beard and wild hair — which Corden thought made Young look \"a hipster version of Donald Trump's doctor\" — and tamed it into a Bachelorette-contestant-worthy swoop.\n\nThe final reveal took place on the twinkle light, succulent-filled pillow fort that Berk designed. With a stylish brown jacket, a gray henley top and black pants and loafers, Young said his wife would think he was a \"handsome devil\" following his makeover.\n\nThe Fab Five recently sat down with ET's Courtney Tezeno to dish about season two. \"We have women. We have amazing women. We have an amazing trans man we get to work with,\" Van Ness said of the people whom the Fab Five help out during the show's upcoming season.\n\n\"And you get to know us a little more as well,\" France, 35, added. \"It takes a deeper dive into who we all are also.\"\n\n\"You get to see our little quirks as well,\" Porowski chimed in. \"It's fun.\"\n\nHere's more on Queer Eye's upcoming second season:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

She was thrilled to share the news with those closest to her, but it would be weeks before she confirmed anything to her adoring public—and she has kept mum about the father to everyone.",

Now, her friends and family are worried about her well-being.\n\nOn Saturday, \"Glee\" actress Naya Rivera was arrested after a police deputy responded to a call made by her own husband, fellow actor Ryan Dorsey claiming his wife was \"out of control\" and that she had started getting physical. A video of her lashing out at Dorsey was eventually given as evidence to the authorities along with the actor's own minor facial injuries. Now, a source close to the actress has revealed that her family and friends have become increasingly worried about her.\n\n\"Naya's friends and family are very concerned for her well-being,\" the source told E! News. \"This is not the first time that their relationship has been violent, and the fact that she hit her husband and lashed out like that, is very scary to everyone around her,\" the source added.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\nAnother video of the actress in handcuffs while being arraigned had surfaced online. On Tuesday, Ryan Dorsey finally spoke out regarding the difficult situation his family is currently in.\n\n\"This is a difficult time for everyone in the family especially for Naya and I. This isn't some reality show, this is our life, and I ask that everyone especially 'the media' please respect our privacy and treat us/this situation how you would want a loved one to be treated,\" the 34-year-old actor said via Twitter.\n\nShortly after her arrest, the actress was released on bond and her father-in-law had been there to pick her up. Interestingly, Rivera's father-in-law had also been present when the altercation had occurred, but according to reports, he hadn't fallen victim to Rivera's violent outbursts. The incident occurred while the couple was out taking their 2-year-old son, Josey, for a walk.\n\nJust a month ago, the actress filed a request to dismiss her divorce from Ryan Dorsey, and the two were reportedly working on their relationship after separating for a couple of months.",

He was 91.\n\nLewis died at his home in Las Vegas at about 9:15 a.m. Sunday morning, his agent confirmed.\n\nFor most of his career, Lewis was a complicated and sometimes polarizing figure. An undeniable comedic genius, he pursued a singular vision and commanded a rare amount of creative control over his work with Paramount Pictures and other studios. His legacy also includes more than $2.5 billion raised for the Muscular Dystrophy Association through the annual Labor Day telethon that he made an end-of-summer ritual for decades until he was relieved of the hosting job in 2011.\n\nBut Lewis’ brand of humor did not always wear well as times and attitudes changed. Over the last 10 years of his life, his reputation soured slightly as he was forced to apologize for making a gay slur on camera during the 2007 telethon, continued to make racist and misogynistic jokes, and didn’t hesitate to share his right-wing political views.\n\nIn addition to his most famous films, Lewis also appeared in a number of notable works, such as Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy,” but was largely offscreen from the late ’60s on and was more active with his telethon and philanthropic efforts. As late as 2016, Lewis continued to perform in Las Vegas, where he first debuted his comedy routine back in 1949.\n\nThe high regard in which his comic abilities were held in France — he received the Legion of Honor award in 1983 — became a running joke in the U.S. long after Lewis’ style of broad physical comedy fell out of fashion. His final film, “Max Rose,” screened at France’s Cannes Film Festival in 2013.\n\nThe telethon, like other aspects of Lewis’ life, was beset by controversy. The comic’s offstage persona was anything but humorous. He was, by his own admission, an impatient man, and over the years battled numerous illnesses and a prescription drug dependency. His parting with Martin in 1956 after 10 years as a duo was acrimonious. And the telethons were awash in claims that there was a disparity between the money pledged and the money collected.\n\nLewis’ pairing with Martin, featuring their improvisatory backbiting and physical chicanery, was an instant hit in 1946. When producer Hal Wallis saw them performing at the Copacabana and at Slapsie Maxie’s in Hollywood, he saw the potential for a new Bob Hope and Bing Crosby and signed them to a Paramount Pictures contract.\n\nFor the next 10 years, Martin and Lewis turned out one silly film after the next starting with “My Friend Irma” in 1949 and including “The Caddy,” “The Stooge,” “Artists and Models” and “Pardners.” None of their films grossed less than $5 million, a handy sum in those days.\n\nThe premises of the films grew tired, and the more Martin and Lewis worked together, the more disparate they appeared. In 1956, after their film “Hollywood or Bust,” they made their last dual appearance at the Copacabana.\n\nBy the time of their breakup, Martin had a prosperous career as a recording artist and actor. And soon Lewis, too, was a hot solo ticket.\n\nShortly after they broke up, Lewis filled in for an ailing Judy Garland in Las Vegas. Over the next five years Lewis developed a slicker, more sophisticated stage persona and would continue to play Vegas until 2016.\n\nOnscreen he made a go of it in such films as “The Delicate Delinquent” and “Rock-a-Bye Baby.” Lewis even had a million-selling single in the “Rock-a-Bye Your Baby” title track, which led to several albums on Decca Records.\n\nHe then extended his efforts into writing, producing and directing films, signing what was then a mammoth $10 million deal with Paramount. The first two, 1961’s “The Ladies Man” and 1962’s “The Errand Boy,” showed him at his best. His talents also dovetailed with director Frank Tashlin’s style in films such as “Cinderfella” and “The Disorderly Orderly.”\n\n“The Nutty Professor” (1963) was his biggest success ever, grossing $19 million. But by then his mugging and exaggerated body gyrations had become out of control, as had the syrupy moments in his films.\n\nLewis signed a nonexclusive deal with Columbia that resulted in several uninspired films such as “Three on a Couch,” “The Big Mouth” and “Don’t Raise the Bridge, Lower the River.” Even Lewis had to admit, “Jerry Lewis is never just OK or adequate; he’s either very funny or he’s awful.”\n\nWhile Americans largely dismissed him, Lewis had developed a following at French film journals Cahiers du Cinema and Positif.\n\nHe was born Joseph Levitch in Newark, N.J. Both his parents were in show business and, at the age of 5, Lewis made his debut at a Borscht Belt hotel singing “Brother Can You Spare a Dime?”\n\nPerhaps because his parents spent a great deal of time on the road, Lewis was demanding attention through humor by the time he was attending Irvington High School in New Jersey. By age 15 he was pantomiming operatic and popular songs and was booked into a burlesque house in Buffalo.\n\nIn 1942 he tried out his comic pantomiming at Brown’s Hotel in upstate New York, where he was also working the summer as a bellboy. Comic Irving Kaye was sufficiently impressed to land Lewis some bookings and became his road manager.\n\nLewis met the young singer Dean Martin at New York nightclub the Glass Hatt and was first paired with him in 1946. Afters years of rupture, Martin made a surprise appearance on the Muscular Dystrophy Telethon in 1976, a reunion orchestrated by their mutual friend Frank Sinatra. The pair also reconciled after the death of Martin’s son in the late 1980s. Martin died in 1995.\n\nIn the early ’70s he continued to direct uninspired fare such as “Which Way to the Front?” and then tried a serious film, “The Day the Clown Cried,” though he famously shelved the completed work (some footage of it finally surfaced in 2013). He attempted a live TV variety show that failed, as did an attempt at a Broadway musical, “Feeling No Pain”; it was followed by the acrimonious “Hellzapoppin,” which was ditched out of town in Boston at a loss of $1.25 million.\n\nIn 1972 he lent his name to a string of 200 movie theaters for Network Cinema Corp., which led to bankruptcy proceedings in 1974. His heavy schedule also brought him to the verge of a nervous breakdown, serious ulcer problems and painkiller drug dependency. In 1982 he had double-bypass heart surgery and gave up his four pack-a-day smoking habit.\n\nLewis was offscreen until 1979’s low-budget “Hardly Working,” which he also directed; it did not reverse his fortunes. But in 1982, director Martin Scorsese harnessed the brash, cynical side of Lewis’ persona for the role of a kidnapped latenight talkshow host in “The King of Comedy.” Though he reportedly resented being upstaged by Robert De Niro and Sandra Bernhard, the film represented some of Lewis’ finest work. Another high point was a similarly caustic appearance as a lethal underworld figure on the TV series “Wiseguy.”\n\nMost of his later film work, however, failed to impress, such as “Slapstick of Another Kind,” “Cookie” and 1992’s “American Dreamer.”\n\nIn 1995, he appeared in Peter Chelsom’s film “Funny Bones” and took over the role of the devil in a Broadway revival of “Damn Yankees,” which he took on tour in the U.S.; he then appeared in a London production of the musical.\n\nIn 2003 he provided a guest voice on an episode of “The Simpsons”; in 2006 he did an episode of “Law and Order: SVU” in which he played the insane, morally befuddled but bizarrely benevolent uncle of Det. John Munch (Richard Belzer).\n\nLewis long sought to create a sequel to “The Nutty Professor”; eventually, Imagine Entertainment produced and Universal released the 1996 remake starring Eddie Murphy on which Lewis was credited for the screenplay to the 1963 version and as an executive producer.\n\nLewis also hoped to bring a musical adaptation of “The Nutty Professor” to Broadway. By summer 2012 an ailing but still enthusiastic Lewis made his stage helming debut with such a musical, with a score by Marvin Hamlisch and a book and lyrics by Rupert Holmes, in Nashville, where it played for seven weeks.\n\nIn 2013 Lewis starred in the long-gestating project “Max Rose,” written and directed by Daniel Noah and also starring Claire Bloom, Kevin Pollak, Kerry Bishe and Mort Sahl. Lewis played a jazz pianist who recently became a widower.\n\nIn 2009, Lewis received the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences’ Jean Hersholt Award for his charitable work. In May 2014, he added his footprints to those of other screen luminaries at the Chinese Theatre.\n\nIn 1944 Lewis married former band singer Patti Palmer, with whom he had six sons, Gary, Ronnie, Scott, Anthony, Christopher and Joseph, who died in 2009. Gary for a time had a rock career as the lead singer of Gary Lewis & the Playboys. The marriage ended in divorce.\n\nHe is survived by his second wife, SanDee Pitnick, with whom he adopted a daughter.",

During her pregnancy, the makeup mogul insisted she would raise her child on her own without ANY nannies, but since the baby’s birth, Kylie has found herself in over her head. As a result, she’s hired a significant amount of help — cue the I-told-you-so’s! But hey, at least the 20-year-old can admit when she’s wrong, right? Click here to see adorable pics of baby Stormi.\n\n“Kylie had every intention of raising Stormi without nannies but it didn’t take very long for her to admit that she needs help,” a source close to Kylie shared with HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “She went three nights in a row without really sleeping. After that she broke down and hired night nurses.” Once Kylie got a taste of what that was like, she apparently couldn’t resist asking for even more assistance. “That was such a big help she very quickly started hiring more staff for her and Stormi,” our insider explained. “Her mom is still helping her but she’s got her own life, she’s not giving that up.”\n\nOf course Kylie’s opinionated family is rubbing her nose in it a little bit, after all, she was SO convinced she could take care of Stormi all on her own. “Kylie had to eat a little humble pie when she agreed to hire nannies because she made such a big deal about how she wasn’t going to do it,” the source added. “She definitely said some things that were a little offensive to her sisters about them using nannies, they’re giving her a hard time about it now.”\n\nAt first, Kylie said she only wanted family members around her child, but once Stormi arrived, she realized that wasn’t very realistic. With the extra set of hands, it seems Kylie and her baby daddy, Travis Scott, 25, are handling parenting well. In fact, the two are on better terms than ever now, as Travis recently gave Kylie a lavish $1.4 million push present! He gifted her with a rare Ferrari, and she’s completely in love with it.\n\n“It really proves to her that Travis loves her because this gift was just so perfect for her,” our insider told us. “It put the nail in the coffin for her and Tyga, that’s for sure. She hasn’t talked abut him once since Travis gave her this car. She’s all about Travis again.”",

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n\nBig Little Lies is officially returning for a second season this weekend on HBO. Here’s everything we know so far. Fair warning—spoilers ahead, if you haven't finished season 1. (What are you waiting for? .)\n\nSeason 2 will premiere on June 9.\n\n“It’s looking like June. I think June,” Kidman told Andy Cohen during CNN's New Year's Eve special, when he asked about the season's debut.\n\nAnd in February, HBO confirmed that news with an Instagram post:\n\nIn a new trailer released in April, announced the official date of the premiere. Big Little Lies will return on June 9.\n\nIt had been previously reported that new episodes would air sometime in 2019. \"It wouldn't be impossible to get on in 2018,\" HBO's president of programming, Casey Bloys, said.\n\nNeed a quick recap before diving back in to the story?\n\nFortunately, HBO just posted everything you need to know if one quick Instagram video. Watch it here:\n\nNicole Kidman just dropped a huge spoiler for season 2.\n\nDuring a panel at the Wing previewing season 2, Kidman revealed that despite his character seemingly having died in the first season of Big Little Lies (sorry for the spoiler!), Alexander Skarsgard is returning in some capacity for season 2.\n\n\"He was the most incredible acting partner, and then he came back for season 2…\" Kidman said before trying to back-peddle a bit. \"He has a little bit of a part in the sense of … the basis of … okay, I’ll be quiet. He didn’t abandon us. We’ll put it that way.\"\n\nTVline previously reported that Skarsgard was \"expected to return in some capacity.\" HBO also previously confirmed that viewers will see \"most\" of the main characters again in season two.\n\nGiven Kidman's comment, we'll likely see Skarsgard play his character, the abusive rapist Perry, in flashbacks, but speculate wildly with us for a moment.\n\nMaybe he'll come back to haunt the women of Monterey. Or, perhaps, Big Little Lies season two will add a convenient time-travel element, à la Outlander.\n\nOr maybe he isn't dead after all. As Skarsgard said at the Golden Globes, “I don’t even know if I’m really dead or not. I feel okay right now but we’ll see.\"\n\nHe told Digital Spy that he has \"read all the scripts\" for season two. And that it's \"very smart\" and \"very good.\"\n\nHe has also shared that he was on-set during filming, but can't disclose what he was doing there.\n\n\"I was on set, yes. I can’t disclose what I did on set,” Skarsgard said on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. \"Maybe, I was acting. I might have been just moral support. I might have just made coffee for the ladies. I might have helped Meryl Streep with her acting… Not help, but just give her little pointers, fine tune it a bit.”\n\nWatch the full interview below:\n\nThe first full trailer is finally here.\n\nThe clip shows a new costume party (one that appears to be '70s-themed), the Monterey five in a police line-up, a preview of Meryl Streep's role, and of course, Madeleine and Renata making their presence known at school.\n\nA new Instagram handle for the series just revealed photos from the season.\n\nFollow along at @biglittlelies.\n\nAll the women of Monterey are coming back.\n\nIn February of 2018, HBO confirmed that Shailene Woodley, Laura Dern, and Zoe Kravitz had signed new contracts for season two.\n\nPreviously, HBO had announced that Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman will return as both stars and executive producers of the series.\n\n\"I’m thrilled to be bringing back this talented team of artists,\" Witherspoon said in a statement. \"It gives us the opportunity to delve deeper into the lives of these intriguing and intricate Monterey families and bring more of their stories back to the audience who embraced and championed them.”\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Witherspoon and Kidman will each receive a significant salary bump, and will make \"around $1 million an episode\" for season two. Co-stars Kravitz, Dern, and Woodley will reportedly get raises as well.\n\nDeadline also reports that Kathryn Newton (who plays Abigail), Robin Weigert (who plays Celeste's therapist, Dr. Amanda Reisman), Merrin Dungey (who plays Detective Adrienne Quinlan), and Sarah Sokolovic (who plays Tori Bachman) will all be returning as well.\n\n\n\nMeryl Streep will play Perry Wright's mother in this season.\n\nHBO confirmed on Twitter that the legendary Meryl Streep has been cast in Big Little Lies season two, joining the \"tribe of fierce #BigLittleLies women.\"\n\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter. Streep's character arrives in Monterey searching for answers after Perry's apparent death at the end of season one.\n\n\"She deeply loved her son … as much as any mother can love her son,\" Big Little Lies author Liane Moriarty told The Daily Telegraph about the role. \"She had a slightly fraught relationship with her daughter-in-law, so it’s a very complicated, difficult time.\"\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, stars of the show are thrilled that Streep is joining the cast.\n\n\"We didn't think we'd get her,\" Kidman told ET during a show at New York Fashion Week. \"It really is her standing up and going, 'I support you as women, and I believe in you,\" Kidman said. “I think that's a big statement from her.\"\n\n\n\nKidman's co-star Laura Dern agrees. \"It's amazing! When I tell anyone in my life that Meryl Streep is joining us, it's incredible!\"\n\nThere will be some other new faces in the cast.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Alienist star Douglas Smith will play Corey Brockfield, \"an off-beat surfer, aspiring marine biologist and Jane's (Shailene Woodley) co-worker.\"\n\nThe publication also reports that Crystal Fox and Mo McRae have joined the cast in the roles of Elizabeth Howard and Michael Perkins, respectfully, and that actor Denis O’Hare will play Ira Farber.\n\nThe Night Of star Poorna Jagannathan, too, will be in season 2. According to Deadline, she will play a new character called Katie Richmond. At this point, it's unclear how she'll fit into the storyline.\n\nNicole Kidman also recently told Ellen that her kids appear in this season as extras. Listen to that conversation here:\n\nZoe Kravitz promises there will be \"a lot more of Bonnie in season two.\"\n\n\n\n\"There is a lot more of Bonnie in season two,\" the actress said in an interview with Refinery 29. \"It's kind of interesting the way it worked out. If there had only been one season, it would have been a bit of a bummer. It's interesting to have saved that for the second season, especially seeing what happens at the end of season one. Now [we're] revealing who she is, why she is the way she is, and why she did what she did. I don't think you will be disappointed.\"\n\nShe also told Rolling Stone, \"They’re not using her to tell someone else’s story ... She has her own story.\"\n\nShailene Woodley also says this season is going to be 'very emotional.'\n\n\"My character has a very different story line which is wonderful, but for many other people it goes deep,\" she told The Hollywood Reporter. \"It's going to be very emotional but at the same time still be comedic and have those light moments, but it doesn't shy away from the dirty,\" she said.\n\nFilming has wrapped on season two.\n\nNicole Kidman posted a sweet Instagram to mark the occasion.\n\n\"That’s a wrap on #BigLittleLies Season 2 filming! What a beautiful journey this has been with my Monterey 5 sisters and our passionate dedicated crew,\" she wrote. \"Thank you HBO for the amazing opportunity and thank you Andrea Arnold for being our fearless leader, and of course the one and only Meryl Streep for believing in us. I love you all. xx\"\n\n\n\nAnd Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern quickly followed suit.\n\nThe cast have been posting photos from set all summer long. Here are a few of our favorites.\n\nIn mid-August, Reese Witherspoon shared an adorable video from on-set with her body double, Marilee. Watch the clip below:\n\nHere's the first picture of Meryl Streep on set:\n\nAnd here's an amazing picture of Reese chucking an ice cream cone at Meryl while filming:\n\nPhotos of the whole incident surfaced on Twitter, where user @mattybooz wrote, \"I am praying Reese pelts Meryl with that ice cream. #BigLittleLies.\" Witherspoon wrote back, \"Oh Matt! No need to pray. I got her !\"\n\nStars Laura Dern, Zoë Kravitz, and Shailene Woodley have also all shared Instagrams from set. See more behind-the-scenes photos here.\n\nSeason two will have a female director.\n\nAndrea Arnold will direct all seven episodes of the new season. \"We have an incredible new director who's British, Andrea Arnold, and it's really been a great experience to watch how she's taken what we all created in season one,\" Shailene Woodley said. \"She has implemented her own creative vision, while maintaining the same tone and emotions, and that’s been such a delight and so lovely to work with.\"\n\nReese Witherspoon also praised Arnold. “I’m beyond excited to be working with talented and acclaimed director Andrea Arnold who will be at the helm,\" she said. “Andrea’s unique storytelling style will be a welcome addition to the filmmaking team.\"\n\nIt will continue where season one left off.\n\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, \"Season two will explore the malignancy of lies, the durability of friendships, the fragility of marriage and, of course, the vicious ferocity of sound parenting. Relationships will fray, loyalties will erode … the potential for emotional and bodily injury shall loom.\"\n\nSome people are still hesitant about continuing the story.\n\nWhile the network is obviously keen to continue the success of a program that was both a fan favorite and an award-winner, there's a vocal group that believes season one of the show told the story of these troubled California women perfectly—continuing the series would only sully what made it so great in the first place.\n\nIn an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, writer David E. Kelley reveals that he initially thought a season two wasn't a great idea. \"We wrote it as a one-off and we ended it in a way that was very lyrical. But we ended on a lie. I get so protective of characters and series, too, that I don't want to damage them in any way, and I so loved how we ended year one and I thought, 'Let's just leave it at that,' he reveals.\n\nBut then he was convinced by the character Meryl Streep is playing that a second season could work.\n\n\"Liane [Moriarty, author of the novel Big Little Lies] wrote a novella of [new] stories, and most of them we're using,\" he shared. But the genius one was introducing this character who's being played by Meryl Streep. It's a delicious character and I felt bringing her in was both liberating and daunting. \"\n\nHere's how to watch Big Little Lies:\n\n\n\nSeason one is available to stream or buy on a number of sites, including HBO, Hulu, Amazon Video, and iTunes.

Capshaw tweeted to Jane The Virgin creator Jennie Urman in March, praising her work on that show, and Urman responded asking if she could write something for Capshaw next. \"From camp BFF's to comedy wranglers on television,\" Capshaw replied. \"YES PLEASE!\"\n\nSo, she's apparently open to new possibilities, and Capshaw's fans are eagerly awaiting whatever that next endeavor will be. \"I hope she finds something that makes her as happy and sunshine-y as [Grey's Anatomy] made her,\" Reddit user cattagatta wrote.\n\nTwitter is similarly buzzing with people calling for Arizona spinoffs and Capshaw leading roles.\n\nCapshaw hasn't really made a habit of juggling Grey's Anatomy with any other projects — she only has two other TV credits since joining the Grey's cast in 2009. But now that her schedule is less consumed by Grey's, she'll have time to take a look at what else the industry has to offer.\n\nShe's also got four children and a husband, whom she frequently features on her Instagram accounts, and she's proven that she's accustomed to having a lot on her plate. \"A lot of people, especially who are working moms, say it’s all about balance and trying to create a balance, and I respectfully disagree. I don’t know that any part of my day is ever balanced,\" Capshaw told Yahoo late last year. \"I don’t spend equal parts being mom or being a worker, being a wife, being an advocate, being a humanitarian, whatever it is that I am endeavoring to be.\"\n\nAs she mentioned, Capshaw is definitely an advocate — she's always sharing causes that are important to her, like ending gun violence and achieving pay equity. No matter where she goes from here, something tells me she'll be busy with something. And regardless of where her career goes, it's clear that her role as Arizona will always stay with her.\n\n\"I never would have imagined that I would be able to play a character that would feel like it does so much good, whether it’s people who feel like the character resonates with them and it makes their day a little easier to see themselves represented,\" she said in the same Yahoo interview. \"Or if it’s someone watching it who has someone in their life who is gay and they might have not understood it before and all of a sudden, they have another person or another thing to point to and say, ‘Oh that’s a different context.’ Being able to play a lesbian as a series regular on television has been enormously rewarding.\"\n\nThere's no denying Arizona has been a hugely inspiring figure on Grey's — she's wowed viewers with her passion for the tiny humans she's healed over the years, she remained resilient in the face of unimaginable hardship, and she was always a friend to those around her. The loss of both her and April will be hard, but it's far from the last we'll see of the actors behind them.",

Check back throughout the day for exclusive content straight from the actress herself. Go to InStyle.com/oliviamunnday. Here, Munn tells us the secrets to her flawless style, on and off the red carpet, plus she shares photos of when she felt her best!\n\nOn the HBO show The Newsroom, Olivia Munn's character wears mostly dark colors, classic silhouettes, and minimal jewelry, but in the real world the actress prefers to dress differently. \"For me, for my life, I love to play around more with accessories and dresses and prints and colors,\" Munn says.\n\n\"She's not afraid to try new things which is what I love about working with her,\" says Micaela Erlanger, Munn's stylist. \"She looks great in anything. She has this gorgeous, dewy skin tone and honestly because of that, she can wear a ton of colors that are tricky.\"\n\nMunn is all about comfort, whether it's on the red carpet or during her downtime on the weekends. \"Weekends are the time when I get to actually dress up in my own kind of way,\" the actress says. Her go-to outfit used to be a cable knit crewneck Ralph Lauren sweater paired with jeans, and although she just stocked up on her favorite paper-thin cashmere sweaters from the label, this fall she's also going to experiment a bit more. \"I got these amazing Céline boots and I think this fall I'm going to do tights and knee-high socks and do that layered look on the bottom with a cute, short dress--and pile on some jackets,\" Munn tells InStyle.\n\nPHOTOS: Olivia Munn's Changing Looks\n\nDespite her love for experimentation, the actress admits that she didn't get in to fashion until about two years ago--and now she's hooked. \"It's so much more fun to care about dressing up and have fun with it when you're feeling good about yourself—you love the clothes, you're happy with your hair and makeup and you've been making those training sessions... which for me can all be a crapshoot,\" she says.\n\nBeing multi-ethnic (her mom is Chinese, her dad is German/Irish), finding a makeup artist who knows how to work with her face was a challenge. \"Highlighter between my eyes will make me look cross-eyed and I have no idea why,\" Munn says. And because of her height and curves (she's 5'4\") it was also difficult to find a stylist who knew how to accentuate the right spots and not over-accentuate the others. \"If you look at most pictures, my smile betrays my comfort level every time. If I look in the mirror before an event and I don't feel like myself, there's no way I can pretend I feel comfortable when there are dozens of cameras pointed at me. I usually have this look on my face that says 'Ugh, I feel stupid' and that's definitely not chic.\" Munn adds that she loves working with Erlanger because if she doesn't feel comfortable in something they move on, but at the same time she encourages the actress to try new trends or amazing pieces. \"She knows what suits her,\" the stylist says.\n\nKnowing what suits her includes knowing her figure, which Erlanger notes the actress loves to embrace and show off. \"We like to have fun. She can carry so many different looks. She has fabulous legs. She can rock a pair of shorts,\" she says. \"She's a chameleon in a way because she can carry so many different looks. I think ultimately she's elegant and feminine and sexy. Probably more sultry, I would say.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Olivia Munn Comments On Her Favorite Looks of All Time\n\nOlivia Munn is InStyle.com's guest editor today.

We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why she might have to bail on the festivities this year.\n\nBlake Shelton, 41, and Gwen Stefani, 48, have always made holidays together a big priority in their relationship. In 2016 they spent Thanksgiving at his Oklahoma ranch and rang in Christmas at her LA home. They were hoping to do turkey day at his country pad again, but she might have to skip out on the festive meal. “Gwen had the best time with Blake and his family last year at Thanksgiving and she would love to do it all over again. Last year she promised that she’d be back again for this Thanksgiving, but she might have to break her promise. She’s got so much work on her plate all month, it’s going to be very hard for Gwen to pull it all off,” a source close to the singer tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n“It’s crunch time for promoting her Christmas album, she’s got so many interviews lined up she’s even doing a meet and greet in LA on Black Friday. She keeps insisting that she can do it all, that she can have the big traditional feast with Blake and his family on Thanksgiving and then race back to LA for work,” our insider continues. Gwen just dropped her first ever holiday album You Make It Feel Like Christmas, on Oct. 6 and as the season draws closer, she’s going to be everywhere in support of it.\n\nSince the Blakester is the BEST BOYFRIEND EVER, he’s agreed to change up his Thanksgiving plans in Oklahoma if she can’t make it there to spend it with him. “Blake absolutely wants her there with his family, but he’s told her if she needs to stay in LA he’ll be with her. Either way they’re going to be together, but Gwen’s goal is to be superwoman and make it all happen. She doesn’t want to miss out,” our source says. See Blake and Gwen’s relationship milestones in pics, here.\n\nBlake played a big part in Gwen deciding to record a Christmas album, as the idea came to her while going for a run on her boyfriend’s ranch. “What if I did write a Christmas song? What would it be?” she told Billboard magazine. She said that within minutes she came up with a melody and lyrics that she laid down in a voice video as soon as she got back to his house. A few weeks later, she recorded her first ever holiday tune “Christmas Eve.” The title track is a duet between Blake and Gwen that we’re sure will be a total holiday classic for years to come.\n\nHollywoodLifers, have you listened to Gwen’s Christmas album yet? Did it get you in the holiday spirit?",

But lucky for us, the 41-year-old Oscar winner (and former model) doesn’t settle for something less than spectacular.\n\n“Charlize’s style is sexy and sophisticated,” says stylist Leslie Fremar, who has been dressing the actress since she starred in 2008’s Hancock. “She doesn’t really follow the trends but, instead, she makes choices based on her body and what she feels comfortable in. And since she doesn't go for anything too elaborate, the clothes never really take over. She wears the looks— they don’t wear her.”\n\nOver the years, Theron has developed a fashion formula that always seems to land her on the best-dressed list. Her trademarks? Clean silhouettes, a modern neutral palette with a touch of embellishment, and lots of plunging necklines, which her stylist says is a fave. “She’s tall and lean with broad shoulders, so deep-Vs are great on her because they bring the eye down,” adds Fremar.\n\nGetting ready for Cannes 🕶 A photo posted by Lesliefremar (@lesliefremar) on May 5, 2016 at 1:39pm PDT\n\nAlso on Theron's must-wear list? Lots and lots of Dior. “She obviously has such a great relationship with the brand being the face of the J’Adore fragrance,” says Fremar. “Beyond that, it’s a beautiful, elegant brand and she is a beautiful, elegant person. It just makes sense.

It felt like the show could see into the future, because the reference was just so timely. And now, they’ve done it again — except that this time they’ve had to edit the reference out.\n\nThe episode set to air tonight, titled “The 20s,” revolves around a flashback to Halloween of years past. The official synopsis reads: Trick-or-treating with the 10 year olds goes awry for Jack and Rebecca; and Randall, Kevin and Kate have life-changing Halloweens. The episode — which was made available to press ahead of time, and yes, I have watched it — takes us back to a Halloween when the Big Three were 10, and also 18 years later in the year 2008, when they’re all 28.\n\nIt’s in this 2008 flashback where we see Kevin struggling as an actor in Los Angeles. During the episode, Kevin’s roommate at the time comes home from a day auditioning and excitedly shares that he’s just booked a role on an upcoming Kevin Spacey movie.\n\nOut of all the actors This Is Us could have picked, they had to go with Kevin Spacey. Back in 2008, the actor had just wrapped a role as Lex Luthor in Superman Returns and was about to star in HBO’s Recount, which earned him an Emmy and Golden Globe nomination. So talking about Spacey being an actor everyone wanted to collaborate with isn’t such a far off idea — but 2008 seems like an eon ago.\n\nAnd now, following allegations that Spacey made sexual advances toward Anthony Rapp when Rapp was a minor (Spacey was 26, Rapp was 14), his prestigious star power has started to fall. TV Line was the first to report this Spacey edit; only one mention was made of Spacey, and it wasn’t a big plot point of the episode. NBC and 20th Century Fox (the production companies behind the series) issued a statement to press who received the episode early, explaining:\n\n\"In light of recent events, the producers have decided to remove the brief reference to Kevin Spacey.\"",

Baz Luhrmann had chosen three actors. It was Ewan [McGregor], it was Heath, and me,” he recalled. “We auditioned with many different actresses, it was a long process. But I never met Heath, I only heard about him. We would be shuffled in and out of rooms. They would literally put me in a room and lock the door and Heath would come in and then Heath would be shuffled through the door. I never saw him.”\n\nRelated: Celebrity Deaths: Stars We’ve Lost See all the celebrities that died in 2007, including Chris Cornell, Erin Moran and Greg Allman — read more\n\nMcGregor was cast for the role, but the failure brought the Oscar-nominated pair together and helped them form a lasting friendship. They eventually ended up working together in 2005’s Brokeback Mountain. “When Ewan was cast, I finally met Heath and we sort of became friends before Brokeback Mountain based on our mutual frustration,” Gyllenhaal revealed. “When Brokeback Mountain came out and it got all the attention it did, I remember, a few months later, Heath called me and he was like, ‘Hey mate, I got some news for you’. I said, ‘What?’”\n\nRelated: Celebrity BFFs Check out photos of Hollywood's hottest famous pals\n\nThe Southpaw actor continued: “He said, ‘Baz just offered me his next movie. I just wanted you to know, I f–king turned it down!’ So that was how much Heath loved me, you know. That was how I met him.”\n\nOn January 22, 2008, Ledger was found dead in his New York City apartment. The Dark Knight actor dated his other Brokeback Mountain costar Michelle Williams — whom he met on the set of the film — but they split in August 2007.

        "input": "time: 2017-07-24 \n author: Condé Nast \n source: https://www.glamour.com/story/girls-trip-grapefruit-sex-scene \n text: Google Girls Trip right now, and you'll see two major—and extremely different—results: First, and most importantly, are the headlines about the film's success at the box office and what that means for more films led by women of color in Hollywood (all good things, hopefully). The second? The Grapefruit Method, an oral sex technique demonstrated (hilariously) by Tiffany Haddish—without question the breakout star of Girls Trip.\n\nThe Grapefruit Method isn't a new term or something invented by the film–it was actually first popularized back in 2014 by viral tutorial videos from Auntie Angel of Angel's Erotic Solutions. (You can see that here.) But in a scene-stealing moment of the film, Haddish's character, Dina, demonstrates for her friends the oral sex act while using a grapefruit and a banana as props. Since then, the scene has launched many discussions about whether it's for real.\n\nThe directions, according to Dina, are simple: Cut off the top and bottom of a room-temperature grapefruit, then cut a hole in the middle of it. Place the grapefruit on your partner's member, and then...well, twist.\n\nYou can see a portion of it in the clip below:\n\n\"Grapefruiting is an act of love,\" Haddish explained to Entertainment Weekly in an interview. \"Make it mystical and magical.\" It certainly had an effect on-set: Jada Pinkett Smith told EW that Haddish started receiving love letters from the crew after filming. \"That’s true,\" Haddish confirmed. \"Somebody bought me something from Jared jewelry. All the guys started coming to my comedy shows.\"\n\nAnd Auntie Angel herself thinks the movie got it right, with one exception: \"Use a condom,\" she told TooFab. \"There are chances that citrus can get into his urethra, and he can have a bad experience—and, of course, they proved that in the movie.\"",

And the night belonged to Bruno Mars.\n\nHeading into the awards, Mars and Jay-Z led the nominations. But Mars ultimately swept the three biggest honors of the night, taking home Album of the Year and Record of the Year for 24k Magic and winning Song of the Year for “That’s What I Like.”\n\nRelated 3 reasons why the 2018 Grammys fell so flat\n\nMars won six Grammys overall. In the end, Jay-Z was completely shut out and went home empty handed.\n\nThe Grammys handed out more than 80 golden gramophones in total, including in dozens of categories whose winners were announced shortly before the live telecast. Going into the ceremony, for example, Mars had already won three Grammys: Best R&B Album for 24K Magic and Best R&B Performance and Best R&B Song for “That’s What I Like.”\n\nAnother big winner from the preshow awards was Kendrick Lamar, who won five Grammys total: He was honored with Best Rap Song, Best Rap Performance, and Best Music Video for “HUMBLE” during the preshow, and during the main ceremony, he won Best Rap/Sung Performance for “Loyalty” with Rihanna and Best Rap Album for DAMN.\n\nRelated The 9 best performances of the 2018 Grammys\n\nMeanwhile, other notable — and controversial — wins from the live ceremony included Alessia Cara for Best New Artist (in an unfortunate snub of SZA) and Ed Sheeran for Best Pop Solo Performance, with his song “Shape of You” (Sheeran somehow beat Kelly Clarkson, Lady Gaga, Kesha, and Pink, and he wasn’t even present to accept the award).\n\nBelow is a full list of the night’s winners in the Grammys’ televised categories.

Would she call the divorce off, too? We’ve learned EXCLUSIVELY that there’s one reason that Angelina would welcome Brad back with open arms.\n\nHope may not be lost after all for Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt‘s marriage. While they are firmly split and on their way to an official divorce, a source close to the couple tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Angelina changing her mind could still be a possibility! She and Brad, and their family, have been through so much after breaking up nearly one year ago. But there’s still love there, and it’s up to Brad to make her feel it again!\n\n“Angelina definitely has regrets about splitting from Brad and about the end of their marriage. At the time of the breakup things were really bad between them — they had been fighting a lot — and she felt that Brad had checked out of their relationship,” a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Obviously, there was a lot of drama surrounding the split, and bad feelings on both sides. Angelina misses Brad a lot more than she ever thought she would. She feels really lonely without him. Brad was Angelina’s best friend, as well as her husband. They talked about everything and totally had each other’s back. Angelina is a really stubborn person, and there’s no way she would admit to having made a mistake, but if Brad came crawling back to her and begged for another chance, she would willingly drop the divorce.”\n\nCould it happen? Could we really see the rise and fall, and rise of Brangelina again in our lifetime? Angelina’s already made it clear that she’s pleased with the progress Brad’s made in his sobriety. But Brad allegedly isn’t too thrilled with the prospect of making up, according to a report from Life & Style. And on their wedding anniversary, August 23, they gave each other the silent treatment, we learned EXCLUSIVELY. They didn’t want to ruminate on the sad day.\n\nHollywoodLife.com has reached out to Angelina’s rep for comment.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Angelina and Brad could make it work?

Last week CBS announced the exit of Ryan Kadro, the show’s top executive who had worked there since its 2012 launch, leaving an uncertain future.\n\n“Today” is hardly problem-free – remember Megyn Kelly? – but it has the steadiest audience of all three network morning shows. The elevation of Hoda Kotb into Lauer’s role is widely perceived as a winner.\n\nRose lost his job in November 2017 following allegations of improper behavior with women who had worked with him. Lauer’s downfall, also due to reports of inappropriate relationships with women, came less than two weeks later.\n\nThe NBC show currently averages 4 million viewers a morning, a 3 percent drop from 2017 before Lauer’s exit, the Nielsen company said. CBS has lost 10 percent of its audience in the same period, to just under 3.2 million. ABC’s “Good Morning America,” the first-place broadcast with 4.1 million viewers, lost 5 percent of its audience.\n\nThe long history of “Today” likely helps it absorb hits. The show launched in 1952 and while it has had missteps – it has never recovered the dominance it enjoyed prior to the ham-fisted departure of Ann Curry a decade ago – “Today” viewers can be confident it will be around tomorrow.\n\nMore: A year after Lauer firing, ex-reporter calls out NBC; Comcast says she's wrong\n\n“It just has the strongest DNA out of all the morning shows,” said Shelley Ross, who produced rivals at ABC and CBS.\n\nFor much of the past half-century, CBS has been an after-thought in the mornings, a distant third-place broadcast that changed names, formats and personalities as often as an impatient designer changes paint. That’s what made “CBS This Morning” so encouraging; with a newsy emphasis, it gained a larger share of the audience in the morning and was now competitive in a lucrative marketplace.\n\nRose, a skillful interviewer who moonlighted on both “60 Minutes” and his own PBS show, teamed with Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell.\n\nIn retrospect, Rose seemed more important to the success and chemistry of his show at the time than Lauer did. Rose was replaced by former “Face the Nation” host John Dickerson and, in October, Bianna Golodryga was added as a fourth anchor.\n\nLauer spent two decades as “Today” co-host, and in his heyday with Katie Couric was part of the most successful anchor team in morning show history. But his reputation took a significant hit with the Curry drama and he wasn’t as popular at the end of his run.\n\n“There was concern when Matt Lauer left that they would be hurt more than turned out to be the case,” said Garth Tiedje, an analyst and senior vice president at Horizon Media.\n\nIn fact, Kotb earned the permanent job beside Savannah Guthrie after “Today” did unexpectedly well in the ratings when she was an emergency fill-in. Kotb’s “Q” score, a statistical measure of her popularity, is strong among women – who make up the bulk of morning news show audiences – and more than doubles Lauer’s last score among older women, according to Marketing Evaluations, Inc.\n\n“Everybody loves Hoda,” Ross said. “She’s a magical part of the equation.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean everything is sunshine and flowers at “Today,” which has to be concerned about an erosion of younger women viewers. In the second week of December, its audience among 18-to-49-year-old viewers was down 23 percent compared to the same week in 2017, Nielsen said. It faces questions about its third hour following Kelly’s departure, and the fourth after Kathie Lee Gifford said she was leaving the show. NBC declined to comment.\n\nThe “Today” show executive producer, Libby Leist, was appointed to her job in January.\n\nFor all morning shows, the fact that more people wake up with a hand-held computer on their nightstands in addition to a television remote is ultimately a bigger concern than anchors who have lost their jobs.\n\nIn the days following Kadro’s departure, CBS dealt with damaging news stories suggesting that King was unhappy and considering leaving, and that networks were mulling a top-to-bottom renovation. The network declined comment on the reports or ratings, but said its newsy emphasis remains intact now and for the future.\n\nThe danger in responding to ratings weakness with big changes is that it could play into a narrative of CBS being less able than its rivals of being able to settle on one type of morning show for the long term.\n\n“It’s always hard to fight against the pull of history if it’s a long trajectory,” Tiedje said. “But I also think that shouldn’t cloud the decisions that need to be made for the future.”",

Sporting minimal make up and her signature messy bun, Meghan looked set for summer in a pretty floral frock teamed with a white fascinator, thought to be just £29.50 from Marks and Spencer, and a small mirrored clutch bag. However, the floaty maxi dress has received mixed reviews from online royal watchers, with some even likening the frock to a baggy pair of curtains and a table cloth.

She keeps her purses spotless and cleans them out every single night. The model is lactose intolerant so she avoids dairy - but she craves “mac and cheese, every single day of my life.” Although she is a style icon in her own right, Graham considers Kim Kardashian West her fashion icon. If she had to choose one product to never live without, she would choose rose water. Graham’s modelling icon is supermodel Cindy Crawford, whose Revlon campaigns she had taped to her wall when she was younger Of all the countries, Graham would most like to visit India. Her and her husband Justin Ervin met at a New York City church in 2009, where Graham was volunteering. Graham considers panty lines her biggest pet peeve. When asked what item every woman should have in her closet, Graham told Vogue a “bra, duh.” The best fashion advice she’s ever been given is “beauty comes in all shapes and sizes, rock your confidence.” The supermodel is into conspiracy theories revolving around the existence of mermaids and aliens - and loves watching YouTube videos about them Although she has walked in many runway shows, Graham thinks the hardest part is “staying focused and not looking at the audience” - a struggle when the audience is full of impressive people. Graham is confident and believes she can pull of anything - in response to a question about one look she cannot pull off, she said: “Curvy girls can pull off any look, it is what we do.” If she had to choose a spirit animal, she would pick a bird. Her advice for young women is to “love the skin you are in and be your own role model.” Although her career keeps her extremely busy, the model made time to binge-watch the Netflix series Stranger Things. If she could choose one show to get a reboot, it would be Sister, Sister. Her husband of eight years calls her “butt,” - a nickname she doesn’t think it is necessary for her to explain. Graham’s favourite lipstick is a nude colour from Charlotte Tilbury called Pillowtalk. She prefers SUVs over sedans, a preference she made clear as she got into a chauffeured car to New York Fashion Week. Finally, the one question she wishes people would stop asking her is “What do you think of the term plus-size?” Instead of the term plus-size, the body-positivity advocate prefers to use “curvy.”\n\nSince becoming a supermodel in 2016, Graham has defied odds and carved a name for herself in the fashion industry.\n\nGraham shared 73 things about herself in an interview (Vogue)\n\nOverall, Graham’s illustrious career in modelling has made her a role model and an inspiration.",

Louis was the name of Prince Phillip’s grandfather, Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg, as well as Prince Charles’ great-uncle Earl Louis Mountbatten, who was assassinated by the IRA in 1979. Louis is also a middle name for both Prince William and Prince George.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their newborn son.

Arthur of course also brings to mind King Arthur (though experts say there’s no evidence of any actual historical king behind the famous Arthurian legends).\n\nPrince Louis shares his third name, Charles, with his grandfather, Prince Charles.\n\nLouis Arthur Charles is the third child for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who welcomed a son, Prince George, in 2013 and a daughter, Princess Charlotte, in 2015.\n\nAhead of Louis Arthur Charles’s birth, the couple announced via the official Kensington Palace Twitter account that Middleton was expecting in September 2017, but opted not to reveal the baby’s gender (something they had done with their previous two children) ahead of the birth.\n\nThe baby’s birth is just one of a series of exciting life events for the royal family this spring, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be getting married next month on May 19th.",

In a video obtained by TMZ, Spears engaged the crowd, initially unaware that a man had climbed onto the stage, attempting to get her attention. Quick-thinking dancers encircled the crasher until security agents arrived onstage and surrounded the headliner.\n\n“Is something OK?” Spears asked. “What’s going on? What’s wrong?” Then — visibly frightened — she gasped, “He’s got a gun?” Her mic was switched off as she was rushed to safety offstage. Loyal fans voiced their support, chanting, “We love you!”\n\n(Warning: The video above contains graphic language.)\n\nThe man (who did not have a gun) struggled with security, even kicking a member of the force as he executed a cartwheel. Muscular members of her dance squad gathered to subdue the man until more security guards arrived, at which point the intruder was restrained and escorted offstage to chants of “A–hole! from the crowd. Before he was ejected from the theater, the man succeeded in kneeing one of the guards.\n\nLas Vegas law enforcement officials told PEOPLE that the intruder was 37-year-old Jess Webb, who apparently had been acting disorderly during the performance. After allegedly being asked to leave, Webb leapt to the stage. He was arrested for trespassing after the incident.\n\n“On Aug. 9, 2017, officers from the LVMPD arrested 37-year-old Jesse Webb for trespassing during a Britney Spears concert. Webb was asked to leave the concert by security prior to him jumping on stage and dancing,” the statement read. “Webb was transported to the Clark County Detention Center.”\n\nJust before the show, Spears had tweeted a warm message to her Vegas audience.\n\nFeels so good to be back in Vegas!! #PieceOfMe returns tonight! 🦋 — Britney Spears (@britneyspears) August 9, 2017\n\nShe’s scheduled to return to the stage on Friday.

Many noted how far-right and white supremacists still remain on the platform while voices like McGowan’s find themselves silenced.\n\nIn the meantime, my friend @rosemcgowan had her account suspended for calling out Harvey Weinstein for being a sexual predator. https://t.co/zjIty7ynnv — Shaun King (@ShaunKing) October 12, 2017\n\nAfter hours of silence, Twitter has finally issued a response. According to a tweet, Twitter suspended the account because she posted a “private phone number.” The company added that it is now in touch with McGowan.\n\nHere are the tweets:\n\nWe have been in touch with Ms. McGowan’s team. We want to explain that her account was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number, which violates our Terms of Service. 1/3 — Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 12, 2017\n\nThe Tweet was removed and her account has been unlocked.

This unique short season of the show includes a cast of famous athletes from different disciplines.\n\n\n\nThe season has a few winter Olympians such as Tonya Harding, Jamie Anderson, Mirai Nagasu, Chris Mazdzer and of course, Rippon. There are also some team sports players like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and former MLB outfielder Johnny Damon.\n\n\n\nIn this first week, the couples dance to the foxtrot, salsa, cha-cha-cha, or the waltz. The couples were evaluated both by the judges and from a live voting audience at home. For the first time in the show, two couples were eliminated on the opening episode. (Spoilers ahead!)\n\n\n\nLuckily, Rippon wasn’t one of the two couples. In fact, he was one of the top couples of the week. It’s been a dream for the Olympian to be on the show, so I’m sure it feels great that he performed well.\n\n\n\nBefore we get into the dance, we have to talk about his introduction video. The first 10 seconds of the clip where Adam meets his partner, Jenna Johnson, is just them screaming and hugging. \"It was destiny,\" he says.\n\n\n\n“Adam and I, when we first met, I was amazed because I felt like we had known each other for years,” Jenna explained in the clip. “Immediately, there was just a connection and a chemistry.”\n\n\n\nI need to get a drink of water before we discuss how amazing his freaking performance was. If I hadn’t seen him plastered all over Twitter for like a month, I wouldn’t have been able to tell which one was the celebrity and which one was the professional dancer. First off all, they danced to “Sissy That Walk.” I don’t know if that was Jenna’s choice or a production decision, but either way, genius move.\n\n",

For a long time it was the big reality show buttock,\" he said of how his clients' demands have shifted over time.\n\n\"Now we have discovered in the international plastic surgery community that buttock augmentation with fat is turning out to be extraordinarily dangerous. In fact it's the most dangerous procedure you could have with a really significant morbidity and fatality rate,\" he continued. \"Thank god, not many people are going for the big butt these days.\"\n\nWhile he didn't name names, he also applauded those in Hollywood for opting for more natural-looking enhancements. \"The fluffy face syndrome they were doing with the fat injections in the face, that's gone away,\" he explained. \"The overfilled face, the overfilled buttocks, the giant breast implants. Celebrities, in my opinion, have really got it together plastic surgery wise right now.\"\n\nWhile good plastic surgery is on the rise, there's still plenty of bad work for them to try and improve upon. Though Dubrow thought many would view their show as a \"cautionary tale,\" leading to less plastic surgery in general, he said \"it's gone the other way.\"\n\nIn fact, some of the complications they saw this season were unlike anything they've ever seen before.\n\n\"This one patient with a bad breast complication went to her plastic surgeon and he said, 'Look if you go home and puncture your implants, the implant company will give you a refund on your implants so your surgery would be cheaper,'\" explained Terry. \"So, she goes home and starts stabbing her chest with needles.\"\n\nSeriously.\n\n\"I just saw the patient, the one who, she tried this homeopathic remedy for skin cancer, this black salve to put on her nose, it actually destroyed her tissue, she had a big hole in her nose,\" added Paul.\n\nFor Nassif, that procedure is actually the one of which he's most proud. \"I just saw her the other day and seeing this new person, seeing this new personality, seeing this smile on her face ... that, to me, is one of the best things I've seen so far from this season,\" he added.\n\nDubrow was especially happy to help a bikini model whose butt was \"destroyed\" from illegal silicone injections.

The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”\n\nBut it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.\n\nWhen Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”\n\nShare this article Share\n\n“I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.\n\nOf course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.",

        "input": "time: 2018-09-18 \n author: Trish Bendix \n source: https://www.intomore.com/culture/alyson-stoner-taps-into-her-sexuality-with-fool \n text: In 2017, Alyson Stoner released a very SEO-friendly YouTube video called “What Happened to Alyson Stoner?” In it, she expressed her frustration with getting the same questions asked of her, over and over, by fans and press alike. As a former child star known for acting and dancing roles in Disney shows, films like Cheaper By the Dozen, and Missy Elliott’s iconic “Work It” music video, Stoner (now 25) is often tasked with explaining where she is now.\n\n“No, I did not die,” she says in the video from last year. Instead, she graduated high school at 14, has appeared in over 150 movies, voiced several animated characters, traveled internationally as both an activist and a performer, and, more recently, came out as queer. Now, poised with a new single, “Fool,” and a growing Instagram following, Stoner is looking to move back into the spotlight. That had to begin, she says, with a realization that the image she was projecting to the world was not exactly her.\n\n“You know, art is supposed to be raw — raw expression — but I grew up in a very commercialized, mainstream platform,” Stoner tells INTO. “So I’ve always carried a bit of an inner diplomat and technician in my songwriting and performances, which makes things a little careful and curated. Maybe digestible, but like boring because it’s not necessarily honest, and I reached a point several months ago where I put it up to my team that I really believe the genuine Alyson is more interesting and capable than the persona we’ve been maintaining.”\n\nIn a world obsessed with transformations, Stoner is recreating her own image, and this time, she says she’s in control.\n\n“I have now been unlocking parts of myself and sharing them in essays, in interviews and podcasts, and it’s funny because people, of course, have to take their time to adjust, but I at least know that when I’m stopped by fans on the street, the conversations are different now,” she says. “It’s not about someone idolizing an unobtainable figure. It’s about someone who found themselves in my story and that is the kind of connection that I’ve always longed for, but I myself have been too timid to tap into.”\n\nPart of Stoner’s story is her sexual fluidity, which she talked about for the first time this spring in a Teen Vogue essay about falling for a woman.\n\n“I, Alyson, am attracted to men, women, and people who identify in other ways,” she wrote. “I can love people of every gender identity and expression. It is the soul that captivates me. It is the love we can build and the goodness we can contribute to the world by supporting each other’s best journeys.”\n\nOver the weekend, Stoner appeared at her first GLAAD event since coming out, presenting an award to #BornPerfect’s Mathew Shurka. As her personal platform grows, so does her visibility as a now openly queer LGBTQ activist and artist, something other out public figures might consider a double-edged sword.\n\n“[People believe] that I’m sharing my sexuality because it’s more popular now,” she says. “I’m sure I could have created some controversy and maybe have gotten more attention and more streams, but I don’t want to look back and feel like I could have been more sensitive to people watching.”\n\nStoner’s brand is largely positivity — optimism, mental health, self-expression and, perhaps most importantly, engagement. Most of her Instagram posts ask for commenters to share their own feelings, thoughts, or memories, or even their choice of emoji. She’s often quick to respond to them indivudally, offering personalized connections as best she can. But with “Fool,” a song that she says has a “sexuality and a sensuality to it,” that has been scary for her to tap into; her concern is that she’s moving into a new, rawer direction that might be off-putting.\n\n“Yeah, I’m just like a nun/Feeling lonely as fuck/And I want you/On the floor, on the chair, I don’t care/Anywhere that you want to,” she sings, in her most explicit song yet. Even though she’s an adult woman, Stoner is still working against the archetype set up for her; the same that Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, and other former child stars have had to work against.\n\n“For me, the song kind of only makes sense as a metaphor,” Stoner says. “It’s when you’re sleeping in, when you’re getting ready to go out, when you’re in the shower. It’s someone kissing you down your spine, it’s being held, sinking into pillows, driving down the coast. So, it’s all of these sensations and instead of creating an inspirational anthem, I really wanted the song to be an invitation inside my senses.”\n\nDespite being an accomplished dancer (she frequently shares her moves on social media and has taught classes at the famed L.A.-based Millennium Dance Complex), Stoner says she still struggles to be as in touch with her body as she wants to be — and that relates both to her artistry and her sexuality. She acknowledges the irony, but has found a way through both to reconnect with herself — it just happens to coincide with her reemergence into the public eye.\n\n“I’m one of the few in my generation who remained private about their personal life and generally pretty modest throughout my career, so I also have the concern and responsibility of potentially disappointing people and being judged by fans who depend on me to stay in a certain box. As much as I’d like to say my dance gave me an edge on people, I actually feel the opposite. But now, because of the healing and therapy and learning to love and accept myself, now I feel like I’m getting to experience life fully. And you know, I felt so good singing this song. I want everyone who listens to feel as good as I do when I’m singing it.”\n\nOf course, coming out, even in 2018, is considered risky for anyone who is selling the world on buying them as an individual. (Stoner is still an actor, but says in her 2017 video she prefers to tell her own stories now.) And as any former child star can attest to, that wholesome and assumed heterosexual image can work against you once you grow older.\n\n“First and foremost, my focus is on making sure I seek to understand other people before expecting to be understood,” she says, “and I understand that having a microphone automatically qualifies whatever the person says as expertise or things that can be later used against the person. I don’t think I can speak out about loving women and then not alienate certain people who disagree with that. And I consider it a special honor to be able to participate in these conversations, but I believe that my position hopefully always is going to be one of a student and I just simply don’t — I don’t have peace with seeing injustice and discrimination and not doing everything in my capacity to understand how we got here and find a way to play mediator between the sides.”\n\nWhile happy to participate in conversations with the conservative fans who would rather remember her as a desexualized performer with kid-friendly messaging, Stoner says she doesn’t take representing LGBTQs lightly.\n\n“It’s not a responsibility that I demand or expect, but it does sometimes happen subsequently and I try my best to make sure I’m going above and beyond to find sources and people and build relationships in all of the communities on every side so that I’m informed,” she says. “So that when I’m making decisions and I’m speaking out on something, I am not just following talking points that were given to me.”\n\nStoner says she’s hoping followers will take the opportunity to get to know the real Alyson, now that she’s ready to show them.\n\n“I don’t think people know my heart and what I value. And I think that’s because I withheld that information and now, through writing articles, through performing, I plan to be way more transparent. I don’t need people to know me perfectly. I can never control their perceptions, but I really do want people to know that I’m an ally for anyone who’s trying to pursue wholeness.”\n\nImages via Getty",

If you came here for tips I can give y’all the biggest one straight off...\n\n\"If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.\"\n\nThen it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.\n\nThe only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.\n\nThere was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.\n\nLoop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.\n\nRihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so \"believe in your dreams\", as cliche as it may sound.\n\nRihanna added:\n\n\"I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”\n\n(Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony.

Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”\n\nThere are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.\n\n“She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they’ll definitely be in a better place.”\n\nAs for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we’re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt. After all, they were just spotted looking totally in love on Aug. 20! Plus, HollywoodLife.com has heard EXCLUSIVELY that they already have plans for a fun Labor Day together, so hopefully he’ll pop back up on her social media this weekend!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Blake and Miranda will meet up?",

Most of those absences were to be expected, but one question remained: Where is Jen Bunney now? The reality TV alum appeared on both MTV series, Laguna Beach and The Hills, but then she kind of disappeared from the public eye. As it turns out, Bunney has been leading a totally normal life, and plays a super special part in the Montag-Pratt family.\n\nFans first got to know Bunney as Lauren \"LC\" Conrad's childhood best friend on Laguna Beach. She gained more notoriety from her stint on The Hills, but not necessarily in the most positive way. Bunney was more or less framed as a \"villain\" on the show — seemingly causing drama and generally stirring an already tumultuous pot.\n\nThings got particularly rough during Bunney's 21st birthday party, though. At the time, Conrad — who gifted Bunney diamonds that night, by the way — had been crushing on Brody Jenner post-Jason Wahler breakup. The birthday girl was well-aware of Conrad's feelings, but she ended up hooking up with Jenner anyway. Let's just say, it did not go over well.\n\nThis pretty much led to the demise of Conrad and Bunney's friendship. It's worth noting, however, that Jenner told Yahoo Style in 2015 that he and Bunney never really hooked up. He said the whole thing was basically fabricated drama, but it's unclear whether or not Conrad was actually aware of that during filming.\n\nDespite Bunney and Conrad's falling out, Bunney still keeps in touch with a few other Hills cast members: the notorious duo Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt. Back in 2014, Montag and Pratt were guests at Bunney's wedding to Taylor Dunphy. “Jen has been my best friend for years,\" Montag told Us Weekly. \"We have been through so much together, she deserves her dream wedding and bliss, and she got it.\"\n\nNot only that, but in October 2016, Montag and Pratt named Bunney godmother to their son Gunner. According to E! News, Montag posted a video with Bunney on her Instagram Stories, telling the camera, \"Cheers! I have one of Gunner's godmothers here, Jen Bunney.\" Bunney then raised a glass and replied, \"We're celebrating Gunner. He's the best baby ever. We love him so much.\" How cute.\n\nIn addition to being a wife, a godmother, and friend to the Montag-Pratts, Bunney currently lives in Los Angeles, works in the healthcare field, is earning her master's degree in public health at University of California, Berkeley, as per PopSugar. Sounds like she's doing pretty good for herself, eh? Who needs The Hills when you've got all of that going on?\n\nIt's unclear whether or not Bunney will end up making an appearance on The Hills: New Beginnings at all. Either way, if she ever ends up missing her good ol' days on reality TV, she can always queue up the DVDs or crank up \"Unwritten.\"",

A little bit, if only when pitted against contemporary ethics. As the original, animated version of the film unspooled at the Hollywood Bowl Friday night in a combination of screening and all-star live musical performance, it was clear that a few of the moral lessons imparted in 1991 seem slightly out of step with the mores of 2018.\n\nThe concept of captivity as a breeding ground for romance seems ripe for a #BelleToo response. And however eagerly we await the beast’s screen redemption, surely all the psychological think-pieces of the last few years have disabused us of believing clinical narcissism is even remotely a curable condition. As for the idea that the west wing is the most treacherous place a person could venture… well, okay, that one still holds.\n\nBut the songwriting team of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken could sell us on anything, and after their “you’ll believe a plant can jive” introduction with “Little Shop of Horrors” and revivification of an entire artform with “Little Mermaid,” they went so big with “Beauty” that it still stands as just about anyone’s conception of what an animated song score should be. It got the adoring tribute it deserved Friday in the first of two Bowl shows that had Zooey Deschanel, Taye Diggs, Rebel Wilson, Kelsey Grammer and Jane Krakowski giving flesh to the toons, and tunes, between 2D dialogue-and-action scenes that had a full orchestra working full-time.\n\nIf there’s anything that’s not going to date in the slightest, it’s Ashman/Menken’s take on love in first bloom, fairy-tale or otherwise — best summed up in a couple of ridiculously simple but classic lines: “There may be something there that wasn’t there before” and, of course, “New, and a bit alarming,” a lyric that can apply about equally to interspecies dating or, really, any first crush.\n\nLiving up to her PG-13 reputation, Wilson introduced a previously unheard bit of dialogue to the song “Gaston” that may or may not have been scripted for the occasion. Cross-dressing in a suit and poufy brunette wig as Gaston’s foppish sidekick, LeFou (who was still ambiguously gay at most in the 2017 live-action movie remake), Wilson explained why Belle would surely have to chill with the villain, asking: “What’s her other option, bestiality?” It’d be interesting to learn whether Disney signed off on that ad lib — but finally, in an official version, someone has addressed the hairy elephant in the room.\n\nWilson counts as enjoyable stunt casting, if no one was about to rate her vocal chops against anyone else’s on the stage. The producers had enough faith that these two would be the ones a Bowl audience would most want to see up-close that they gave them a separate perch halfway up in the audience, so that they could perform their parts of the final big number, “The Mob Song,” apart from the rest of the rabble to the back of the Bowl. There’s been some LeFou/Gaston fan fiction, so let’s see if we get any Rebel Wilson/Taye Diggs fanfic out of this production.\n\nMost of the rest of the casting was more on the nose. For Lumiere, you could hardly find anyone who combines buttoned-up and boisterous — and with an agreeably haughty accent — better than Grammer. Krakowski makes for a slightly slinkier Mrs. Potts than Angela Lansbury might have had us imagining, but she resisted any temptation to go all “Nine” on us in the role, only running her hands down the sides of her white dress once. Ending her rendition of the title song with the number’s traditional spoken-word asides to young Chip, Krakowski’s British accent was endearingly maternal enough that you wished the show could find a way to have the actors do all the dialogue as well as singing, technically challenging as that synch might be.\n\nMichael Buckner/Variety\n\nAs Belle, Deschanel did not have as big a stage presence or booming a voice as Sara Bareilles did when she played Ariel in a similar Bowl production of “Little Mermaid” two summers ago, but wide-eyed winsomeness goes a long way when the part is as small as this one actually is. When Deschanel stepped out onto the semicircular wall that separates the Bowl’s “pool circle” seats from the garden boxes to sing “Belle (Reprise)” not too long into the first act, anyone who knows the score knew this was practically a curtain call for the leading lady, since the character only participates in one other song later on.\n\nMichael Buckner/Variety\n\nBut that’s one of several peculiarities that you don’t really think about when you’re watching the Disney movie, but have to think about when transferred to a live medium. (This was the case with “Little Mermaid,” too, where the heroine also gets a big, introductory quest number and not much else to sing.) Inherent limitations to the original film that a stage producer has to deal with: There are just six songs in the whole movie (not counting reprises); the Beast only sings four lines in the film; there’s no 11:00 number, etc.\n\nDirector Richard Kraft has made a lot of canny calls. A film-scoring agent turned director, he brings a deep knowledge and love of Disneyana to some of the tiny staging touches as well as major creative decisions. He made especially great choices in bringing additional songs to incorporate to flesh out the show from its cinematic origins.\n\nNeither of the two added numbers was as musically strong as the six original Ashman/Menken film tunes, but both were nonetheless standouts, for different reasons. An unbilled Marissa Jaret Winokur, of Tony-winning “Hairspray” fame, appeared after intermission to play the castle’s warbling wardrobe in “Human Again,” a song that was cut from the ’91 film during production but fully animated and added for the 2002 DVD (as well as the Broadway version). And while the previously heard version was more of an ensemble number, Kraft went back and found some unused lyrics from Menken’s original 11-verse draft to make it an essentially solo showcase for one particular piece of furniture. Winokur, in her best diva mode, had a great introduction for the number: “I never dreamed my return to the Hollywood Bowl would be as wardrobe!”\n\nThe other added number had an even more unexpected payoff. “Evermore” was written by Menken and Tim Rice for last year’s live-action movie remake, as a big ballad that would give the beast an entire tune to sing. The fact that it didn’t get a best song Oscar nomination belied the belief of many viewers felt it came off as filler in the film. But something transformative happened in handing this song over to the least known member of the Bowl cast, Anthony Evans, an African-American singer alternately known for being a “Voice” contestant and a handful of Christian records. However much the song didn’t quite come off on screen being sung by an animated mongrel with an angry baritone, it very much worked sung in a higher register by a powerhouse belter whose emotions weren’t masked behind computer generated whiskers. Least of billing, Evans was the star of the night as far as much of the audience was concerned, and the kind of surprise happy ending you hope for in a production where other climaxes are preordained. Menken had to feel pleased, if not vindicated, for “Evermore’s” own happily-ever-after.\n\nIn lieu of anyone trying to fill in for Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson for a duet version at the close, Menken himself came out to perform the song on piano, as a sweetly understated climax. That was the last of several pleasing guest spots that took place outside the context of the screening itself, including an introductory medley by D-Cappella, a flashy violin-and-cello pairing by Sandy Cameron and Tina Guo to come out of intermission, and best of all, a performance of “Flight of the Bumblebee” by 16-year-old pianist Emily Bear to accompany the showing of a 1948 Disney short, “Bumble Boogie.”\n\nOther winning touches included themed lighting of the interior of the Bowl shell — when the beast lit a fire, the dome flickered pink and red — and semi-animated projections onto the entire proscenium that smartly but unobtrusively made the screening feel like more of a widescreen experience. Kraft’s Disney love reached peak status when he brought out an actual whistler (Stephen Van Dorn, who played Cogsworth) to recreate the sound of Mickey’s cheerful blowing during the bit of “Steamboat Willie” that accompanies the Disney Animation Studios title card — the most delightfully silly moment in a silly-symphony kind of night.",

Kim and Park, whose roles had been conceived as supporting, had made less from the get-go; sources said they were offered salaries close to, but not equal to, that of the leads.\n\nSaying it was time to “close that chapter…and begin this chapter” of his life, Kim said this morning he “could not be more excited to be back on ABC,” where he had been part of the cast of Lost, which he credited with launching his career. “This is the start of something new.”\n\nAnd yet, the first question asked during The Good Doctor Q&A was from a critic demanding to know how come he’s not on the CBS series and is now “behind the scenes” on ABC’s doc drama.\n\n“Good morning,” Kim responded calmly, getting a laugh.\n\n“I’m very proud to be part of this show,” said Kim, who is exec producer on The Good Doctor, which he says he first saw several years ago in Korea and brought to ABC.\n\n“It started as a Korean show,” Kim said. “I loved the message of it,” noting also that the doctor drama is a “familiar genre to American audiences.” The Good Doctor centers on Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore), a young surgeon with autism and savant syndrome, who leaves a quiet country life to join a prestigious hospital’s surgical unit.\n\nKim said he brought the format to the U.S., calling it “crucial” to have signed House’s David Shore as EP.\n\n“I am really content being behind the scenes” on the new ABC drama, Kim says, calling it “fascinating” to watch the actors, as a producer.\n\n“At some point I would love to play with them…David and I have talked about it in the past and we’ll see what comes up.’",

Her debut album, the pop-rock “Don’t Forget,” released in 2008.\n\nAs a regular on the Disney series “Sonny with a Chance,” and Lovato became one of the network’s brightest young stars.\n\nHer second album, “Here We Go Again,” released in 2009.\n\nAfter three seasons on “Sonny with a Chance,” Lovato announced she was leaving the show to focus on recording and her third album, “Unbroken.”\n\nShe later had a recurring role on the Fox series “Glee” and served as a judge on the reality singing competition “The X-Factor” for two seasons.\n\nLovato’s self-titled album, “Demi,” released in 2013.

Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”\n\nThe “Friends” star, 49, and Theroux, 46, a screenwriter and actor lauded for his performance in HBO’s “The Leftovers,” were engaged in August of 2012. They married in August 2015 in an intimate but star-studded in the garden of their $21 million minimalist estate in Bel-Air. Jimmy Kimmel officiated, according to Harpers Bazaar.\n\nAniston was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005. As she and Pitt were breaking up, Pitt’s romance with Angelina Jolie became public.\n\nThe announcement that Aniston and Theroux are done comes just a few days after the actress celebrated her 49th birthday Sunday in Malibu with girlfriends, including Courtney Cox. Theroux, meanwhile, was across the country for New York fashion week, Us Weekly reported.\n\nSources recently told People that their busy schedules worked for both of them and helped their marriage.\n\n“Justin often spends a few days in NYC by himself,” a source People. “When he is in NYC, Jen will catch up with friends and enjoys her own life. When Justin is in L.A., it’s very special for them. They socialize together with friends. They often go out to dinner or have people over.”\n\nBut Aniston told a story of marital bliss in a conversation with actress, comedian and writer Amy Sedaris, published in September in Harper’s Bazaar. The two shared happy memories of Aniston’s wedding to Theroux. Sedaris, who is a good friend of Theroux’, served as his “best man.”\n\n“Everything about that wedding was perfect,” Sedaris said. “Everyone was dressed like a bunch of woodland creatures, and your dress looked so beautiful and breezy.”\n\nAniston said it was “fun” to revisit a video of the wedding Theroux had just given her.\n\nBut the actress, who has a passion for interior design, also talked about the challenges of working together on updating their Bel-Air mansion, which is featured on the March cover of Architectural Digest.\n\n“They say building houses can make or break a couple,” Aniston said. “I was so used to doing it on my own, and there were moments when I was like, ‘Don’t say no so fast.’ I have this dialogue with my interior designer where I’ll go: ‘No. Hate it. Move. Next.’ That can sound a little abrupt, so I had to retool my attitude a bit. It wasn’t very hard because he loved whatever I brought to him.”",

In this article I have some nail care tips for you, as well as 50 awesome Halloween nail art design ideas.\n\nAre you as excited for Halloween as I am? If I could dress up in a costume every day of October, I would. Unfortunately, once you reach a certain age that’s not exactly appropriate. Instead, I can interject some Halloween spirit with Halloween nail art designs. Sometimes, Halloween nails can also really improve my costume – bloody nails for a zombie costume, long, pointy nails for a witch costume, or animal-print nails to go with a jungle creature costume.\n\nSalon or DIY for your Halloween Nails?\n\nAre you unsure whether you should do your nails at home, or get them done by a professional? First decide what kind of nails you want, and how steady your hand is. For some Halloween nail designs, doing it yourself at home is totally doable. All you need is a few Halloween-themed nail stickers, and some orange and black nail polish. You’ll also see some simple bloody Halloween nail design ideas, which would be pretty easy to achieve.\n\nOn the other hand, if the design you want is very complicated, or requires a nail printer, going to a salon might be for the best. In every city there are at least a few nail artists that are pros at creating really unique designs. Additionally, Halloween is a great time to go out of your comfort zone, with gel nails or pointy acrylics -you can simply use them to accentuate a cat or witch costume.\n\nGreat Halloween Nails Are Healthy Halloween Nails!\n\nTo make sure your Halloween manicure looks truly fabulous (or that you have enough space to draw all those intricate designs), make sure your nails are strong and healthy. This is doubly important if you’re going to do something more intense, like acrylics.\n\n• Make sure to regularly moisturize your nail beds with coconut oil or shea butter.\n\n• Get enough calcium and vitamin B in your diet, or take a supplement.\n\n• File your nails with an emery board, instead of trimming them.\n\n50 Spooky Halloween Nail Art Designs\n\nSo your nails look good? I have some cute, some stylish, and some straight up scary Halloween nail design ideas coming your way!\n\n1. Ghouls and Pumpkins Halloween Nails\n\nYou don’t have to have long nails for cute Halloween nail art ideas! You can give each finger a cute Halloween character or motif, like the ghouls, pumpkins, mummies, and spider webs in this design.\n\n2. This is Halloween Nails\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas is a quirky Halloween classic, so pay homage to it with your nails! Jack Skellington’s face is undeniably Halloween even for the uninitiate, while Sally’s tattered ragdoll dress design is chic and abstract.\n\n3. Creepy Crawly Nails\n\nThese insect Halloween nail designs are weirdly sophisticated. The bugs are hand drawn with a graphic flourish, and the matte finish only adds to the biologist’s sketchbook effect.\n\n4. Cutie Crawly Nails\n\nSo spiders are not technically insects, but they also don’t smile this wide normally! There are plenty of cute Halloween nail art ideas, like these purple nails with spider and spider webs on the accent nails, and large chunks of glitter on the rest of the nails.\n\n5. Classy Witch Nails\n\nYou don’t dig the obvious Halloween nail designs? Try something more abstract, with these sharp witchy nails.

Amid the backlash that West is receiving for making controversial comments, reports are coming out that their marriage could be coming to an end soon. Most of those rumors also insinuate that Kardashian is planning to end the marriage.\n\nAccording to a recent report from Grazia, Kardashian is planning to leave West and even has an “escape plan” to leave him.\n\n“Things between her and Kanye are at a breaking point. The marriage has been under increasing pressure lately and she fears all the controversy Kanye is causing is reflecting negatively on her and her family. There’s concern this marriage is on borrowed time. Kim may come across as his long-suffering wife, but she has been ready to leave on a number of occasions and has had multiple exit strategies in place over the years.”\n\nGossip Cop has since debunked the rumor that Kardashian has “exit strategies” and an “escape plan” in place to get away from West. She has shown some frustration with his controversial comments, but the two seems to be doing just fine despite all of the rumors.\n\n“None of this adds up to a divorce. In fact, Kardashian’s rep has already gone on record to tell Gossip Cop it’s ‘false’ she’s intending end the marriage. That will be evident in a few days, when the couple marks their fourth wedding anniversary on May 24.”\n\nKardashian has come out and publicly joked that West is the cause of her first gray hair.\n\n“[Kanye] gave me my first gray hair this week, and I am blaming that on him.”\n\nThat is nothing to write home about as far as divorce rumors are concerned. She also went on to state that West is doing well and is out in Wyoming working on new music.\n\n“He’s doing really good. He’s in Wyoming recording, he has a couple of albums coming out, so he’s just focused on that.”\n\nWest even took to Twitter to post a picture of Kim with fire emoji’s as the only description. Obviously, he still finds his wife incredibly beautiful.\n\nRumors are going to continue swirling. Nothing is going to change on the fake report front when it comes to Kardashian and West, but this report can be ignored now that Gossip Cop has debunked it.",

For comparison, Forbes estimates that Jenner's older sister Kim Kardashian West is worth roughly $350 million.\n\nJenny Cheng/Business Insider\n\nThe 20-year-old's net worth has skyrocketed thanks to the success of Kylie Cosmetics.

Sweetin, 35, and Hodak, 40, just broke up after a year long engagement and Sweetin went on to get a restraining order. The court order required Hodak to stay 100 yards away from her, her job, her home, her children’s school and her vehicle. It also prohibited Hodak from contacting Sweetin in any way whether directly or indirectly.\n\nHodak arrested\n\nThe ex-fiancé clearly could not adhere to the restraining order and was arrested at Sweetin’s Sherman Oaks home in Carlifonia on Monday. It was merely days after the actress got the restraining order when Hodak showed up at her home. Sweetin called the police when she saw a suspicious vehicle outside her home and the cops swung in and arrested Hodak from his car. It was the second time he was arrested in a week as he was previously caught for unlawful possession of a firearm, as a convicted felon Hodak is not allowed to possess a rifle.\n\nRaging arguments fractured their relationship\n\nThe two had a heated fight earlier on in the month that prompted Sweetin to call off the engagement. The fight, that estranged the two lovers, was escalated by Hodak’s rage. He was using testosterone supplements and steroids that were saidb to have fuelled his anger. The court documents had some revealing information stating that Hodak was abusing alcohol and marijuana on the said day. In the documents, Hodak supposedly threatened to commit suicide if Sweetin made him leave. Hodak left the house a while later armed with a 9mm pistol.\n\nThe court documents also state that Hodak had confessed to Sweetin about a drug problem and incarceration due to felony offences such as assault with a deadly weapon so as to support the habit. Hodak kept pestering the actress and made 87 phone calls just between the time of the break up and obtaining of the Emergency Protective Order. In addition to this, he also threatened to sell compromising photos of Sweetin which he keeps on his phone.\n\nA narrative of abuse\n\nIn the documents, Jodie Sweetin also admits to abuse on various other altercations. The two lovers often had arguments where Hodak would throw things at Sweetin. At one time, during a previous break-up, Hodak followed Sweetin to Burbank at the Warner Bros. studios demanding to talk to her where he got into a push and shove with the security guards. In another incidence, Hodak waited for the actress outside her children’s school for a confrontation.\n\nJodie Sweetin stated, through her spokesperson, that she would appreciate privacy at this time. The scary situation has not been fully settled, however, Sweetin’s restraining order offers protection to people close to her including; her parents, daughters and assistant.",

Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this story. We're told there's no truth to it.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\"Pretty Flabby Woman? Julia's Detox Diet Driving Danny Moder Mad,\" reads a new RadarOnline headline. The accompanying article says Roberts is trying to lose weight after portraying a frumpy mom in the upcoming drama Ben Is Back, but she's also making her husband eat the same healthy foods as her.\n\nA supposed source tells the site, \"She's demanding they eat only 'colorful' fruits and veggies, raw nuts and seeds… No meat, no dairy, no sugar, no processed stuff.\" The alleged insider further contends that Roberts acts like \"a crazed hungry person\" and gets \"irritable\" whenever she's dieting, which leads to fights between the actress and her husband.\n\nThe suspicious tipster also claims that Moder will sometimes attempt \"to sneak out for a snack,\" but \"Julia actually smells his breath when he gets back.\" The unreliable blog ends its piece by randomly recycling old rumors about the cinematographer because jealous of his wife's \"reconnection with former Pretty Woman co-star Richard Gere,\" which isn't the case.\n\nBut Gossip Cop checked in with a source close to the situation, who exclusively assures us that Roberts isn't on any sort of \"detox diet,\" nor is she concerned about her weight. In fact, photos from the set of Ben Is Back show that the actress isn't the least bit \"flabby,\" despite the blog's mean assertion otherwise.\n\nAlso, Roberts has revealed in the past what she eats during a typical day, and her meals don't consist of what's listed above. The actress acknowledges she stays healthy by eating lots of protein and vegetables, but also admitted, \"I love a good cookie!\" Roberts further noted that she'll often indulge in pasta dishes.\n\nUnfortunately, we're not surprised by RadarOnline's bogus story, considering that the site frequently alleges that Roberts and Moder are having marriage problems. Gossip Cop previously called out the website for wrongly reporting that the actress was caught kissing a \"mystery man\" at a restaurant. The so-called \"mystery man\" was actually Roberts' longtime agent, Richard Lovett, and there was nothing remotely romantic about their smooch. This latest article surrounding a \"detox diet\" is more lies.\n\nMore on Gossip Cop:\n\nJennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt are NOT getting married again despite report\n\nFergie's national anthem is NOT a result of drug relapse despite report\n\nIs Tiffany Haddish dating Lamar Odom?",
        "output": "Source reliability: The source of the news, RadarOnline, has a history of publishing false stories and rumors about celebrities, as mentioned in the article. Gossip Cop, on the other hand, is known for debunking such false reports and has a reputation for fact-checking celebrity news.\n\nAuthor background: The author of the RadarOnline article is not mentioned, which raises questions about the credibility and expertise of the person behind the story. In contrast, Gossip Cop relies on sources close to the situation and has a track record of providing accurate information.\n\nEvidence test: The claims made in the RadarOnline article lack concrete evidence to support them. The supposed insider's statements about Julia Roberts' diet and behavior are not backed up with any verifiable proof. In contrast, Gossip Cop's information is based on checking with reliable sources and providing evidence to refute the false claims.\n\nLanguage style: The language used in the RadarOnline article is sensationalized and focuses on creating drama around Julia Roberts' supposed diet and relationship issues. In contrast, Gossip Cop's language is more factual and objective, focusing on debunking false claims with evidence.\n\nOther analysis: The history of RadarOnline publishing false stories about Julia Roberts and her husband, as well as Gossip Cop's track record of accurately debunking such rumors, further supports the conclusion that the news is fake. Additionally, the lack of consistency between the claims in the article and known facts about Julia Roberts' diet and lifestyle adds to the suspicion of the story's authenticity.\n\nlabel: fake",

These claims are baseless and lack credibility. Additionally, the article cites old rumors about their relationship, which further undermines its reliability.\n\nlabel: fake"

To live forever - or at least avoid death until you are ready - sounds good on paper, but if sci-fi has taught us anything, it's to be careful what you wish for.\n\nI couldn't help but ask the Altered Carbon cast if they'd considered the same question when I sat down with them to talk about the series recently, and I was surprised that their answers were more complex than a simple yes or no. Playing these roles has obviously bought out their inner philosophers...\n\nBig Questions 10 questions I have after watching Altered Carbon\n\n\"I’m not convinced by the whole immortality thing,\" says James Purefoy, who plays Laurens Bancroft, \"I think that way a lot of problems lie.\" Star of the show Joel Kinnaman agrees with the message of Altered Carbon, that cheating death would be bad for humanity, but personally, he'd go for it! \"It probably wouldn't be good for society as a whole, but if you gave me as an individual the opportunity to continue to live, I would take it. It’s very hard to turn that down,\" he told me.\n\nOf course, living forever isn't the only possibility being resleeved offers... you could also be resleeved into someone else entirely and find out what it was like to be a world-renowned boxer or a millionaire for a day. When asked who'd she'd most like to be resleeved as, Renee Elise Goldsberry, who plays Quellcrist Falconer, didn't hesitate. “I think I would enjoy being Michelle Obama,\" the actress says. \"I’d like to know how it felt in that world to be inside a women that actually is as powerful as some of the women I play.\" Good answer.\n\nWatch our interview above for the cast's full answers on whether they'd be resleeved or not, and who'd they'd be resleeved as if they could (Kinnaman is a basketball fan!), or for more Altered Carbon insights and revelations, here's what the series has in common with Doctor Who according to its star.",

Kim has reportedly made the decision to file for divorce from Yeezy and is ‘ready to move on’ with her life. Her alleged decision stemmed from his 2016 hospitalization.\n\nKim Kardashian, 37, will be filing for divorce from Kanye West, 40, Life & Style reports, adding that “it’s officially over” between the power couple. “She is ready to move on with her life,” an insider tells the mag. After Ye’s 2016 hospitalization, where reports claimed he suffered a mental breakdown, the source says that things only got worse with his “erratic behavior.” Upon his release from UCLA Medical Center [back in Nov. 2016], Kanye’s felt “spied on,” by Kim, which has caused him to come distant, as reported by the mag. “Kanye will go days without talking to her. He’s hot and he’s cold. Even their sex life isn’t what it used to be.”\n\nThe mag goes on to report that Kanye is hiding dark secrets, that only Kim knows about. Around the time of his hospitalization, he told Kim about his alleged drug use, which involved both liquid and traditional marajuana among other substances, a second source claims. Despite Kim’s rep denying the divorce report, Life & Style still continues to report that the couple is struggling. The mag claims that Kanye doesn’t trust anyone and that the pair has recently been fighting over him spending time away from Kim and the kids — North, 4, and Saint, 1. Kimye are also expecting their third child together, via surrogate, as Kim has been vocal about issues with her past pregnancies. The source adds that “Kim was hoping this baby would bring them closer, but it hasn’t.”\n\nKim and Kanye recently jetted off to Utah for a weekend getaway for her 37th birthday; a trip that mag claims was a “bust” because Kim was bored the entire time, despite Ye’ loving it. Ultimately, “she’s tired and she’s done with this marriage,” the insider says. “Kanye makes it very difficult for her. She loves being a mother, but she wants it all and Kanye can’t give that to her… Kim definitely wants out of the marriage.” The mag also claims that even with a third child on the way, Kim is set on her alleged decision to leave Ye’.\n\nKim and Kanye have yet to address the divorce reports. The pair looked happier than ever at her 37th birthday dinner with her friends and family on Oct. 26. Ye’ sang “Happy Birthday” to Kim, with the rest of her loved ones, and she documented the entire night. And, the countless, loving videos didn’t hint at a split if you ask us!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you really think Kimye are splitting?",

He wasn’t. The viewers may think he was, but he wasn’t,” Vicki explained to E! News. “Did he turn into a monster towards the end? He did a lot of weird ass crazy things that I still don’t understand because I don’t talk to him.”\n\nShe added, “I don’t know why he did what he did, but he wasn’t a monster. He wasn’t really the man I thought he was if he did what he did to me.”\n\nIn fact, Vicki says if she could talk to Brooks one on one she’d ask him one question: why?\n\n“Why did you reveal bad records? Why did you do what you did to me?” Vicki explained. “We had a good thing going, or so I thought, but why? I still don’t know why. I’ve never been able to get the answer from him.”\n\nIf you don’t remember Brooks faked cancer and showed off fake cancer documents to the media and Vicki’s RHOC co-stars in hopes of shutting down doubts about his health.\n\nUltimately, it was revealed that Brooks never had cancer and was never treated by City of Hope Medical Center.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, Vicki called her relationship with Brooks “great” in the RHOC season 12 premiere. Gag!\n\nOh, Vicki. Somehow I feel like Vicki isn’t fully over Brooks and I don’t think she ever will be. Why is she still talking about him? No one cares. And anything Vicki says about Brooks isn’t going to change people’s minds about Brooks or her possible involvement in his cancer scam. It’s a shame Vicki can’t seem to forget Brooks especially when her new boyfriends seems so great. I want Vicki to be happy, and I think she is with her new man so I wish she’d just close the chapter on Brooks. You know, outta sight outta mind.\n\nThoughts on Vicki’s interview? Why do you think Vicki still talks about Brooks? Was Brooks a monster? Do you believe Vicki never knew anything about Brooks cancer scam? Was Vicki’s relationship with Brooks “great?” Does Vicki need to stop talking about Brooks?\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Instagram.\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Twitter.\n\nLike AllAboutTRH On Facebook.\n\nFollow the AllAboutTRH Podcast on iTunes & Soundcloud – Remember to Rate, Comment & Subscribe!",

        "input": "time: 2012-08-16 \n author: David Amsden \n source: www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/t-magazine/miranda-kerr-goes-kiwi.html \n text: Miranda Kerr was 18, just out of high school, a girl from the Australian countryside curious about what the rest of the world had to offer, when she first visited New Zealand. Along with a close friend from Gunnedah, the pastoral town where she grew up, Kerr set out to experience what for many is the draw of New Zealand: to escape and explore, to get a little lost and, in the process, get a little found. They slept in a tent. Swam in natural hot springs. Hiked terrain so raw and depopulated and expansive it felt as if they were the first humans to discover it. Kerr didn’t know it at the time, but her life would change significantly in the years that followed, thanks largely to her enviable genetic gifts: the long pale legs, the shimmering doe eyes and, most famously, the pert, dimpled cheeks that have made her one of the highest paid, most recognizable models in the world. Modeling, for Kerr, has been its own sort of adventure, one she will be the first to acknowledge as a stroke of good fortune not to be taken for granted. “Still, that backpacking trip, just having that freedom, was one of the best times in my life,” Kerr recently reflected. “Ever since, I’ve wanted to get back to New Zealand.”\n\nFor seven months, beginning last December, Kerr, 29, got her wish. She spent the majority of her nonworking time in Wellington, New Zealand’s capital, where her husband, Orlando Bloom, was filming “The Hobbit,” Peter Jackson’s two-part prequel to the epic “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, the films that first made Bloom a star a decade ago. Wellington — or “Wellywood,” as it’s been christened since Jackson set up his studio empire in the suburb of Miramar — is one of the most remote capitals on the planet: some 28 hours by plane from London, 23 from New York, 15 from Los Angeles, 14 hours from Hong Kong and Tokyo. Of the city’s many charms — its burgeoning restaurant scene, its absurdly picturesque scenery, the mellow Kiwi hospitality you experience everywhere you go — it is Wellington’s physical isolation that makes it such a singular place. During the week I spent in the city, no matter what I was doing, even something as simple as sitting at a cafe sipping a flat white (New Zealand’s richer version of a latte), I felt a palpable remove from the ways and rhythms of the rest of the world. (Being on the other side of the international date line helps.) So while much of Wellington could be compared to, say, Portland, Ore., or Seattle, there is the added seduction of being pleasantly unmoored, able to take in the pleasure of civilization while existing outside of it.\n\nThe circumstances of Kerr’s stay in Wellington were, of course, quite different from her initial visit. She is now the mother of a cherubic young son, Flynn, 19 months, and the tent of her teen years was replaced by an airy, seaside mansion where every window looks out on Wellington Harbour. (The house, lent to the couple by one of the film’s producers, happens to be where Bloom celebrated his 22nd birthday while filming “TLOTR.”) If she wanted to run an errand, or head to an afternoon Pilates class, a production assistant gave her a ride. Sweet perks, no question. And yet, to hear Kerr tell it, the life she and Bloom carved out in Wellington was in many ways a reminder of what existence was like before she became a celebrity, a kind of geographic escape hatch from the scrutiny of tabloids and the curious eyes of strangers. When they first arrived, for instance, they took a road trip that was reminiscent of her earlier journey: aimlessly driving around the countryside, out of reach and out of touch. “We didn’t camp because Flynn’s still a little young for that,” Kerr told me. “But it was just the three of us, nothing to do except be with each other in this shockingly beautiful place.”\n\nKerr and I were having this conversation at Wellington’s Botanic Garden, a sprawling expanse of lush floral curiosities, manicured lawns and shaded labyrinthine walkways offering some of the most extraordinary views of the city. It was hard to imagine that this was the same woman who, a few months earlier, had walked the runway in a $2.5 million bra while Maroon 5 performed at the Victoria’s Secret fashion show; here, in raw-denim jeans and a loose navy sweater, she seemed no different from the other health-conscious young mothers who made up most of the gardens’ visitors. Kerr had come from the set of “The Hobbit,” which she visited most days with Flynn when Bloom, who was reprising his role as the bow-wielding elf Legolas, was working. “There’s a cafeteria where everyone eats lunch, and they’re all in full makeup,” Kerr said. “So you see these poor Orcs” — the demonic goblin soldiers of the film — “trying to eat without ruining their costumes. For Orlando, it’s easier. He just has the blond wig and the pointy ears.”",

We may earn commission from the links on this page.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with it, Jada Pinkett Smith's Red Table Talk is one of the realest talk shows streaming today. As the host, and with the help of her 17-year-old daughter, Willow, and her mother, Adrienne Banfield-Jones, Pinkett Smith comfortably covers juicy topics like sex, love, and family while also interviewing celebrities. And now that the trailer for the second season has dropped, we're anxiously waiting for it to return to Facebook Watch on October 22.\n\nSo how successful was the debut? The hit show is a finalist for the 2018 People's Choice Awards Daytime Talk Show category, and the new season promises major interviews with celebrities like Ellen Pompeo, Leah Remini, and the lead host's husband, Will Smith. In a sneak peak of her interview with Will, he reveals that there was a point in their relationship where she cried for 45 days straight. \"It was every morning,\" he said. \"I think that's the worst I've ever felt in our marriage.\"\n\nBut before we dive into the newest episodes, let's not forget the Red Table Talk moments that hooked us in the first place.\n\nWe learned that Tiffany Haddish had a date with Drake. And he canceled.\n\nAs one of Hollywood's busiest stars—she's in four movies and one TV show this year—Haddish doesn't have much time to date. But the man she did clear her schedule for? Aubrey Graham, a.k.a. Drake.\n\nRelated Story Tiffany Haddish Has the Most Unpredictable Talent\n\nHaddish explained that the rapper asked her to dinner after they met on the set of his \"Nice For What\" music video earlier this year, which she's featured in. She said yes and proceeded to make time on her calendar. \"I go get my mustache waxed, get my armpits waxed, got me a nice little dress,\" she told Pinkett Smith.\n\nBut as the two A-listers were texting back and forth, Haddish soon learned it wasn't meant to be. Turns out, Drake had a \"family emergency.\" In Canada. But being the perfectly blunt comedian that we love, Haddish had the greatest reaction: \"I was like, ‘Okay. Okay! I could have made $100,000 today, but I was trying to see what that D do. But all right!'\"\n\nAnd that Pinkett Smith may have been a little too into self-love.\n\nBy the age of nine, her grandmother taught her all about the wonders of masturbation. As Pinkett Smith said, \"She didn't want me to fall into the hands of a man and, if he gave me pleasure, to think that that was him.\"\n\nBut once she further explored her sexuality as a teenager, things got a little out of hand after she learned how to give herself multiple orgasms: \"I was abstaining from men. And I actually think I went through kind of an addiction, too with it…And then one day I was like, ‘Enough. You're having five orgasms a day.'\"\n\nShe also revealed she's experienced hair loss.\n\nIn an episode titled \"Body Confessionals!\" she explained that the reason she almost exclusively wears a pixie cut isn't for style. One day as she was showering, handfuls of hair came out and she recalls \"shaking with fear.\" She took multiple tests and no one could figure out what caused it, so she ended going for the big chop.\n\nWhile Pinkett Smith once found it empowering to take care of her previously long 'do, she soon discovered that out of all the life losses she could experience, losing her mane was something she could handle. Now, she enjoys her short hair or rocks a head scarf, something she said makes her feel like a queen. \"I watch the higher power take things everyday. And by golly, if the higher power wants to take your hair? That's it.\"\n\nWillow admitted to self-harming as a pre-teen.\n\nWillow Smith shocked both her mother and grandmother when she confessed to cutting herself following the success of her 2010 hit song, \" .\"\n\n\"I had just stopped doing singing lessons and I was kind of just in this gray area of, Who am I? Do I have a purpose? Is there anything I can do besides this?\" she said. \"I was just listening to a lot of dark music, and it was so crazy, and I was just plunged into this black hole.\"\n\nThough it's been five years since she stopped, Willow had only told one friend, leaving her family completely in the dark up until the moment she revealed her story on camera. Her mom said she \"had no idea.\" \"I never talk about it because it was such a short, weird point in my life,\" Willow said. \"But you have to pull yourself out of it.\"\n\nJaden Smith actually moved out when he was 15.\n\nPinkett Smith called it \"one of the most heartbreaking moments\" of her life. Back then, she thought her now 20-year-old son was mature enough to make it. And as the child of a celebrity power couple, it was what he felt he needed to do in order to live his life and find a personal identity. \"Being in this lifestyle, in this world, is a bubble. He wanted out and I understood that,\" she said.\n\n\"It just makes you appreciate being at home, being with your parents, spending quality time with your family,” Jaden added. \"You get out into the world and you just understand things.”\n\nWillow caught her parents in the act.\n\nIndeed a real-life nightmare, she walked in on her parents having sex. Explaining this to her mom Pinkett Smith, she said she was just going downstairs to get some juice. But as soon as she saw what was happening, she ran upstairs because she knew she had \"overstepped a boundary. \"It would be like if I walked in on you meditating. When mommy's meditating, don't get in her business,\" she said.\n\nIn addition, Pinkett Smith feels betrayed by Tupac's death.\n\nShe and the late rapper, Tupac Shakur, became fast friends when they met in high school at Baltimore School for the Arts. Pinkett Smith called them \"inseparable,\" and his 1996 death was a huge loss.\n\n\"My upset is more anger because I feel that he left me,\" she said. \" I know that that's not true, and it's a very selfish way to think about it, but I really did believe that he was gonna be here for the long run.\"\n\nWillow called out the silver lining, explaining that the artist left behind a legacy that hasn't been ignored by the generations that came after him. \"He's an icon and that was what he was meant to do,\" Pinkett Smith said.\n\nApparently, Gabrielle Union and Pinkett Smith squashed their beef.\n\nAfter 17 years of tension, Union and Pinkett Smith finally put their feud to rest in an emotional face-to-face. The reconciliation came as a surprise to many because the two kept their issues out of the public eye. The kicker? They had been friendly acquaintances until one day, they just weren't. In fact, they couldn't pinpoint why they stopped speaking in the first place, which Pinkett Smith called \"some petty ass s—.\"\n\nPinkett Smith also brought up Union's 2013 Essence Black Women in Hollywood speech, in which the actress publicly confessed to a past in which she willingly participated in Hollywood gossip, reveling in the negativity that it caused. Union said that she used to be \"a troll,\" but has since recognized that tearing others down didn't make her life any better.\n\n\"I had to see myself clearly,\" Union said. \"It's ugly, it's hard, it's painful to recognize that you are the common denominator for the vast majority of your problems...You have to mourn the death of who you thought you were.\"",

But it seems that the reality TV star is ready for baby No. 4 and it’s not with her ex.\n\nAt 39, Kourtney Kardashian is still a young woman. But her boyfriend Younes Bendjima is even younger – 24 to be exact. So, even though she currently has her hands full with her kids Mason, 9, Penelope, 5, and Reign, 3, that doesn’t mean she isn’t thinking about having more children later. In fact the reality TV star even toyed with the idea in a February 2018 episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. During the show she told her sisters Kim Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian that she’d been “thinking about freezing” her eggs. Kourtney made it clear why she was thinking about having that extra “insurance,” saying, “What if I want my love to come into the world?”\n\nNow it seems that Kourtney wasn’t just toying with the idea. She’s serious. An insider has exclusively told HollywoodLife of the mom’s future baby making plans. Our Kardashian source said, “Younes wants kids and he wants them with Kourtney – just not yet. She’s on the same page. She loves the way their lives are now and is very happy with her three wonderful kids. But she knows down the road he’ll want children and she wants to be able to give him a baby. And she loves the idea of having him as her baby daddy. She just doesn’t want to rush. That’s why she’s freezing her eggs so that they don’t have to stress about having a baby right away and rush their relationship.”\n\nBut what about Kourtney’s current baby daddy, Scott Disick? What does he think? The insider said, “Scott is furious that Kourtney is seriously planning to have a baby with another man. She always told him that she’d never want to have anyone else’s child. It’s hard enough for Scott to see Kourtney all loved up with Younes. Hearing her talk about her plan to have his kid, even if it’s not anytime soon, sends him over the edge. He’s furious and trying to talk her out of it.”",

The White House today confirmed the call with the Associated Press.\n\nBarr, who co-created and stars in in the show, made a call herself to Good Morning America today to discuss her chat with Trump, and offered more details.\n\n\"We just kind of had a private conversation, but we talked about a lot of things,\" Barr said. \"He was just happy for me. I've known him for a lot of years and he's done a lot of nice things for me over the years, and it's a friendly conversation about working, television, and ratings.\"\n\nBarr added that Trump \"really understands ratings and how they measure things,\" which has \"been an interest of [Barr's] for a long time, too.\"\n\nShe attributed the enthusiastic reception for the Roseanne revival to the way the show treats relationships between people with different political views. As the new season opened, Barr's character had not spoken to her sister Jackie, played by Laurie Metcalf, since the 2016 election. (Like Barr, her character, Roseanne Conner, is a Trump supporter, while Metcalf's Jackie was for Hillary Clinton.) But they soon reconciled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The idea that people can agree to disagree is kind of missing from everything,\" Barr said. \"Conflict resolution and agreeing to disagree are important things. That's what we need to do as a country — figure out what we don't like and talk to each other and discuss how we're going to get it changed or fixed. I hope [the show] opens up civil conversation between people and not just mudslinging. We need to be more civilized than that.\"\n\nDonald Trump Jr. had previously offered his congratulations on Twitter.\n\nEarlier this week, Barr appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live alongside co-star John Goodman to discuss the Roseanne reboot. During the interview, Kimmel told the actress that he was shocked over her vocal support for Trump because she is \"a very socially liberal person in general.\" Barr responded to Kimmel by telling him to \"zip that f– lip.\"\n\n\"I'm still the same. You all moved. You all went too f– far out, you lost everybody,\" she said. \"A lot of us, no matter who we voted for, we don't want to see our president fail. Because we don't want [Vice President Mike] Pence. Are you f– kidding me? You want Pence? You want Pence for the freaking president?

Mandy Moore, whose character delivered a simultaneously heartfelt and humorous eulogy for her late husband underneath his favorite tree, had to grapple not only with the immense emotional weight of the material, but with a seriously distracting nearby ruckus.\n\n“The location we are shooting at was so loud,” Moore said with a laugh during a phone interview with V.F. Wednesday morning. “There was so much traffic, and we were right by an airport, and so there were planes constantly landing.” Understandably, it took a bit of work for Moore to get out of her head into the monologue amid so many distractions. But she knew all too well how important this moment was: as she put it, Rebecca’s speech, delivered for an audience of just her and Jack’s three children, was “a deliberate move on her part . . . to really honor their father; it was her own way for just the four of them to really eulogize him.” She wanted to honor that—and, with a little helpful sound editing, she did, delivering the emotional cornerstone of a crucial episode as the series moves forward from the crushing death of its patriarch.\n\nRebecca starts her eulogy by revealing something she and Jack had never told their children: “Did you know that when your father and I first got married, I wasn’t sure that I ever wanted to have kids? I mean, I figured I would eventually, but . . .” She trails off before jumping to a topic that doesn’t seem relevant—at first: “He was the worst at movies. Wasn’t he? He was just the worst. I mean, as soon as a movie started, he would just figure out who would end up with who or who murdered who. Somehow he was always, always right. It was like he could see things before they happen. You know? I mean, he could see you three before you happened. Thank God he did.”\n\nTo Moore, this scene was a moment of tremendous strength for Rebecca, a grieving, newly single parent to three kids who saw their father as a superhero. She reassures her sons that neither one of them needs to become the new “man of the house,” and insists to Kate that it’s not her fault Jack decided to go back into the house for the family dog—a decision that quite possibly sealed his fate.\n\n“I thought it was so eloquent,” Moore said, before crediting Rebecca’s sit-down with the doctor who delivered her children with fortifying her spirit. Their conversation, she said, “really showed her that she could be the type of parent that Jack was, and that she needed to be for these kids.” The words Rebecca says to Jack’s spirit under the tree—”We’re going to be O.K.”—became the mantra that helped her focus while filming.\n\nAs fans know, though Jack’s death has finally been revealed, Moore’s co-star Milo Ventimiglia is not going anywhere; there’s plenty of Jack’s story left to be told through flashbacks. Plus, Moore notes, “I don’t know if anything’s ever really behind us or in the rearview mirror with this show, because we’re consistently jumping around in time and there’s lots of stuff that we shoot that I have a feeling, when it doesn’t make it an episode, will be used further down the road in some other way.“ She can confirm that we’re pretty much done with this particularly dark moment, but makes no promises that it won’t be examined again in the future.\n\nOne overarching theme of the past few episodes of This Is Us has been Rebecca’s quiet strength—a change of pace from past plotlines in which the Pearson kids seemed to under-appreciate and undervalue their mother. Increasingly, it seems they’re coming to realize just how much pain she shouldered for them—which has been a welcome development for Moore.\n\n“I’m not a mother, but just speaking from my own experience and observations, I feel like moms often are sort of relegated to that,” Moore said. “Not all the time, and that is sweeping generalization—but I feel like moms often are underestimated. Because they do carry, in a lot of cases, so much of the heavy load in life. And I am glad that like the tide has sort of shifted in this season.” And while Jack might have been a superhero on the surface, Rebecca is very much his equal: “They were such a duo and a unit,” Moore said, “And I love that she’s sort of getting her due now.”",

The former President and first lady were spotted helping her move into her dorm at the end of August 2017.\n\nObama went on to describe that his only task, delegated to him by his daughters, was to set up a desk lamp – and even that proved to be difficult for the emotional father.\n\n“It should have taken like five minutes or three minutes,” he joked. “It had one of those wrenches … and it only had like four parts or something. I’m sitting there just toiling away at this thing, it’s taking half an hour. Meanwhile, Michelle’s finished scrubbing and she’s organizing closets. I was pretty pathetic.”\n\nStill, he said he held it together until he and the former first lady were driving away from campus.\n\nMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix\n\n“What’s changed I think from when we were kids is technology,” Obama told Letterman. “So I get home and she (Malia) knows I’m pathetic, so she’s texted me hearts, and, you know, so we are talking on a regular basis. When we were kids, you had to go down to the end of the hall of the dorm (to make a call).”\n\nObama likened the entire move-in experience to “open-heart surgery,” as he previously said in an interview with WDEL radio.\n\nLetterman’s interview with Obama, which was about an hour long, debuts on Netflix Friday.

Rose is, after all, an unforgettable-looking woman, one who had been making a name for herself as a video and print model before Kanye had even met her. (He went out of his way to get an introduction after her striking appearance in the \"What Them Girls Like\" video by Ludacris.) As it stands, it is true that real, paparazzi-level celebrity only arrived on Rose's doorstep when Kanye did, and then her relationship with Khalifa kept her in the spotlight as a trophy wife until their split in 2014. During this time, Rose tried her hand at everything from music and random reality TV guest spots, to a clothing line—all with limited success.\n\nRose appeared, for years, like a genetically-blessed celebrity girlfriend who had little to offer the world other than her stunning style and penchant for fueling gossip. So it's ironic that Rose seemingly only found her footing and her calling once she was single and after she'd been raked over the coals in public one too many times. In the last two years, Amber Rose hasn't just landed on her feet, she's strapped some spiky high-heeled boots on those suckers and trampled over every hater in her vicinity, in an unflinchingly defiant manner.\n\nThe shift started when she showed up to 2015's VMAs wearing a body suit covered in female-specific insults. At Rose's side was Blac Chyna wearing a matching dress. \"GOLD DIGGER,\" \"BITCH,\" \"WHORE,\" \"STRIPPER,\" \"HOE,\" their outfits screamed back at a public all too accustomed to directing these slurs at famous women. It was a surprising nod to the feminist riot grrrl movement of the 1990s—and a stark message that Amber Rose was not going to be shamed out of the way.\n\nLater that year she penned a book, How to Be a Bad Bitch, which sold well. It preached a message of sisterhood, self-acceptance, strength and—in direct contradiction to the title of the thing—good manners. It wasn't a flawlessly written feminist tome, but it did throw a couple of middle fingers at a media that is all too fond of pitting women against one another.\n\nThen there was the pièce de résistance: the Amber Rose SlutWalk. Rose didn't invent the SlutWalk, but she has become an important spokesperson for the reasons why we need them. The one she held in Los Angeles in October 2015 was widely reported on in a way that others are not, precisely because she was at the helm, and precisely because she used it as a platform to speak very openly, and emotionally, about her life experiences and the double standards all women face. Photos of the event show her holding signs that read \"FUCK YO 30 SHOWERS\" and \"STRIPPERS HAVE FEELINGS TOO.\"\n\nThe website accompanying the SlutWalk now serves as a space for women to share their own stories of sexist abuse and slut-shaming, and prides itself on being “a completely inclusive space” with “a zero tolerance policy on all hateful language, racism, sexism, ableism, fat-shaming, transphobia, or any other kind of bigotry.”\n\nThe impact has been sizeable, and Rose has since found herself appearing in sketches for both Inside Amy Schumer and Funny or Die that were equal parts hilarious and subversive.\n\nFunny or Die's \"Walk of No Shame With Amber Rose\" was, in particular, gloriously sex positive:\n\nIn addition to all of this, Rose has become a voice for other celebrity women. Just last week, she came to Taylor Swift's aid, when the singer (another woman on the receiving end of Kanye West's wrath—\"I made that bitch famous\" he raps in \"Famous\") was under scrutiny for having a new love interest.",

        "input": "time: 2018-01-31 \n author: Condé Nast \n source: https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/01/dumbledore-fantastic-beasts-explicitly-gay \n text: When the cast for Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald was first announced, with Jude Law set to play a younger, hotter Dumbledore, fans grew excited, imagining boundless possibilities for this dashing new version of the character. Could the film, perhaps, even include a glimpse at the future Hogwarts headmaster’s romantic life—a subject left open-ended by the original Harry Potter books, though J.K. Rowling confirmed after completing the series that Dumbledore was gay?\n\nWell, no. Director David Yates has revealed that for now, Dumbledore’s sexuality will not make it to screen—at least, “not explicitly.”\n\n“But I think all the fans are aware of that,” Yates continued, speaking to Entertainment Weekly. “He had a very intense relationship with Grindelwald when they were young men. They fell in love with each other’s ideas, and ideology, and each other.”\n\nRowling previously teased the idea that eventually, one of the five planned Fantastic Beasts films will address Dumbledore’s sexuality—but it’s unclear when, or how. “Well, I can’t tell you everything I would like to say because this is obviously a five-part story, so there’s lots to unpack in that relationship,” she said at a press conference in 2016. “I will say that you will see Dumbledore as a younger man, and quite a troubled man because he wasn’t always the sage. He was always very clever, but we’ll see what I think was the formative period of his life. As far as his sexuality is concerned, watch the space.” Rowling responded to the recent controversy on Twitter, complaining that she’d been “sent abuse about an interview that didn't involve me, about a screenplay I wrote but which none of the angry people have read, which is part of a five-movie series that's only one instalment in.”\n\nWhat, exactly, are fans to make of this? Rowling first announced that Dumbledore was gay in 2007, while promoting the final book in her original series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. As she put it to one fan who asked if Dumbledore had ever fallen in love, “I always thought of Dumbledore as gay.” Three Harry Potter films were released after this announcement, but none of them made explicit mention of Dumbledore’s sexuality—understandably, perhaps, since their source material didn’t either. As of now, Dumbledore’s romantic life has been purely the stuff of fan fiction—and apparently, it will remain so for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis approach speaks to a frustrating trend in blockbuster movies, one exemplified by recent films like Power Rangers and Beauty and the Beast. Both movies made headlines by teasing story lines involving explicitly gay characters—or, in the case of Beauty and the Beast, an “exclusively gay moment.” When the movies actually made it to theaters, though, those much-touted scenes amounted to little more than throwaway moments that felt divorced from the rest of the story—blink-and-you’ll-miss-it fragments, rather than true examples of much-needed L.G.B.T. representation. There’s something cynical about explicitly telling L.G.B.T. fans to look out for L.G.B.T. characters—then responding to their attention (and ticket purchases) with weak feints at inclusion, or nothing at all.\n\nAlthough TV continues to make great strides in this arena, film has lagged far behind—and few franchises make that more readily apparent than Fantastic Beasts. Obviously, it’s wrong to write a film off without having seen it—but at the same time, it’s only natural for some fans to feel disappointment at this Dumbledore news. Legions of moviegoers are tired of being teased with the possibility of L.G.B.T. characters, only to have the prospect unceremoniously yanked out from under them. The first Fantastic Beasts already hinged on an obvious gay liberation metaphor involving Ezra Miller’s character, Credence. Why, then, should it bother being coy about Dumbledore’s personal life—especially in a film that essentially pits the character against his terrible ex-boyfriend?\n\nMarketing divisions seem to have figured out already that representation often helps a film’s bottom line; how long will it take for writers and filmmakers to follow suit?",

They were very close and he will miss her dearly. He is staying strong and leaning on close friends and other family during this challenging time.”\n\nMORE: Suri Cruise Is All Grown Up — See the Pic\n\nAccording to reports, Mary died peacefully in her sleep and was sent off with a Scientology ceremony. She was also the one who encouraged Tom to pursue an acting career.\n\nTom and Katie tied the knot in November 2006 and ended their marriage in August 2012. They are also parents to a 10-year-old daughter, Suri — though Tom hasn’t seen her in quite some time.\n\n“They used to Skype and text, but that trailed off drastically. He uses his film commitments as an excuse, but the truth is that doesn’t hold much weight with Suri anymore,” a source previously told In Touch. “Tom eats, breathes and sleeps Scientology. He’s disconnected from Katie, and then de facto from Suri, because of her connection to Katie. He hasn’t seen her since she was seven.”\n\nKatie moved on from the relationship with actor Jamie Foxx, and they were recently spotted spending New Year’s Eve together in Miami.\n\n“They’re very serious,” said a source.\n\nMeanwhile, Tom was recently rumored to be dating a British woman.\n\nMORE: Enter Here for Your Chance to Win a Trip to Miami\n\nWe think it’s great that these two can still lean on each other in the most difficult times — and hope this could lead to him reconnecting with his daughter.\n\nOur thoughts are with Mary’s loved ones in the wake of this tragedy.",

It’s about friendship,” explained Adams of the group chat, not mentioning if they will be working with her. They did consider her as a member in the early 2000s, but she had to decline for another project.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe also said there’s no news from Scherzinger if the Pussycat Dolls will make a comeback.\n\nAfter finding success with Black Eyed Peas, Fergie went solo in 2006, then worked with the group in 2009. She began working on her second solo album “Double Dutchess” in 2013 and released it in September 2017.\n\nIn June 2017, rumors circulated that Fergie had left the group.
